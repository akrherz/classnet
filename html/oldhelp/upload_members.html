You can prepare a file from administrative records or an editor describing
students you want to add or delete and upload this information to ClassNet.
This process is useful when you have multiple student records or have local
procedures which can generate lists of students to be added to the class.<BR>
<BR>
Follow these guidelines in preparing the file:
<UL>
  <LI>Edit a text file
  <LI>The first line should be: #ClassNet1.0:Upload
  <LI>List student information one student per line 
  <LI>To add a student, use the format<BR>
<BR>
+last_name,first_name,password,email_address
  <LI>To delete a student, use the format<BR>
<BR>
-last_name,first_name
  <LI>To include a comment, put a #  in column 1
  <LI>Put the file in a WWW directory, preferably password-protected.
</UL>
<H4>Example<BR>

<PRE>#ClassNet1.0:Upload
+Miller,George,apwd,gmiller@school.edu
#this is a comment
-Clooney,Mary</PRE>

This file would add George Miller and delete Mary Clooney. The filename
you choose for this file should be entered in the Upload editor. (e.g. http://www.school.edu/my_file
if the filename was my_file.)
