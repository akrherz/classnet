How does ClassNet work?</H3></CENTER>
Below is a diagram of a ClassNet server connected to the Internet:
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../gifs/cnet.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" HEIGHT=312 WIDTH=434 ALIGN=BOTTOM></CENTER>


<P>The process begins when an instructor accesses Classnet via the URL
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B><TT>http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/</TT></B></CENTER>


<P>and creates a class using the options provided. Once the class is created,
a student may choose the Enroll option using the same URL. The student
may then view the Student Menu to view grades, communicate with classmates
or change their password.

<P>Students access their class content and tests through URLs provided
by their instructor. Tests are Web pages which may contain multiple-choice,
short-answer and essay questions. When students submit tests, the answers
are forwarded to ClassNet for grading and storage. In most cases, students
are unaware of this process. Students need only access ClassNet directly
to complete assignments, view scores, change their password or email address
or communicate with classmates. Links in the class content can route students
directly to the ClassNet Main Menu.

<P>Instructors access ClassNet to create tests, update class information,
change student passwords and communicate with students. All testing is
automated and occurs after the due date of the test (if any). If a test
includes essay questions, the answers are routed to the instructor via
email.

<H3>
How do I start?</H3></CENTER>
If you are an instructor, click on <B>Create</B> on the ClassNet Main Menu
and supply the requested information. When you submit the information,
it will be sent to the ClassNet adminstrators for approval. You will receive
approval via email within a day. You may then login to your class and begin
to make assignments.

<P>Students enroll themselves by clicking on <B>Enroll</B> on the ClassNet
Main Menu. As an instructor, you can allow them to be enrolled immediately
or approve their request first. If you chose the Approve option for your
class, an <B>Approve</B> button will appear on the instructor's Membership
Menu when students are waiting for approval. Students cannot login until
the approval is given if you are using the Approve option.
<CENTER>
<H3>
Making Assignments</H3></CENTER>

and view grades. ClassNet is designed to support a growing number of assignment
types. The current assignment

Menu. Your current assignments will be listed. To add an assignment, click
on <B>Add</B> in the Assignment Menu and enter the name of the assignment
and its type and click on <B>Add</B>. The assignment will be added to a
