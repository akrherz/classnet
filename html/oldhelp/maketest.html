<P>This will describe how to use <I>ClassNet</I> authoring system to create
a set of multiple choice questions that can be displayed on the Web. It
assumes that you have created a class with yourself as the instructor.
As "instructor" you can do a number of things including creating interactive
episodes for your students and "publishing" them in <I>ClassNet</I> so
your students can choose them when they sign on to <I>ClassNet</I>. You
should have 3 to 5 multiple choice questions written on paper when you
start.
<CENTER><A HREF="idiom.html">The Idiom MC7 Example</A></CENTER>

<H5>
<A NAME="create"></A><FONT COLOR="#000099"><FONT SIZE=-1>Creating an Assignment</FONT></FONT></H5>
To begin you should sign on to your class on <I>ClassNet</I> as an instructor.
From the <B>Instructor Menu</B>, choose <B>Assignments</B>. The <B>Assignments
Menu</B> gives you four options (in addition to the option to return to
the <B>Instructor Menu</B>):
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><B>Edit: </B>Allows you to edit an assignment (such as the multiple
choice test) in the <I>ClassNet </I>assignment editor.
<BR><B>Delete:</B> Allows you to delete an assignment that you have created
from <I>ClassNet.</I>
<BR><B>Add:</B> Allows you to create an assignment and include its name
on the <I>ClassNet</I> menu.
<BR><B>Mail:</B> Allows you to mail a copy of the text file containing
the code for your assignment to yourself. You do this if you want to see
the text file that the editor creates, and if you want to edit the text
file in a plain text editor.</UL>
To create your multiple choice test, you should select <B>Add</B>. The
<B>Add Assignment Menu</B> requests three pieces of information:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><B>Type:</B> This refers to the type of episode you are constructing.
You should choose <I>TEST </I>because this will invoke the editor for the
multiple choice questions. You can click to see the other options and read
about them in the help on line.
<BR><B>Name:</B> This is the name that will appear in the assignment box
for students to choose. It should be descriptive of the contents of the
assignment (e.g., I named mine <I>Idiom MC7</I> for the&nbsp; seventh version
of the multiple choice idiom test).
<BR><B>Initial URL:</B> If you are constructing an episode through the
<I>ClassNet</I> editor (as we are today), you&nbsp; should leave this blank.
<I>ClassNet</I> will take care of remembering where it puts the&nbsp; multiple
choice test that you enter.</UL>
After you have chosen the <B>Type</B> and entered a <B>Name</B>, click
on <B>Add</B>. <I>ClassNet</I> adds your assignment to the list of options
that you can work with and returns you to the <B>Assignment Menu</B>. At
this point, there is nothing in your assignment, and if your student were
to sign on to your class she would not see this assignment listed in the
<B>Student Menu</B>. It is placed in the <B>Instructor Menu</B> so that
you can work with it by choosing <B>Edit</B>.
<H5>
<A NAME="enter"></A><FONT COLOR="#000099">Entering your multiple choice
questions</FONT></H5>
On the <B>Assignment Menu</B> page, choose the assignment name (e.g., Idiom
MC7), and then click on <B>Edit</B>. This will take you to a two-frame
editor. The left frame is like a table of contents that will list the parts
comprising your multiple choice test file. For example, when I began the
multiple choice test, the list in the left would appear as it does below,
including the name I had given the test (<B>Idiom MC7</B>), the <B>new
block</B> and <B>1.1</B> where the first question would be added.
<UL><B>Idiom MC7</B>
<BR><B>1 new block</B>
<BR><B>1.1</B></UL>
As you edit, you choose parts of the file that you want to work on. The
right-hand side will produce editors for the various parts as you are working.

<P>Begin by choosing (clicking on) <B>1 new block</B>. A block is a segment
within the episode you are constructing. For the multiple choice test you
are writing, you will need to put one question within each block. Actually
the block is defined in a way that it will choose one question from each
block each time the test is done, but since you only have 3 or 4 questions
and you want them all to appear on the test, you need to place each one
in its own block.

<P>After you have highlighted 1 new block, click on <B>Edit</B>, and the
block editor will appear in the right frame. The block editor allows you
to specify the name of the block, number of points for each question in
the block, and some prefacing documentation. You should change the name
of the block from <B>new block</B>, to something more descriptive like
<I>block one</I> (because you will put the first question in this block).
Leave the points as<B> 1</B> (partial 0). You don’t need to put anything
in the <B>Preface </B>section. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and
click on <B>Save</B> to save your new block name. The block name in the
list on the left will not change immediately even though the change has
been made.

<P>Next click on the <B>1.1</B> on the left, and then click on <B>Edit</B>.
This will cause the question editor to appear in the right frame. The question
editor allows you to enter three types of information: the type of question,
the correct answer to the question, and the text of the question that the
student will see.
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><B>Type:</B> You can click on this and see the various options, but
since we are creating a multiple choice question, you should leave the
question type as <B>CHOICE</B>.
<BR><B>Answer:</B> You should indicate the correct answer for the question
that you are going to enter. Use a number (1, 2, 3, or 4) to refer to the
alternatives you will enter.
<BR><B>Question Text:</B> Enter the text of your first question in this
box. The form of the question should be as the example below indicates.
Notice that you do not include a number&nbsp; with the question (<I>ClassNet</I>
will add that). Notice also that there are some additional codes which
are needed to indicate to <I>ClassNet</I> where the alternatives are in
the text you are entering. The &lt;BR> code is the familiar HTML code&nbsp;
indicating a line break.</UL>

</TABLE></CENTER>
&nbsp;

<P>When you have entered the question text in the <B>Question Text</B>
box, you should click on <B>Save.</B>

<P>To create your second question, you need to create a new block so you
can go through the same process. To create a new block, highlight the name
of your test (e.g., <I>Idiom MC7</I>), and then click on <B>Add</B>. <I>ClassNet
</I>will add to the list so it looks as follows:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL><B>Idiom MC7</B>
<BR><B>1 new block</B>
<BR><B>1.1</B>
<BR><B>2. new block</B>
<BR><B>2.1</B></UL>
You can now repeat the process you used to create the first item to create
a second one, third one, and so on.
<H5>
<A NAME="publish"></A><FONT COLOR="#000099">Publishing your questions as
an "Assignment" in ClassNet</FONT></H5>
After you finish entering your questions, you need to "publish" them so
the name of your test will appear in the <B>Student Menu</B> when your
students sign on to <I>ClassNet</I>. To publish, click on the name of your
test in the list on the left. The editor that appears on the right includes
the option to publish the test. Change nothing on this page except for
checking <B>Publish</B>, and then <B>Save</B>. You should be ready to have
your students try out the test.
<H5>
<A NAME="try"></A><FONT COLOR="#000099">Trying out your questions with
"students"</FONT></H5>
To see how your test will work for your students, you should sign on to
your class as another person--this time a student. You can make up a name
and password. On the <B>Student Menu</B>, you will see your test name listed.
You should highlight that and then choose <B>Complete</B> to try out your
test. When you have done it, get at least one other person in class to
sign on to your class as a student to do your test. Finally, e-mail me
your <I>class</I> name so I can sign on and try it.
<H5>
<A NAME="work"></A><FONT COLOR="#000099">Working with <I>ClassNet </I>more</FONT></H5>
If you want to change your multiple choice questions after you have published
your test, you can make the changes by using the editor in the same way
that you did before.

<P>If you want to see the file that the <I>ClassNet</I> editor creates,
you can choose <B>Mail</B> from the <B>Instructor Menu</B> (after you have
chosen your test name from the menu). It is a file that contains a mix
of HTML and <I>ClassNet</I> tags. The file used to present the <I>Idiom
MC7</I> test in listed on the following page. If you understand the tags
to some degree, you can edit multiple choice tests in a text editor, place
them in your WWW directory on Vincent. Then when you <B>Add</B> from the
<B>Assignment Menu</B>, you will specify the URL where your new multiple
choice test is located, rather than leaving the URL blank as you did when
you were editing in <I>ClassNet</I>.

<P>You can follow this same process to work with the other types of episodes:
Use the editor to create an example, e-mail the example to yourself, look
at the <I>ClassNet</I> codes, create other files using those codes, place
them in your WWW directory, and then <B>Add</B> them using their URLs from
the <B>Assignment Menu</B>.
