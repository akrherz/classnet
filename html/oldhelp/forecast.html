Forecast Help</H3></CENTER>

A forecast acts just like a test. It consists of CHOICE, BLANK, OPTION
and MULTIPLE questions. Students complete a forecast assignment and submit
it for grading. However, each day, the students can submit a new forecast.
In addition, the data for the forecast answers are based on the previous
day's weather.

<P><B>To create a forecast</B>, add an assignment, name it and make it
a <B>FORECAST</B>. This process will create a set of test items asking
about the pertinent information associated with a forecast. You may delete
any questions which are not pertinent to your class. You may also limit
the number of reporting sites by editing item 1. <I>Do not delete or move
item 1 or the forecast will fail. </I>You may also add other questions
if you so desire.

<P>When your editing is complete, be sure to edit the forecast assignment
(the name at the top), click on the <B>Publish</B> checkbox and <B>Save</B>.
This will make the forecast available to students.

You will note that some of the answers use the notation {WIND_DIR_12}.
This means that ClassNet will replace this symbol and the brackets with
the correct value for the date and site of the forecast when the forecast
is graded. These names currently include:
<UL>
<LI>
WIND_DIR_0 - wind direction (N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW) at midnight. Acceptable
answers may be within 45 degrees of true wind direction. For example, if
the wind is</LI>

<BR>from the north, NW,N and NE would all be acceptable.
<LI>
WIND_SPEED_0 - wind speed in knots at midnight (+- 3 knots)</LI>

<LI>
TEMP_0 - temperature in Fahrenheit at midnight (+- 5 degrees)</LI>

<LI>
DEWP_0 - dew point temperature in Fahrenheit at midnight (+- 5 degrees)</LI>
</UL>
Similar values are available for 6AM, 12PM and 6PM (i.e. 6,12 or 18 after
name). In addition,
<UL>

<LI>
RAD_COOLING - 1 if cloud cover to inhibit radiational cooling will be significant,
2 if not</LI>

<LI>
FAVOR_PRECIP - factors favoring precipitation may include:</LI>
