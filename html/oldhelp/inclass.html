An inclass assignment allows you to enter scores for student from inclass
tests or other assignments. These scores will be reported along with other
scores managed by ClassNet.

<P><B>To create an inclass assignment</B>, add an assignment, name it and
make it an <B>INCLASS</B> assignment.
<CENTER>
<H3>
Initial URL</H3></CENTER>
You can read scores from a file. Here's how:
<OL>
<LI>
The file should consist of lines in the following format:</LI>
</OL>

<PRE>Last First&nbsp; ....other information...&nbsp; Score</PRE>

<OL>Example:</OL>

<PRE>Jones Mary J.&nbsp;&nbsp; 111111111 35
Miller George&nbsp;&nbsp; 030200202 22</PRE>
ClassNet only uses the first name, last name and the score, ignoring other
information.
<OL>
<LI>
Put the file in a Web directory.</LI>

<LI>
When you add the assignment, specify this file name in the Initial URL
field. Example: http://www.public.iastate.edu/~cs403/exam1.dat</LI>

<LI>
ClassNet will read this file and respond with a form consisting of the
score each student received on the test, a list of students who didn't
receive a score and a list of lines in your file which could not be matched
with a student name. In the latter two cases, you can manually enter the
scores. You can also set the maximum number of points for the test.</LI>

<LI>
Submit this form to store the scores.</LI>

<LI>
Move the file out of the Web directory to keep others from reading it.</LI>
</OL>

<CENTER><B>Note</B></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>It is possible to create a Web directory which is password-protected.
This would be a good place to store your files. See your local Webmaster
for details.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>To make the scores visible to students, edit the assignment and click
on the <B>Publish</B> checkbox and <B>Save</B>. You may also change the
maximum score for the assignment.
