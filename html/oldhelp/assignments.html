Assignment Types</H4></CENTER>
ClassNet is designed to support a growing list of assignment types. For
example, a TEST is a multi-question test consisting of multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank or essay questions. A FORECAST is a test which requests
tomorrow's weather data for a site in the U.S.

<P>When students submit this test, ClassNet will grade it according to
the answers you have given. Future types of assignments may be SURVEYS
(i.e. ungraded tests), PORTFOLIO entries (i.e. files created by students)
or even the output of programs. If you have suggestions for assignments
which meet your needs, let us know.

Publishing</H4></CENTER>
When an assignment is initially created, it is <B>unpublished </B>which
means that students will not see it on their assignment menu. Using the
<B>Edit</B> option, you can supply the necessary information for the assignment.
When it is ready for use, select the <B>Publish</B> option to make it available
to students.
