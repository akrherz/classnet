Assignments are typically multiple-choice tests, essay tests, surveys or
hand-graded assignments. Tests are automatically scored by ClassNet while
other types of assignments are graded by the instructor and the scores
entered into ClassNet manually. The Gradebook can be used to display the
score and answer information.
