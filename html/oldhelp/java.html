A java assignment is a more complicated assignment that allows one to store
java simulation data. This allows instructors and researchers to analyze
how students are working with simulations. This type of an assignment involves
designing a java applet which interacts with a second data server running
on ClassNet's end. This assignment is proving to be a powerful assignment
type for simulation research and needs to be developed in consultation
with ClassNet administrators.

<P>&nbsp;<B>However</B>, one can create a simple java assignment that does
not store data in ClassNet and does not involve consultation with ClassNet
administrators. By following the directions below, one can give students
private access to an assignment inside ClassNet containing a Java applet.
<CENTER>
<H3>
Assignment Creation</H3></CENTER>
Using your favorite HTML editor, create an assignment file consisting of
html text and a java applet.
<CENTER>
<H3>
Placing the Assignment into Classnet</H3></CENTER>

<OL>
<LI>
Put the html file and java class(es) into a Web directory.</LI>

<LI>
Go to the Instructor <B>Assignments</B> menu, and click <B>Add</B>.</LI>

<LI>
Select Type: <B>Java</B> and give it a name. This name must be the same
name as the html file without the html extension. For example if the html
file in the first step is called java1.html, then the assignment must be
named java1. Currently, spaces are not allowed in java assignment names.</LI>

<BR>For Initial URL, specify the Web directory where you put the assignment
in the first step above.
<BR>(e.g. http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mvg/java1.html)
<LI>
Click <B>Add</B>, and ClassNet will read this file and attempt to store
it within ClassNet. If the assignment was stored correctly, you will be
presented with an updated <B>Assignments</B> Menu.</LI>

<LI>
To load the java applet classes, again click on <B>Add</B> in the <B>Assignments</B>
Menu. Select Type: <B>Java</B> and give it the assignment name used (e.g.
java1). Then, in Initial URL, specify where the applet class is. (e.g.
http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mvg/java1.class).</LI>

<BR>Repeat this step for additional classes.
<LI>
If you wish to make this assignment immediately available to the students,
select the assignment name and click <B>Edit</B> in the <B>Assignments</B>
Menu. In the form you receive, click the <B>Publish</B> checkbox and then
press <B>Save</B>.</LI>
</OL>

<CENTER><B>Notes</B></CENTER>
Even storing a simple java assignment within ClassNet is a more detailed
process than the other assignment types. Please contact ClassNet administrators
with any questions.
<BR>One of the quickest ways to store the classes is to create a single
archive by <B>zip</B>ping the classes with no compression into one .zip
file.
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>An example session</B></CENTER>
<A HREF="LessonGraph.txt">LessonGraph </A>is an example java assignment
html file that uses a zip file. Note that LinearLesson.class is actually
stored within LessonGraph.zip. After loading LessonGraph.html, one would
only need to add in LessonGraph.zip

<P>&nbsp;Example Steps I used
<OL>
<LI>
I put the LessonGraph.zip and LessonGraph.html files into my web readable
directory at Iowa State. This directory is accessible by the URL http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mvg</LI>

<LI>
Logged into my class as Instructor and went to the <B>Assignments</B> menu
where I clicked on <B>Add</B></LI>

<LI>
Type: Java</LI>

<BR>Name: LessonGraph
<BR>Initial URL: http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mvg/LessonGraph.html
<BR>Clicked <B>Add</B>
<LI>
Clicked on <B>Add</B> in the <B>Assignments</B> Menu</LI>

<LI>
Type: Java</LI>

<BR>Name: LessonGraph
<BR>Initial URL: http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mvg/LessonGraph.zip
<BR>Clicked <B>Add</B>
<LI>
Selected "LessonGraph" Clicked on <B>Edit</B> in the <B>Assignments</B>
Menu</LI>

<LI>
Clicked the <B>Publish</B> checkbox and clicked on <B>Save</B></LI>
</OL>
The assignment was now available to my students.
