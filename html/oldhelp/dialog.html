A dialog assignment allows for private, ongoing, asynchronous conversations
between instructors and students. This helps alleviate the problem of students
not having email addresses and provides the instructor/researcher with
a means of organizing and storing conversations. These conversations are
stored by ClassNet and thus can be analyzed and synthesized for research
purposes at a later date. This assignment is ideal for students in areas
such as teacher education and counselor education who wish to hold practice
conversations with secondary/elementary students/clients.

Assignment Creation</H3></CENTER>
Using your favorite HTML editor, create an assignment file consisting only
of html text and textareas. For example, one could create a picture with
a textarea below it. A teacher could then work with a student to create
a story about the picture within the textarea. Another example would be
a counselor creating various problem situations. Then, by associating a
textarea with each situation, the counselor can have an ongoing private
dialog with the student about each situation.
<BR><B>Please note that only form textareas are used and all HTML references
must contain the full URL (e.g. src="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mvg/images/image.gif")</B>
