<UL>
<LI>
<B><A HREF="edit_test.html">TEST</A></B> - A test is a series of multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank and essay questions. The questions can be randomly selected
or random versions of tests can be administered. When students submit their
answers, the multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions are automatically
graded. The instructor may then edit the student answers to grade and comment
on the essay questions.</LI>

<LI>
<B><A HREF="forecast.html">FORECAST</A></B> - A forecast is a test which
requests information about tomorrow's expected weather at different sites
in the U.S. Students may complete a forecast on a daily basis.</LI>

<LI>
<B><A HREF="inclass.html">INCLASS</A></B> - An in-class assignment provides
the ability to record scores from tests or assignments which are administered
outside of ClassNet. Instructors can create inclass assignments and enter
scores for students. These scores will be reported along with the other
assignment types.</LI>

<LI>
<B><A HREF="edit_test.html">EVAL</A></B> - A student evaluation form is
a test with a due date. Students may enter and edit their answers until
the due date like a test. Instructors may view summary results after the
due date but cannot view individual student responses by student name.
Essay responses may be viewed by using the Data option to view the raw
data.</LI>

<LI>
<B><A HREF="dialog.html">DIALOG</A></B> - A dialog assignment allows for
private, ongoing, asynchronous conversations between instructors and students.
These conversations are stored by ClassNet and thus can be analyzed and
synthesized for research purposes at a later date. This assignment is ideal
for students in areas such as teacher education and counselor education
who wish to hold practice conversations with secondary/elementary students/clients.</LI>

<LI>
<B><A HREF="java.html">JAVA</A></B> - A java assignment is a more complicated
assignment that allows one to store java simulation data. This allows instructors
and researchers to analyze how students are working with simulations. This
type of an assignment involves designing a java applet which interacts
with a second data server running on ClassNet's end. This assignment is
proving to be a powerful assignment type for simulation research and needs
to be developed in consultation with ClassNet administrators. <B>However</B>,
one can create a simple java assignment that does not store data in ClassNet
and does not involve consultation with ClassNet administrators. Thus, students
can be given private access to an assignment inside ClassNet containing
a Java applet.</LI>
