<P><HR SIZE="4">A test consists of a list of blocks. Within each block is
a list of questions. Blocks and questions are called <STRONG>sections</STRONG>.
The Test editor will allow you to add, delete and edit assignment, block
and question values.<BR>
<BR>
Once you have published an assignment, students can complete it. When they
request to complete an assignment, ClassNet will read all your assignment
information and generate a test.<BR>
Students will then provide the answers and submit the test to ClassNet for
grading.

<H4><CENTER>Editing an Assignment</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
Click on the assignment name (the first name in the list) and click on edit
in the left frame. In a few seconds, your editing options for the assignment
will appear at the right:<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Question Selection</STRONG> - you can choose to randomly select
from the questions in each block or randomly select a version of the test.
ClassNet creates versions by selecting all the first questions, all the
second questions etc.
<H4><CENTER>Student Answer Options</CENTER>
</H4>
You may require that student answer all questions. Requiring answers is
appropriate for a test but may not be for a survey. When a student submits
a test which requires answers, he or she will be asked to supply all answers
before the test is accepted for grading.<BR>
<BR>
You may also allow students to see the answers to the test along with their
answers after the due date.
<H4><CENTER>Due Date</CENTER>
</H4>
If you don't specify a due date, the assignment will be accepted at any
time. If you do, no assignments will be accepted after the due date. You
can supply just the date (e.g. 09/11/1996<BR>
which is September 11, 1996) or you can include the hour and minute (e.g.
13:30:09/11/1996 \<BR>
which is 1:30PM on the same day). Note that the hour is based on a 24 hour
clock. <BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Proctor Password</B></CENTER>
<P>If you specify a proctor password, the student will not be able to complete
this assignment until the password is entered. When the student clicks on
the <B>Complete</B> button in the Student menu, the password will be requested.
If it is correct, the assignment will be displayed. If no password is supplied,
the assignment will be displayed immediately.
<H4><CENTER>Publish</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
While you are editing an assignment it remains inaccessible to students.
Once it is published, students can complete it. To publish or unpublish
an assignment, select the appropriate value in the checkbox and <STRONG>Save</STRONG>.
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor163559"></A>Blocks</CENTER>
</H3>
Give your blocks descriptive names to distinguish them in the editor. The
block name is not seen<BR>
by the student.<BR>
<BR>
You can specify the total points for this block (default 1). Total points
apply to any question presented in the block and are awarded if the answer
is correct. The total points on the test are the sum of the total points
of the blocks.You may also specify partial points for students completing
the question even if it is wrong. <BR>
Prior to the presentation of the question in the block, you may preface
the question with any other text you desire by typing it in the preface.
This text may include HTML tags which will allow you to present graphics,
video, audio, music or even simulations in your questions.
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="anchor164944"></A>Questions</CENTER>
</H3>
Your question can be one of several types:
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>CHOICE</STRONG> - a typical multiple-choice question. The
student can supply one of several answers. To create, select the CHOICE
type and enter your question text. Before each choice, enter the &lt;?&gt;
symbol. When the student sees the question, a radio button will replace
this symbol. For the answer, specify the number of the choice which is correct.
ClassNet will automatically grade these answers. <BR>

&lt;BR&gt;&lt;?&gt;LISTING
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;?&gt;NOTHING</PRE>
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Note</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>The &lt;BR&gt; symbol is HTML for a line break and causes each answer
to appear on<BR>
a new line. Without the symbol, the answers would appear on the same line.
You may intersperse HTML commands in your text to control the format. All
questions<BR>
will begin with a new paragraph and end with a horizontal rule.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>BLANK</STRONG> - a typical fill-in-the-blank question. Select
the BLANK type and enter your question text, delimiting your blank by &lt;?&gt;.....&lt;/?&gt;
delimiters (one line only). The blank will be the size of the blank you
specify and any text between the delimiters will be the initial value of
the blank. You may have multiple blanks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Example</STRONG>
</UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>The type of question which requires a student
answer is &lt;?&gt;name...&lt;/?&gt;.</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>For the answer, type it in the answer editor and specify the judging
options below as needed. Separate answers by commas for multiple blanks.
Alternate answers are separated using the '|' symbol. ClassNet will automatically
grade these answers. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Example<BR>
<BR>
</STRONG><CODE>choice | option, blank | essay<BR>
<BR>
</CODE>This would provide the answers for two blanks. The answer for the
first blank would<BR>
be either choice or option. The answer for the second blank would be blank
or essay.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>ESSAY</STRONG> - a text editor in which students can enter
free-form answers. Select the ESSAY type and type in your text. Delimit
the text editor using &lt;?&gt;....&lt;/?&gt; . These may extend over multiple
lines. Any text between the delimiters will be the initial value of the
editor. Specify the size of the editor in the Essay Editor Size fields.
The answer must be manually graded. <BR>

  <LI><STRONG>LIKERT</STRONG> - a multiple-choice question which generally
represents a scale from one extreme to another. Likert scales are specified
like CHOICE questions. However, since there is no<BR>
right answer, a score is generated based on the answer selected. By default,
the score is based on the order of the answer chosen. The first answer would
be scored 1, the second 2, etc. Weights can be specified in the answer field
if another scoring scheme is desired. The<BR>
weights should be numbers (plus or minus) separated by commas.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Example<BR>
Answer: </STRONG>5,4,3,2,1

<PRE>Your view of computers is:
&lt;?&gt;Very unfavorable &lt;?&gt;Unfavorable &lt;?&gt;Neutral  &lt;?&gt;Favorable &lt;?&gt;Very Favorable</PRE>

scored.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Feedback</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
You can supply feedback for this question which will be displayed when the
student views the answer (if you allow it). This would be a good place to
put links to relevant information for<BR>
this question.
<H4><CENTER>Blank Judging Options</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
To grade a Blank question, ClassNet compares the correct answer with the
student answer. You can control this judging process by using the following
options:
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>Numeric</STRONG> - treat the answer as a number and compare
it numerically. Your answer can be a value like 3.14 or a range like -5.00:10.33.
If Numeric is selected, all of the following options are ignored.
  <LI><STRONG>Textual</STRONG> - a text comparison will be made. This comparison
is controlled by the following options:
  <LI><STRONG>Exact</STRONG> - the comparison is letter for letter. All
the remaining judging options are ignored. If not selected, the following
options are enforced if selected:
  <LI><STRONG>Capitalization</STRONG> - 'a' and 'A' will be considered different
  <LI><STRONG>Spelling</STRONG> - words must be spelled exactly as in the
answer. Otherwise, words that are &quot;close&quot; are accepted as the
same.
  <LI><STRONG>Punctuation</STRONG> - enforce the same punctuation as in
the answer. Normally, punctuation is ignored.
  <LI><STRONG>Word Order </STRONG>- if the order of words in the answer
is important, select this option.
  <LI><STRONG>Word Count</STRONG> - if you are only looking for a specified
number of words in the answer select this option. Otherwise, extra words
will be allowed.
