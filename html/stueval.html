<P>Presenting information via the Web, whether it be text, audio, video
or other media is only part of the instructional process. &nbsp;Students
also need to be given assignments and evaluated on their performance. &nbsp;A
great deal of attention has been paid to information delivery. &nbsp;Much
less attention has been devoted to developing ways to evaluate students.
&nbsp;Furthermore, assessment exercises should also be learning tools.
&nbsp;See the <A HREF="http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses/">National
Science Education Standards</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/nses/html/overview.html#assessment">Assessment
chapter</A>. </P>

<P>This page is intended to present some existing alternatives we have
used to present and evaluate assignments on the Web. &nbsp;Since evaluation
on the Web is in its infancy, please view the examples as suggestive rather
than exhaustive. </P>

<P>As we look at different evaluation instruments, we need to be aware
of what that instrument can realistically evaluate. &nbsp;While multiple-choice
tests are a mainstay of many courses and are easy to construct and grade,
their ability to evaluate higher levels of thinking is low. &nbsp;Below
is a table of some evaluation types and thinking levels (<A HREF="http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~orono/collaborative/bloom.html">from
Bloom's taxonomy</A>) </P>

<P>Some have said you get what you test. &nbsp;Would you agree? </P>

<P>Education has been criticized for producing students who know isolated
facts but can't apply their knowledge to realistic situations. &nbsp;Can
we use the Web to remedy that situation? </P>

<P>At Iowa State, we have several tools which can help support the evaluation
types described above. &nbsp;We hope that these examples motivate you to
come up with new types which will foster higher levels of thinking &nbsp;for
students. </P>

<H4>Global Change Course </H4>

<P>The Global Change Course at Iowa State as implemented an electronic
portfolio for evaluating student progress. Defined, a portfolio is a &quot;representative
and judicious collection of the student's work.&quot; The student portfolio
for this course has two fundamental purposes: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Provides a documentation of the student's work, and </LI>

<LI>Serves as the basis for evaluating the student's work based upon given
standards. </LI>
</OL>

<P>The benefits of the portfolio include: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Providing the student with criteria to be used in judging their work.
</LI>

<LI>Providing the student with direct evidence of their work. </LI>

<LI>Providing the student with a chance for self-analysis and reflection.
</LI>

<LI>Serving as a form of &quot;electronic publishing.&quot; </LI>
</OL>

<P>You are welcome to explore some of the features of the <A HREF="http://www.iitap.iastate.edu/gcp/portfolio/cover_page.html">Global
Change Course Electronic Portfolio</A> which include both student and instructor
versions. Matthew T. Johnson, a recent graduate and student in the course,
has graciously offered his portfolio for you to examine. </P>

<H4>Class Management </H4>

<P>Managing assignments and scores gets more complicated as we move to
an Internet-based education system. &nbsp;Students may no longer be in
the same country, let alone the same campus. &nbsp;Time zones and student
schedules make synchronous delivery of information less viable. </P>

<P>The <B>ClassNet</B> system was designed to support the administrative
load of Internet classes. Using ClassNet, you can create a class which
students enroll themselves in, create assignments (tests, simulations,
problem sets etc.) which students complete, score the tests often automatically
and make results available any time, anywhere. </P>

<P>The best way to understand ClassNet is to use it. Here's how: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Go to <A HREF="http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/main-menu" target="ClassNet">ClassNet</A>
</LI>

<LI>Click on <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Enroll as a Student</FONT> on the Main
Menu </LI>

<LI>Specify the class name <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Education Workshop</FONT>
and give the requested information. </LI>

<LI>Click on <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Enroll</FONT></B> </LI>

<LI>Login to the class </LI>

<LI>Complete each of the assignments listed: </LI>
</OL>

<UL>
<LI><B>A Problem Set </B>- This is an example of a self-test consisting
of a number of different types of questions. &nbsp;Click on <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">A
Problem Set</FONT> and <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Complete</FONT></B>. </LI>

<OL>
<LI>Fill in the answers and <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Submit</FONT></B>
the test. </LI>

<LI>Click on <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Answers</FONT></B>. &nbsp;How did
you do? </LI>

<LI>Click on <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Back</FONT></B> and then <B><FONT COLOR="#008000">Scores</FONT></B>.
&nbsp;Students can view their current scores at any time from anywhere.
</LI>
</OL>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>Forecasting </B>- Complete the forecast. &nbsp;Note that a forecast
is like the problem set in which the answers change daily. &nbsp;Come back
tomorrow to see how you did. </LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<P><B>Mountain</B> - Assignments can be anything which can be shown on
a Web page. &nbsp;Try out this Java simulation. &nbsp;We can build in the
capabilities to save the student attempts and replay them.<BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P>Finally, see ClassNet from the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Instructor</FONT>'s
point of view:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Go to the ClassNet Main Menu</LI>

<LI>Select <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Education Workshop</FONT></LI>

<LI>Select &quot;Pete Boysen&quot;</LI>

<LI>Enter password &quot;java&quot;</LI>

<LI>Try the various menu options but please don't change anything!</LI>
