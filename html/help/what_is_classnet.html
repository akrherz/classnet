<h3 align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How does ClassNet 
  work?</font></h3>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The process begins when 
  an instructor accesses ClassNet at: <strong><a
href="http://classnet.geol.iastate.edu">http://classnet.geol.iastate.edu/</a> </strong>and 
  creates a class. Once the class is ready, students may enroll. (Please note: 
  Enrolling with the ClassNet system is a separate process from registering with 
  the governing institution.) </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon enrolling, students 
  may:<br>
  --Complete tests and assignments</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  --View grades<br>
  --Communicate with classmates and the instructor<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instructors may access ClassNet to 
  create tests, update class information, change student passwords, and communicate 
  with students. Tests may contain multiple-choice, short-answer and essay questions. 
  Grading is automated and occurs after the due date assigned to the test. If 
  no due date is provided, tests will be graded immediately upon submission. Answers 
  to essay questions are e-mailed to the instructor. While student grades are 
  stored on the ClassNet server, course content is stored on the instructor's 
  Web site, and is accessed by students through URLs provided by the instructor. 
  Links in the class content can route students directly to the ClassNet Main 
  Menu for assignments and testing.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do I start?</font></h3>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are an instructor, 
  click on <b>Create</b> on the ClassNet Main Menu and supply the requested information. 
  This information will be sent to the ClassNet administrators for completion, 
  which will occur within one working day. Once you receive confirmation via e-mail, 
  your class will be listed with the available classes on the ClassNet Main Menu, 
  and you can login and begin to make assignments. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Students may enroll 
  in the class by locating and selecting the class name and then clicking on <b>Enroll</b> 
  at the Main Menu. You may configure your class so that all enrollment requests 
  require your approval for processing, or you may allow students to enroll and 
  automatically be added to the class. If you chose the Approve option for your 
  class, an <b>Approve</b> button will appear on your Membership Menu when there 
  students are waiting for approval.&nbsp;You may also manually add and delete 
  students from the class.</font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Making Assignments</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ClassNet is designed to support a 
  number of assignment types, including: <br>

  To create and manage assignments, select the <b>Assignment</b> button on the 
  Instructor Menu. Your existing assignments will be listed. To add an assignment, 
  click on <b>Add </b> in the Assignment Menu and enter the name of the assignment 
  and its type and click on <b>Add</b>. The assignment will be added to a development 
  area not accessible to students. <b>Edit</b> the assignment as necessary, and

  by students until it has been published.</font>
