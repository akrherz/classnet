  <LI> <B><A HREF="edit_test.html"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">TEST</font></A></B><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
    - A test is a series of multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank and essay questions. 
    Random versions of tests can be administered, or individual questions can 
    be randomly generated. When students submit their tests, the multiple-choice 
    and fill-in-the-blank questions are automatically graded. Essay questions 
    are e-mailed to the instructor for evaluation and comment.<br>
    <br>
    </font></LI>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><A HREF="forecast.html">FORECAST</A></B> 
    - A forecast is a test which requests information about tomorrow's expected 
    weather at different sites in the U.S. Students may complete forecasts on 
    a daily basis.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><A HREF="inclass.html">INCLASS</A></B> 
    - An in-class assignment provides the ability to record scores from tests 
    or assignments which are not administered through ClassNet. Instructors create 
    an in-class assignment, and then enter student scores. These scores will be 
    reported along with the other assignment types.<br>
    <br>
    </font></LI>
  <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><A HREF="edit_test.html">EVAL</A></B> 
    - A student evaluation form is a test with a due date. Students may enter 
    and edit their answers until the due date. Instructors may view summary results 
    after the due date but cannot view individual student responses. Essay responses 
    may be viewed by using the <b>Data</b> option.<br>
    <br>
    </font></LI>
  <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><A HREF="dialog.html">DIALOG</A></B> 
    - A dialog assignment allows for private, ongoing conversations between instructors 
    and students. These conversations are stored by ClassNet, and can be analyzed 
    and synthesized for research purposes at a later date. This assignment is 
    ideal for students in areas such as teacher education and counselor education 
    who wish to hold practice conversations with secondary/elementary students/clients.<br>
    <br>
    </font></LI>
  <LI> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><A HREF="java.html">JAVA</A></B> 
    - A Java assignment is a more complicated assignment type that stores Java 
    simulation data. This allows instructors to analyze how students are working 
    with simulations. This type of assignment involves designing a Java applet 
    which interacts with a second data server. This assignment type is a powerful 
    tool, and needs to be developed with the ClassNet administrators. <B>However</B>, 
    it is possible to create a simple Java assignment that does not store data 
    on the ClassNet server. This does not require consultation with ClassNet administrators, 
    and allows students to be given access to an assignment containing a Java 
    applet.</font></LI>
