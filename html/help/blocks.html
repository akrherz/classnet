  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Block names are not 
    seen by students. Give your blocks descriptive names to more easily distinguish 
    them in the editor. <br>
    <br>
    Specify the total points for this block (default 1). Total points apply to 
    any question presented in the block and are awarded if the answer is correct. 
    The total points on the test are the sum of the total points of the blocks. 
    You may also award partial points to students completing the question, even 
    if their answer is wrong. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    You may preface the questions with any other text you desire by typing it 
    in the preface. This text may include HTML tags, which allows you to present 
    graphics, video, audio, music or even simulations in your questions. </font></p>
