<ul>
      <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Edit an Assignment:</b> 
        Click on the assignment name, and click on <b>Edit</b> in the left frame. 
        In a few seconds, your editing options for the assignment will appear 
        at the right:<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <strong>Question Selection:</strong> 
        Choose for ClassNet to randomly select from the questions in each block 
        or randomly select a version of the test. Versions are created by selecting 
        all the first questions, all the second questions etc. <br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Student Answer Options: 
        </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may require that 
        student answer all questions. If this option is selected, ClassNet will 
        not accept the test until the student has answered each question. You 
        may also allow students to see the correct answers to the test, along 
        with their answers, after the due date. Requiring answers is appropriate 
        for a test but may not be for a survey. <br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Due Date:</b></font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
        no due date is specified, the assignment will be accepted at any time. 
        If a due date is given, no assignments will be accepted after that date. 
        You can supply the date (e.g. 09/11/1998,<br>
        which is September 11, 1998) or you can include the hour and minute (e.g. 
        13:30:09/11/1998 \<br>
        which is 1:30 p.m. on the same day). Note that the hour is based on a 
        24 hour clock.<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Proctor Password: </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
        a proctor password is specified, the student will not be able to complete 
        this assignment until the password is entered. When the student clicks 
        on the <b>Complete</b> button in the Student Menu, the password will be 
        requested. If the correct password is entered, the assignment will be 
        displayed. <br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
      <li> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Publish:</b> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        While you are editing an assignment, it is inaccessible to students. Once 
        it is published, students can complete it. To publish or unpublish an 
        assignment, select the appropriate value in the checkbox and <strong>Save</strong>.
