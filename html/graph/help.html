  <h3><u>Goal</u></h3>
  Find relationships between the numerical coefficients of
  the equation (the numbers entered for the a,b,c textboxes) and the
  resulting graphed lines. How do these numbers change the graph? Do
  these numbers mean anything?<br>
  Can you discover how to use the a,b, and c coefficients to immediately
  draw a line?

  <h3><u>Goal</u></h3> To guide and encourage students in discovering the
  relationships between the numerical coefficients of the equation and the 
  resulting graphed lines. Help the students employ learning strategies
  which can be used in other problem situations.
