I saw your topic and I just wanted to tell you something. In today's (9/19/03) "The New York Tribune" there was a fantastic article about file-sharing and the recent legal and social developments surrounding it. I think it would really help you out! (If you can't find it, I can bring in a copy of mine on Tuesday). Just let me know if you find it useful! See you in class!
