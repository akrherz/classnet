===message:The question is not who is going to run against Bush, but who is going to run for the Democrats.  Who is going to be able to finish what Bush started in Iraq, by pulling our troops out, but in doing so, not destroy the very unstable government that we have placed in Iraq.  I don't know that Americans, even though they disagree with Bush, will be abel to pick a candidate from the Democratic party who theuy trust to do this.  There are also so many Democrats running, that they will end up beating each other.  Right now, Bush's campaign is waiting to publish mass amounts of ads until the Democrats choose a candidate.  They are assuming that by the time the Democrats have chosen a candidate, that candidate will have spent so much money on his/her campaign against other Democrats, that they will have very little personal money left.  Though the candidate will recieve quite a bit of money from the Democratic endorsement, it will not be enough to counter Bush's funds, and money can make a huge difference in an election.  Also, I have a feeling Bush's approval rating will improve.  Even though it has dropped since Iraq, I think it will increase again once a larger number of troops are pulled out.  I'll say Bush is going to be re-elected.
