===message:Hey, I personally think that death and the afterlife is an awesome topic!! I mean, how often do people actually think about it?(aside from your standard heaven and hell scenario). Well, I think you should go with it! You could analyze and compare different religions, scientific conclusions, and even ask agnostics and athiests what they think. Yup, I think you're on the right track. (Do I sound a little too hyper? Must be all that chocolate I stole from the career fair...)
