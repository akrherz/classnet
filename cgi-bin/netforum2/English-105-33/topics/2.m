===subject:FPT:Topic(9/16)
===message:I have chosen a topic of great interest to many.  It is of a philosophical nature, and will be about the debate over whether God exists.  I will examine different "proofs" of God's existence(St. Thomas Aquinas' proofs, the kalam(or cosmological argument), and the ontological argument) and why philosophers such as Kant and Nietzche rejected these.  I will be taking the side of the existence of God.  I will probably use the two essays about God's existence in the book, and find another one that has to do with my topic.

===subject:CA:Hack Questions 1&2 (9/16)
===message:1:Hack's "moral code" says that men and women shouldn't have sex before marriage.  This is supported by his examples of "100 ways to make love without having sex", and his stating the fact that there was a sign on the wall that said where he could pick up condoms.  ------------------->2:Hack proposed that the University should allow him to live outside of the dorms to resolve the issues of his sexual morals.  Yale refuses to accept this because the moral values that they hold the highest are social order and tolerance.  I think Yale is justified, given their moral statement.  I think if Hack believes he would be subject to falling into the people's behavior just by hanging around people that have sex, he's going to have to walk around blindfolded with earplugs to keep himself from falling into sexual immorality.  Also, under his "moral code" it's wrong no matter what people think that sex before marriage is wrong.  If you look in the first sentence of the 3 to last paragraph, you see a quote that tells us how he really feels. "We cannot, in good conscience, live in a place where women are permitted to stay overnight in men's roms, and where visiting men can traipse through the common halls on woment's floors -in various stages of undress- in the middle of the night."  This condradicts his suggested solution, because if he really believes that these things were wrong, and is amazed by how horrible people are acting, simply moving out won't help solve the problem.  It will merely help him to ignore the horrible reprobateness of today's culture.  If you can't in good conscience live in a place where wrong is happening, do something about it.  Show the people that what they're doing is wrong and that they should stop it.  He seems to be trying to hold to moral relativism and Judaism at the same time, which gives us no reason why we shouldn't make him stay in this place.  A question comes to mind: If the way you were raised is the only thing that this "moral code" of yours is, why should we allow you to follow it?  Do you really believe that it's true? you never even refer the actions you disapprove of as "wrong". You just basically say that you were raised this way, so you have to do it.  If you were raised to believe that murder is good and you should do it all the time, does that make it any less wrong?

===subject:CA:Jacoby  Questions 1&2 (9/16)
===message:1: I disagree that this article is a claim of fact.  This article uses a claim of fact to support a policy claim that the MCAS should be given.  By trying to establish that students can and do master reems of irrelavent facts the author TOTALLY totally misses the point of the argument given by SCAM.  The students are claiming that it is wrong to not allow a student to get a diploma simply because they haven't learned the reems of irrelavent facts in X category.  Also, most students learn the pop culture facts, because they LIKE the things that make up pop culture and enjoy learning more about it.  He commits a fallacy of bifurcation by saying that either the students should take the test, or they don't have the capacity to learn what's on the test.  There are other choises.  You shouldn't force the students not to graduate if they aren't good at Subject X,Y, and Z.  What if they're amazing at Subjects P,Q, and R?  Does that not count toward anything?
------------------------------------------------>2:When he says "You think the MCAS and tests like it are too difficult?", and then argues why it isn't gives a clue as to what he thinks of it.  Also in the first paragraph he talks about how the reason's that people in massechuseetts are complaining are that they "are a querulous [querulous is a long word that basically means whiney] bunch" and because the MCAS is regarded as one of the nation's tougher high school tests.  He's basically saying that they're whiners and there's a tough test, so they obviously will whine.  It's not persuasive.  It only makes dissenters angry that he's calling them whiners.  It seems to have a harsh tone, which always helps make people not listen to you.

===subject:FPT:Weekly Journal   9/18
===message:I have narrowed my topic to an analysis the kalam cosmological argument for the existence of God.  I have checked out several books on the existence of God.  They are as follows: On Proving God, by Roger Hazelton; Existence of God, by John Hick; The Non-Existence of God, by Robert R. N. Ross; St. Thomas Aquinas on the Existence of God (the Collected Papers of Joseph Owens), edited by John R. Catan; The Kalam Cosmological Argument, by William Lane Craig; and The Cosmological Argument from Plato to Leibniz, by William Lane Craig.  I have begun reading a book called "Toward a Thomistic Theory of Meaning", by Thomas Howe.  The book does an excellent job of exposing the problems with several philosophical systems.  Specifically, the book argues for Moderate Realism by examining other philosophical systems, and showing how none but moderate realism solve the problem of meaning, or even account for the meaningful communication of each view.  I hope to attend a lecture at Truth Bucket this semester on the existence of God also.  I'll probably also be reading a book on the kalam cosmological arguement written by an atheist.  That's about it for this week.

===subject:FPT:One-page list of questions  9/23
===message:<pre>Can it be proven that God exists?
Can it be show that God exists?
What was has God's existence been established?
What kind of God can be established?
What are the philosophical implications of proofs for God's existence?
What assumptions must be employed to argue for the existence of God?
What assumptions are made in rejecting the argument?
Are these assumptions realistic?
Do the arguments hold up under scrutiny?
With what level of certainty does the kalam cosmological argument establish the existence of God?
If God really does exist, what implications must that have in our lives?


the kalam is as follows:
1.Everything that begins to exist has a cause.
2.The universe began to exist.
3.The universe has a cause.

Questions:  
What philosophical support is there for premise 2?
What scientific support is there for premise 2?

Is premise 1 valid?
Do elements of quantum physics undermine the principle of existential causality(premise 1)?
Does this warrant rejection, or reformulation of the argument?
Is there any religion whose creation account supports what we know about God through the kalam cosmological argument?
If so, what are they?</pre>

===subject:CA: Goodman Q's 1-6
===message:<pre>	1: I would subtitle the first part "Why do schools grade?"  The second part I would subtitle "The competition cause by testing as it is hinders learning".  I would subtitle the third part "How abolishing grading will help students who are "lazy" to figure out what they really want to do, and how grading uselessly throws their lives away."
	2:Some are stronger than others. His last point is the strongest, because grading is causing many people to slip through the cracks that are very capable.
	3:I think he says that because if they do that, then it'll be more likely to take hold throughout the system.  It will also be respected more.
	4:He reveals his purpose in the second to last paragraph when he says, "Yet, unfortunately, if such a student is intelligent and is not sure of himself, he can be bullied into passing, and this obscures everything.  My hunch is that I am describing a common situation.  What a grim waste of young life and teacherly effort!  Such a student will retain nothing of what he has passed in.  Sometimes he must get mononucleosis to tell his story and be believed."
	5:They continue grading because they need to do so for the graduate schools and job recruiters and stuff.  He replies by saying the people that need the testing grade should give their own test.
	6:The real purpose of testing, according to Goodman, should be to facilitate the teaching of the subject to the student.  Grading makes the student, who's trying to be competetive, much more likely to cheat and fake for the sake of the grade, rather than give an accurate picture of what he knows.</pre>

===subject:CA: ad Questions 1-3 p.221  9/25
===message:<pre>1:1:The advantages of natural gas that are stressed is the fact that it burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, and you can use less, which is good for the environment too.  The butterfly is better for persuasive purposes, because it is so beautiful, and the fact that you would be protecting something so pretty makes you feel better about natural gas use.
2:The advertiser assumes that the reader wants to protect the environment, or at least harm it less in their use of fuels.  An assumption it makes also is that natural gas is the best way of protecting the environment in the heating of your home.
3:The first ad uses a complete appeal to emotions, which gives the impression that they don't have any other reasons to use oil heat, apart from the scariness of gas heat.  The ad for natural gas heat is good because they say that it is better for the environment, and it will save you money, so it's much more worth it.  It only says that natural gas burns cleaner than fossil fuels, it doesn't insult the service of the fossil fuel people.</pre>

===message:1)a:All men are created equal.  First of all there are a few things the term equal in this usage does NOT mean.  It definitely does not mean that all men were created the same in every respect.  No one is trying to claim that all people have the same abilities and would be good in the same jobs.  The word "equal" in the context of the statement means with the same value.  The word equal is used such that "all men are created equal"  means that all men are created with the same value as human beings, which has has profound implications when making laws for those men.

</p>2)b:Palestinian homeland:  Palestinian homeland has two definite connotations.  The positive connotation means the land where the Palestinians live and make there home.  The negative connotation is when you're talking from the viewpoint of someone who doesn't believe the Palestinians actually belong there.  In conversation a statement might be like the following: "The 'Palestinian homeland' is was never, and shall never be where they belong.  It is Israeli land and they should get off of it.

</p>3)agnostic and atheist:  These two terms are often confused with each other often.  They seem to both be someone who disbelieves in God.  This is not true, but before we establish what the definitions, we must actually split the words into four different beliefs.  There is hard and soft agnosticism, and hard and soft atheism.  Hard atheism is a disbelief in God, no matter how much evidence is shown for His existence.  Soft atheism is simply the lack of a belief in God, but someone who is a soft atheist should probably call themselves something like a nontheist, since "non" has less of an "anti" connotation than "a-".  A hard agnostic believes that humans cannot know anything about God.  Soft agnostics just affirm that they don't know about god.  To avoid confusion.  I believe all should acknowledge whether they are hard or soft atheists/agnostics.

</p>4)A good parent is a parent who someone who loves there child and teaches them morality.  It is the childs fault if they do something wrong, but parents need to show them what is wrong and why it's wrong.  

</p>5) post-grunge rock:  post grunge rock applies to any rock band whose musical influence has been fairly heavily influenced by the grunge movement of the early 1990's (pioneered by bands like Nirvana, Bush, and Smashing Pumpkins).  Cold, who has a recent single called stupid girl, would be considered post grunge.  So would Trapt(with the song headstrong), and the band Breaking Benjamin.  I would say those would be the most "post-grunge" bands of late, but in a sense, basically all modern rock is post-grunge.  The grunge movement heavily affected all rock music from the early 90's on.
