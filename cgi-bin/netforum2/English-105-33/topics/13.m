Pg.55, Exercise #2 and Question #3

	3. I haven’t heard much about this topic, but from what I have read, I’m kind of indifferent. As they say in the first half of the article, by law Hooks is innocent and should be able to play on the ISU football team. But in the seconded half of the article, it states that now he has a moral issue to deal with and that the school will get a bad mane and donors might tighten their purse strings. It also states that, “McCarney has the fight to determine the moral standards of conduct for his athletes, and he can dictate who he wants on the ream.” Thus, in the seconded half of the article it seems like Hooks will not have a chance to return on the ISU football team. But at the same time, I think that the situation that he was in is not in good taste with what the couches and the donors would be interested in and that this situation will be with him forever. To be honest I don’t care about sports issues that much.

Pg.85 Q# 1

1.a) Eight times.
·	If mankind had to choose between a warmer or a cooler climate, we would certainly choose the former: Humans, nearly all other animals and most plants would be better off with higher temperature.  
·	The climate models suggest, and so far the record confirms, that under global warming nighttime winter temperatures would raise the most, and daytime summer temperatures the least.
·	Most Americans prefer a warmer climate to a colder one- and that preference is justified. 
·	More people die of the cold than of the heat: more die in the winter than the summer.
·	In addition, less snow and ice would reduce transportation delays and accidents.
·	A warmer winter would cut heating costs, more that offsetting any increase in air conditioning expenses in the summer.
·	Longer growing seasons, more rainfall and higher concentrations of carbon dioxide would benefit plant growth.
·	In the pessimistic view of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Control, the costs of global warming might be a high as 1.5 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product by the end of the next century.

b) A global warming treaty.

Huck’s “College life verses my moral code” Pg.93- 95 Q’s 1&2

1.	Huck is saying that they shouldn’t have to live in dorms for the first two years, because of the “sexual” living style. It’s against their religion and their “moral code” to live in a co-ed environment. Two examples for his definition of conduct are:
a)	We’ve had years of rigorous religious teaching, and we’ve watched and learned from out parents. We can hold our own in the intellectual debate that flows naturally from exchanges during and after class. 
b)	Yale- an institution that professes to be so tolerant and open-minded – making it particularly hard for students like us to maintain our moral standards through difficult college years?
2.	The solution to the problem that he proposes is to live off campus just like married freshmen. Yale refuses to accept the solution because they have no “parental rules” and that sexual morality is a student’s own business. 
I don’t think Yale’s rules are justified for the sole fact that they shouldn’t have to compromise their religion and/or “moral beliefs”.
       
Jacoby’s “The ‘MCAS’ teems give each other” Pg. 98-100 Q’s 1& 2

1.	I think the strongest evidence in support of this claim is when Will Fitzhugh says, “Kids set truly high performance learning standards for each other” and “that a child’s future should be determined by knowing or not knowing certain dates of formulas.” He is saying that all the knowledge that they acquired in school is worth nothing when it comes to the MCAS and that it won’t matter in the future. 
2.	Some of the expressions that indicate how the author attitude about the MCAS:
a)	Especially noisy
b)	Querulous bunch
c)	Perhaps 
d)	The question on the table is whether the subjects to be memorized will include English, math, science, and history- or weather the only mandatory subjects will be music, television, movies, and fashion.
I only think it is persuasive to an extent. Because he uses a lot of Questions in the article to make you think what would be better on the MCAS.

“Race for the Numbers” Pg. 181- 184, Q’s #1 & 2

1.	Patterson states his claim in paragraph five, in the first sentence. 
2.	I think that the different kinds of support are equally persuasive. I think that political analysis would be the most susceptible to challenge. When it comes to political topics, you can have so many ideas, thoughts, reasons, opinions, and so forth, about each topic. Also people try to argue their own opinions with political topics all the time.   

Ad on Pg. 188, Q’s #1 & 2

1.	Some strong emotional appeal that the ad makes area the feeling safe for not just you, but for a young child, who is helpless in caring for them self’s. I don’t think that the ad is justified because it’s making the ad seam that death by gas is more common than the flue. 
2.	I would put more facts in the ad to have more of an appeal to it.

“A Proposal to Abolish Grading” Pg.206-209, Q’s 1-6

1.	Subtitles:
a)	School and institution side
b)	History
c)	Students side
d)	Will to learn
2.	Some parts are stronger than others. I think the “school side” and the “will to learn” are some of the stronger parts. Goodman does not indicate the points he wants to emphasize. 
3.	He uses the fraise “half a dozen of the prestigious universities” instead of all universities, because when you hear that someone goes to an Ivy League school, people generally assume that they have good grades.
4.	I think he reveals his proposal in the seconded paragraph, seconded sentence, “For most of the students, the competitive grade has come to be the essence.” 
5.	They continue to give grades because nothing has been done about it. Goodman replies to their objections with lots of facts.
6.	What Goodman’s idea for the real purpose of testing is what you have learned and not the grade. 

Pg.221 Q’s 1-3

1.	The advantages of natural gas this ad stress are: Helping the environment, is much cleaner than fossil fuels, can reduce natural gas use up to 30% in your home and/or business. Butterflies are not superior to plants and/or other animals as persuasive elements, it’s just that butterflies are pretty and are fragile and to use butterflies means to protect something that is fragile. 
2.	That using natural gases is better for the environment.
3.	I think the ad on pg.188 is stronger that the ad on pg.221. Granted the ad on pg.188 is negative and the ad on pg.211 is positive, this does not influence my choice. The ad on pg.188 hits more to the emotional side for a young chilled, than a butterfly.

Outline for the MCAS (pg.98)



·	What kind of material should be on the test? 
-Music, fashion, TV shows, etc.
-Math, science, reading, etc.
-Is it right to test a kid’s knowledge on fashion and TV or test kids biased on math, reading, information biased on common knowledge? 
-Kids already test each other on the hottest fashion or what happened on “Friends” last night or the latest CD to buy. 
-Are these things that apply to life.
	-Or, is memorizing dates and names in history any more irrelevant than music and so on?

Q’s #1,2,3,4 Pg.153

1.	All men are created equal. 
When saying equal in a phrase like this, I’m thinking that they mean that everyone (black, white, man, woman) are equal as in getting the same job offers, no discrimination, being able to purchase the same items for what ever. 
2.	c) Affirmative Action
In Favor: Well, this started with the whole slavery thing. 200 years of oppression and then the slow movement out of racialism from the end of slavery to now. African-American wants what the white man has taken from them and their ancestors. So the govt’ is giving African-Americans money and more of a privilege to get a job, which is basically the point of affirmative action. It’s like they are reimbursing them. 
Not in Favor: This can be divided up into 2 ways. One, you have people like the KKK who believe that the govt’ has nothing to give back to African-Americans, and we should go back to our country. Then you have people who think that affirmative action is being used and abused, also unfair to some white people. There have been situations of an African-American getting a job because of affirmative action over a white man who is well equipped for the job. 
3.	Sympathy and pity:
·	Sympathy- Mutual affection or understanding a rising from such a relationship; the sharing of another’s emotions. 
·	Pity- Sympathy or sorrow felt for the sufferings of another; show mercy; something that causes regret. 
With sympathy, you have an emotional understanding of what is happening to that person in that situation. With pity, you feel bad for that person but don’t have that emotional understanding of the situation.

“A Desensitized Society Drenched in Sleaze” Jeff Jacoby Pg.626

*If sex- and violence-drenched entertainment can desensitize me, it can desensitize anyone. (Thesis)
·	Central Park joggers get raped and beaten into comas.
·	Sixth-grades sleep around.
·	Los Angeles rioters burn down their neighborhood and murder dozens of their neighbors. 
·	The Menendez boys blow off their parents’ heads.
·	Lorena Bobbitt mutilates her husband in his sleep.
·	“Artist” sell photographs of crucifixes dunked in urine.
·	Prolife fanatics open fire on abortion clinics.
·	Daytime TV fills up with deviants.
·	The U.S. Naval Academy fills up with cheaters. 
·	The teen suicide rate goes through the roof. 
·	Or that Geto Boys’ sociopathic lyrics (“Leavin’ out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth/ Drug her back in, slam her down on the couch. / Whipped out my knife, said, ‘if you scream I’m cutting,’/ Open her legs and…”) 
·	To suggest that Snoop Doggy Dogg’s barbaric gang-rape fantasies somehow follow in the tradition of Sophocles’ tragic drama, Chaucer’s romantic poetry, or Solzhenitsyn’s moral testimony is to suggest that there is no difference between meaning and meaninglessness. 
Against: Of course, the entertainment industry accepts no responsibility for any of this. Time Warner and Hollywood indignantly reject the criticisms heaped on them in recent days. We don’t cause society’s ills, they say, we only reflect them. “If an artist wants to deal with violence or sexuality or images of darkness and horror,” said film director Clive Barker, “those are legitimate subjects for artist.”

But in the last paragraph, the last sentence he states, "The question before the house is, what about the rest of us?" and I think that he is implying the we and Hollywoos should consider doing something about it.
