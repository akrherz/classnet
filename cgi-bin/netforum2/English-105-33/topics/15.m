Diagnostic Revision

	Evaluating an argumentation paper is no easy task.  There are numerous methods one could use and more than a few hurdles to overcome in an evaluation.  Essentially an evaluation, by definition, should be a fair review of a stated point, an argument.  
	First, one must be able to look beyond his or her own personal beliefs and see the paper as a qualitative attempt to present a certain viewpoint.  Next, one must continue this objective approach to rate the quality and quantity of points and or facts.  If one is allowed to become subjective the evaluation regresses into a rating of an opinion and not the presentation of said opinion.  Personally, I hold certain beliefs that others might judges odd, improper, or unethical.  Consequently, if those people were to evaluate me from a subjective stance using their opinions my evaluation might be very negative.  Conversely, if those people held the same beliefs as myself, I might be judged favorably when my writings were undeserving of a good review.  It is this conflict of ideas or beliefs that can cause an evaluation to go askew.  Another problem that might arise could very well be not what a person writes, but rather who is writing.  If a person is evaluated based on who that person is and not on how they are presenting a point, then obvious problems arise, such as bias.  
	As you can see these are just a few of the things that come up in an evaluation.  It is my opinion then, that a successful evaluation of an argumentation paper, or any paper for that matter, is an objective review of the presentation of one’s point and not the point itself.

===subject:Hack and Jacoby Q 1 & 2
===message:Hack:
Q 1. Hack's moral code is sketchy and never clearly stated, but it seems to be against pre-marital sex. Well he doesn't offer any good examples at all except seeing a sign advocating safe sex.
<br>
Q 2. Hack proposes to be allowed to stay off campus. Now nowhere in this essay does Hack say Yale rejected his request based on it's policies.
<br>
Jacoby:
<br>
Q 1. In my opinion the best support Jacoby offers is the example of the kid that memorizes sports statistics. I believe the coalition makes a very sound arguement. The best support is probably the line about how the MCAS devalues certain types of knowledge.
<br>
Q 2. The author, before stating his side uses words like noisy and mourns in a negative connotation when descibing the other side. I think the language is persuasive because it is trying to sway you to the authors point of view before you even know what it is. Jacoby is very good at using words to sway readers.

===subject:Patterson Q 1-4, Ad Q 1-2, Q 8e 9/23
===message:<pre>Patterson:
Q1. Patterson seems to state his main claim in the first paragraph or the second to last sentance, they both seem to have merit.
Q2. Some subtitles are as follows: Whites as a Minority? Definition of Hispanic.
Q3. Inaccurate statistics could cause racial tension and fear among traditional non-extremist whites.
Q4. I believe that all Patterson's support is persuasive, but the one that would be most susceptible to challenge would have to be the political analysis. I say this because statistics and history are solid fact, and while open to interpretation are not as difficult an area to define as political analysis, which is open to vast interpretations and view points.

Ad:
Q1. This ad is appealing to emotion of fear and a sense of family. I think that it is not justified because it is making a blanket statement that seems might not apply to each gas utility company.
Q2. I would contact the company that created this ad and ask to speak with someone from advertising.

Q8e. Beauty contests are not degrading to women. They are just normal contests that certain females feel the need to enter and win. If a stereotype exists, it is because certain people, namely feminists, have certain outspoken views about what a woman should be. In this day and age we have strayed so far into what has to be politically correct that everyone seems to want to complain about something. Maybe a bit of political incorrectness is a good thing, but then again I am rambling. </pre>

===subject:Goodman Q 1-6, Ad Q 1-3, 9/25
===message:<pre>Goodman:
Q1. Current Use of Grading. Origins of Grading. Various Objections to Abolishing Grading and Rebutals.
Q2. I believe that yes certain areas of Goodman's arguement are stronger than others. The only way Goodman seems to emphasize a point is by restating it, otherwise certain points just don't seem to be emphasized.
Q3. Goodman probably makes this request knowing that if his idea for abolishing grading works at these prestigious universities then many other universities would follow in their path.
Q4. Goodman appears to come out and state the purpose of his proposal on page 208 in the first paragraph.  That entire group of details seems oriented at stating the usefullness of his proposal.
Q5. Professors continue to give grades because they argue that grading is inevitable, that graduate schools and businesses need grades to know whom to accept. Goodman replies that in that case graduate schools and businesses should test applicants. 
Q6. Testing, according to Goodman, should be used as a means of structuring. In other words testing should be used to determine what students have learned and what teachers still need to teach.

Ad:
Q1. This ad stresses the idea that natural gas is cleaner and more efficient. Butterflies are not superior, but they evocate more emotion in this case because of their visual beauty.
Q2. The advertiser assumes that the reader cares about butterflies or the environment.
Q3. I believe that the ad on page 188 is stronger in arguement, solely because negative approaches seem to generally have stronger opinions. Personally though, my choice is not influenced by negative or positive, I tend to look for content.</pre>
