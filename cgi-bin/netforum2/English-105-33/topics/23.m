===message:pp.94 

1.)	Hack’s moral code is that people shouldn’t be having sex if they aren’t married.  In addition, to stay away from the many temptations that may bring them down in life.  This was told straight out in the third paragraph.  It is made clear when he states that even single sex floors are against his Judaism views or what he was taught.  Also, when he places the question about if they can stand up against classmates who have different sexual morals than he does.
2.)	In order to solve this problem, why can’t Hack and others live off campus no matter what age they are, since it was allowed a few years ago.  It never really states why Yale refuses this solution, but they aren’t justified if they claim to be in deep respect for their history and for what their history still continues to provide.  They aren’t standing to much history if it has become a worse environment in the dorms.

pp.100

1.)	The evidence about talking with the boy who thought he couldn’t hang out with the popular crowd without first knowing so much about sports and so on.  Because these tests aren’t for adults, they should have to know the answers to the questions, but these tests are for a certain student.  These questions do assess various topics about music, math, and athletics, for if a kid knows a lot about the celebrities, they learn so much about all the different topics in school.  Adults, like I mentioned previous, shouldn’t have to know any of the questions asked, for they aren’t the ones in the growing generation.
2.)	The expressions of “Just ask the nearest teenager,” and “Yet countless teens consider that knowledge essential…,” and “What then do you make of the MCAS to which teenagers routinely subject their peers?”  All those statements in his article show, that he is standing up for the MCAS.  There isn’t wrong tests, but rather faults with tests.  These tests indeed concentrate on what will make a kid able to relate with others their age and form better relationships.  I would say that this language isn’t really persuasive, but more manipulative in a sense.  He kind of forces a person to stand up for kids, or to feel sorry for them not always being able to hang out with people because of what they don’t know about more image issues.

===subject:Diagnostic Review
===message:The basis of grading is a really tough argument to address, because there are various ideas one can possess to try and put up a fight with the other.  To a student, it seems professors don’t struggle at slapping any type of grade on a paper or assignment.  The reason I feel that it is a hard topic to address is that it is based solely on a person’s opinion, yet where the opinions agree should be like a set in stone basis.  So in order to tackle how a paper, an argument paper for this instance, should be graded, we must first define the word evaluation.  
	Evaluation is the means as to what level of performance one reaches when performing a task.  In other words it is a critical examination of basically anything, but in this case, of an argumentation paper.  Now that I have tried to clear up what evaluation really is, we need to look at various ways or guidelines to follow.  
	There are a few opinions that I always thought professors should use as kind of pin points.  The main thing they should look for is the effectiveness of the paper as a whole.  I mean they should obviously look at the grammatical quality, the layout or organization of the paper, and then look at how well the author does at convincing their side of the argument.  There are so many lengths or measures within each of these three things, but I mean to take them to a college level standard.  This college level standard is what is hard to define in that many people could have a different standard, but of course the dominating one would be the professor’s.
	A certain standard as to where a college should be at in with their English knowledge kind of brings up my next point.  Professors should take into consideration, that even in Iowa, one of the dominating educational states; English taught up through high school wasn’t the strongest.  This is solely based on my own experience.  I just didn’t seem to grow as much as I did in other subjects as I did in English.  So I feel most everyone is lacking in their English knowledge even though most were in a well academic state.  I just completed a Philosophy class at the college I previously attended and we had to write argumentation papers on various topics.  The problem I had a hard time understanding was why I received a worse grade than my friend who didn’t spend as much time working on it than I did.  I mean I poured everything I had into the papers, but still was never able to obtain higher than a B-, when I felt they were some of the best papers I have written.  With this example, I think a college professor should realize that some students just have a hard time with the subject and that because of that, they shouldn’t necessarily be ripped on with a bad grade, but should be given a grade as to the level which they seem to be at.  This is a weak argument when it comes to the ideas of grades.
	Grades are there to give students an idea on how much they need to improve or how much harder they need to work at it.  If we were all given A’s, nobody would want to do anything anymore because they are just able to breeze through a higher education.  For this case, professor’s should put the grade they feel that person really did obtain and shouldn’t really care about much else, for they are letting that student know basically how much work they have to put in, in order to succeed at a certain college standard or level.
	Up to this point, we have gone through that argumentation papers should be graded on the overall effectiveness of the paper in the areas of grammar, organization or layout, and the convincing ability of the paper based on some sort of standard.  The standard after arguing kind of a student’s side and a professor’s or more common sense side, makes me come to a conclusion that in the end, it is up to the professor.  If the students would try and determine the standard or the way a paper should be evaluated, they would most always choose the way that makes it easier on them, but it rather should be the way that makes it more challenging in order to learn.  If everything in life was easy, then what’s the point of higher education?  So I feel it is up to the professors and up to the professors alone.

===subject:CA:  Patterson Q.1-4/ Metropolitan Ad Q.1-2/ Q.8e
===message:Patterson’s “Race by Numbers” Questions :

1.)	I would say he makes his claim at the end of the article.  He states that “we should stop obsessing on race in interpreting the census results.”  I would say that is his main point or claim of the article.  That too many people try to predict or alter the different races, when they should just keep the facts straight.  
2.)	Subtitles such as What Liberals Claim, A True Census Bureau Policy, Other Research Has Shown, and Some People Claim, could all be kind of subtitles throughout the article.  They are basically where he goes to show more evidence on the issue.
3.)	The danger is within not correctly stating the White race population.  It isn’t correct at all to state that the Whites are starting to become a minority.  Just isn’t a good idea.
4.)	I think they are all equally persuasive, except the statistics seem to most susceptible to change.  The statistics can change when people don’t state their correct race, which was stated in the article as well.

Page 188 Q 1,2

1.)	It’s an emotional appeal that tries to show discomfort or scared.  This is in order for them to want to feel safe when their home is heated.  Yes, it is justified by the statement of that’s what scares me.
2.)	I would verify it by the statement and the facial expressions in the picture.  They indeed match up.

Stereotypical Choice: Page 193
	8e.  I think that is partly both false and true.  It is degrading to the women who aren’t doing it or the ones who don’t win, but for those who have an interest in it, it shouldn’t be degrading to them.  It is a statement that is basically an opinionated statement.  Some will indeed agree and some will disagree, but I don’t think there is any true evidence out there, that it degrades women.  The only women would be the ones who aren’t in that good of shape or that beautiful.

===message:Goodman's "A Proposal to Abolish Grading"  1.) I would subtitle the parts into...The History of Grading, The degrading of students by pointing out their weaknesses, Laziness among students, and Ones who want to try get weeded out because of Grades.  2.) I would say some are stronger than others, but it basically states which ones are the most important.  He shows this in the second to last paragraph where he states...Most important of all, which is that balking in doing the work among most bright students goes on.  3.) I would say he calls on half a dozen of the prestigious because those are the hardest to get into and if someone graduates from their, it is their College name that gets them the job.  So basically because they are so highly sought after and tough to enter.  4.) I would say the purpose is shown in the second paragraph where he states that the competitive grade has come to be the essence.  So in order for it not to effect students to hard, they should abolish grading.  5.) One of the reasons stated in the text of why teachers still grade is because they try to goad or threaten the students who are lazy.  Goodman attacks this by some students are lazy for the fact that they don't want to try something when they are down about being graded, but people will be fired in their job because of laziness.  6.) The real purpose of testing should be entirely for pedagogic purposes as teachers see fit.  Nullifying the various uses of testing is to see what is blank or wrong, so in order to get the teacher and the student on the same page as to what they are learning and the way the teacher is teaching.

===message:Page 221 Ad Questions 1-3:  1.) The advantages that this ad stresses about natural gas is that it won't destory the environment, as well as being cleaner than fossil fuels.  Butterflies aren't superior in any way than other animals, but they are something that people think are pretty or a positive site to see in the environment, where if they don't use natural gas, they could disappear.  2.) An assumption is that everyone is facinated with the beauty of the environment and that everyone doesn't want to see it destroyed or not as pretty anymore.  3.) I would say the one on page 188 is stronger, just for the sake of people being in the ad, makes you relate or feel for the people more than the butterflies.  I would say the negative influences you the most because it makes you actually think about it more or be concerned because stuff has happened because of that before, where there are still pleanty of butterflies.
