===subject:CA: Hack 1&2 9/9
===message:1. Hack's moral code appears to be that he doesn't wish to be exposed to anything related to sexuality before marriage.  Even living in a same sex dorm, he believes he will still be presented with situations contrary to his morals and beliefs on a daily basis, and should not have to live on campus if this sort of situation bothers or offends him.

<p>2. Hack thinks he should be allowed to live off campus in a place that will sustain and uphold his beliefs.  While I believe his wishes and morals are admirable, and I fully support him having them, I don't see why he can't just avoid the situations that bother him. It isn't like he can't control what goes on inside his dorm room, and he can choose to ignore that which offends him.  I believe that Yale's rules are probably set so that freshman have to live on campus so that they assimilate better into the college.  I suppose that because Hack is so adamant about his beliefs, it would be less trouble just to let him live elsewhere.

===subject:CA: Jacoby Q 1&2 9/9
===message:1. I believe that the strongest claim for the argument that kids should have to take the MCAS, is that children remember so many facts that are culturally important every day and can repeat them with little problem.  The argument for the MCAS is well presented, showing the reader the types of things kids remember to impress their peers and to be accepted in their school, but this information is the only support to back up the claim.  The argument against the test has some good points as well, stating that simply memorizing facts has little bearing on how smart a student is.

<p>2. The author got very casual and candid during his argument with lines like "But pressuring kids to master reams of facts isn't one of them." showing that he felt MCAS were completely in the right with asking students to memorize these things.  His tone indicated that anyone thinking the opposite was clearly not wrong and not informed, and I don't believe this type of language is very persuasive. It has a greater chance of offending the reader than showing them the benefits of agreeing with the other side.  If a reader is offended, they aren't going to listen to what else the author has to say.

===message:The topic I have chosen for my Final Project Task is privacy in the information age, with an emphasis on the internet and the need for privacy there.  I plan to include information about organizations such as e-bay, which acquire credit card information for purchasing purposes, and websites that may contain personal information or acquire information from a personal computer.

===subject:CA: Patterson Q1-4
===message:1. Patterson states his claim in the very first sentence of the article.

<p>2.Patterson's main thesis: Census results are misinforming the nation
<br>-He believes that several articles are wrong (eg. Articles echo information that isn't completely true)
<br>-He believes "white" is not just people who have always been thought of as "white" (eg. Hispanics often classify themselves as white, adding to numbers)
<br>-He shows statistics (eg. Whites still constitute 75.14% of total population)
<br>-He shows how bad information can hurt racial integration (eg. Reinforce stigmatism to groups that have never been "white")

<p>3. Misleading data not only adds more rage to white supremist groups, leading to move angry outbreaks, but it also aids in making non-extremist whites feel adversely to programs like affirmative action, which many minority groups still rely on

<p>4. I believe political analysis is more susceptable to challenges simply because it is just that, analysis.  Perhaps a politically involved individual sees things differently and has facts to back up his own claim that normal people wouldn't have access to.  Since Patterson is only offering an analysis of politics, he may not be entirely correct on what is truly going on.

===subject:CA: Energy Ad Q 1&2 9/18
===message:1. The ad tried to make a strong emotional appeal on the grounds of danger to family.  I don't believe the ad is terribly justified because it doesn't offer any facts or statistics- has gas heat been proven dangerous in tests? Have there been many children affected by gas heat? Facts like this would justify the claim.

<p>2. I would verify it on learning more about oil heat.  Perhaps the ad could compare statistics between gas and oil heat, because I know nothing about oil heat and how it works.  For someone to be able to know that oil heat is indeed the safer choice, they need to be presented with facts.

===message:I believe this is partly true.  While it does seem degrading to judge contestants soley on their appearance, "beauty" pageants incorporate many other talents and strengths now.  I think the stereotype exists because it as true in the past that contestants were judged on looks alone, yet even though it is no longer true, the stigma has yet to be fixed.

===message:I agree with the people my group chose to keep.  Our reasoning behind our choices was that we needed the most viable females for child-bearing purposes. These are the people we chose to keep, and why:

<br>A. Dr. Dane- he is healthy, young, and has a good background in history so the culture wouldn't be completely lost.
<br>C. Bobby Dane- while he may not be incredibly bright, he is healthy and strong and can work on labor tasks the group might need done
<br>D. Mrs. Garcia- she is young and at a good child-bearing age, and can have children since she has an infant daughter
<br>E. Jean Garcia- we couldn't justify killing a three month old, she is healthy and a good start on the next generation
<br>F. Mary Evans- she is young, has a good educated background, and is at child-bearing age
<br>G. Mr. Newton- he is healthy and fairly young, he is also starting his last year in medical school so his skills would definitely be needed
<br>H. Mrs. Clark- good age and health, has a strong religious background so she can spread religious beliefs to the next generation

<p>2. That the user cares about the enviornment and the inhabitants fuel can harm.

<p>3. I believe that this ad is stronger because it offers real facts to support the claim.  I also think that positive is stronger because it makes one feel good about helping.

<br>Testing and what it's used for
<br>Objections to abolishing
<br>Reaons for abolishing
<p>2. He seems to emphasize on how grading can adversely effect students and how many students' bad habits or bad experiences are a result of grading
<p>3. Because they are private schools and can do what they wish without problems from the government.
<p>4. He states very early on that he proposes abolishing grading, in the first sentence and title of essay.
<p>5. Teachers continue to give grades because they are necessary to employers, scholarships, and even getting into college.
<p>6. He believes testng should be to see what the student has learned and comprehended, and what is right and wrong.  Instead, students simply review information they believe will be on the test and retain only until the test instead of actually learning and understanding it.

===message:1. God- a religious creation of a being that made everything we know and continues to watch over us

<p>2. Affirmative Action- helping minority and underpriviledged people get better jobs and education they may not have gotten otherwise.  Others may see it as giving special treatment to minority students and putting their needs above those of the majority.

<p>3. Sympathy- feeling the same emotion as another to aid or ease their pain
<br>Pity- feeling sorry for someone because they have it worse than you or something bad has happened to them

<p>4. Good parent- an individual who establishes good moral and ethical bounds to help their child grow and develop into a good person.
<br>So if a child does not turn into a good person in society, does that mean their parents were not "good"? Is it solely the parent responsibility to make sure their child turns out okay?  What makes up good moral and ethical ideas, and are they the same for everyone?  Can you say that a person's morals are not "good"?
