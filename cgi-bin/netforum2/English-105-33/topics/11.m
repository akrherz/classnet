===subject:How much our semester project should count.
===message:We had a bit of debate in class today over what percentage of our overall grade would be assesed to our FPT (final project task). Some replied that we should not allow it to be more than 20% (one person suggested 2%) and some stated that it should not be less than 40 to 50% of our final grade. I personally think that, for the amount of work we will be required to pour into it, that 40 to 50 percent is not so outrageous. But that's just my personal preference. What do you think? Feel free to post replies (if anyone is actually reading this) before Mr. O makes the final decision.

===subject:CA: Jacoby Q#1&2 9/9
===message:1)   I believe that the strongest piece of evidence for this claim (that students are quite capable of mastering the skills needed to succeed on the MCAS's) is that teenagers actually perform the tasks required for these tests every single day. Movie stars, pop singers, designer clothing, new fashion jewelry, fad diets, star idol gossip, new movies, latest shoe design, basketball scores, new baseball players, the latest sports car model, who said what on soap operas and "reality" shows, the newest issue of Cosmopolitan... I haven't even scratched the surface of what teens these days wallow themselves in and reugurgitate all of their waking hours. Are they capable of memorizing obstruse or detailed facts? Hell yes! I think SCAM only has half an argument to boot. Teens can definitely handle the test requirements fo the MCAS's. But as to the devaluement of "technical, linguistic, musical, atheletic and vocational skills" SCAM may have a point. I have had the experiance that when schools teach skills for demanding standardized tests, the will often neglect other skills or topics for the sake of efficiancy. There is a fine line to tread here -- on one side, standardized tests provide a basis for enrollment in college, and on the other side, tests can harm other, equally valuable skills, topics and learning activities by pushing them into the "unecessary category".








2)   "But millions of boys meet it."
     "...teenagers routinely subject to their peers."
     "...it is easily refuted."
     "...mocked, shunned and generally flunked..."
     "...mandatory for the 'in' crowd."
   I believe that Jacoby uses compelling and very persuasive language and arguements without being overbearing or boorish. He qualifies his statements and concedes to certain points -- and then counters them. He is also very moderate in his language and stays away from sounding like an elder on a tirade about the wippersnappers of today. Although he is not outwardly supporting the good of the MCAS's, he supports it in a way by countering the arguements laid against them. I believe that his main point is not that the MCAS's are needed, rather, that teenagers are fully capable of the skills it demands and that their complaints are just adolescent whining.

===subject:CA: Hack Q#1&2 9/9
===message:1)   Hack's "moral code" is something to be admired (in my opinion) and adhered to. He believes that there should be certain rules governing how students behave, especially when it comes to sexual activity. He believes that women should not be alled to spend the night in mens' rooms and that men should not be allowed to tromp up and down the womens' dorms at all hours "in various stages of undress". He is frankly appalled by the lingo promulgated by the university's own publications, one containing a definition that condones sexual activity at the expense of others. He's a rare guy, to be sure.
2)   Hack's main contention is that students under the status of junior should not be required to stay in the dorms of Yale. He wants to be able to live outside of the dorms to avoid the rampant behavior his fellow students conduct. Yale (accoroding to the author) has stated that all students under the age of 21 who are not married and carry a freshman status or sophmore standing must reside in the campus dorms. This violates not only the author's personal preferences, but the precepts of his religion. I personally can find nothing wrong with students living off of campus. Either Yale has a good reason for enforcing this rule, or they are just trying to squeeze the dollar out of students by making them live on campus.

===message:1. He states his claim in the first sentence of the first paragraph. Very straighforward.
<p>
2. Subtitles:
               No Possiblity of White Minority,
               Race Census Reports Misleading,
               Racial Divisions Cause a Vicious Circle,
               Honesty and Forthright Dealings Needed
<p>
3. It causes dangerous rifts in society over unfounded information and perpetuates a vicious cycle of an "us vs. them" mentality. Patterson believes that the natural melding of ethnic groups that occurs naturally in America should go on unhindered, and that special racial-political groups often serve only to hamper rather than help racial relations. They may believe that they're "getting their rights" when they actually are only fomenting fears and insecurity among other groups.
<p>
4.  The varied sources of information and support helped immensly to substantiate Patterson's claim. His best unit of support is probably his draw on historical govenment racial naming policies. He explains how racial qualifications oscillated back and forth in the early 20th century, complying with his claim of how meaningless these transient qualifications are anyway. He also illustrates how may races aknowledge multiple groups in their hereditary lines, blurring together the sure divisions of race. The contention most susceptible to challenge would be that "we need honesty with census statistics" - statistics can be tilted to say any number of things and still technically be accurate.

    Naturally, I can agree with this claim. Canada already has laws against beauty contests for the very reason that is supplied here. Beauty contests (in my limited experiance) often focus on bodies and superficial physical elements about women that often undermine self-esteem and personal value. Examples behind this "stereotype" are the women that are pushed to participate - they are often unintelligent and uneducated, although with the increase in the achievement of higher education, many beauty contests also include talent show qualifications as well. I personally disapprove of them. Women have been itemized for far too long in history for us to still be continuing the practice. Stone age.

===subject:CA: Goodman, Q#1-6, 9/25
===message:1.)    Subtitles
Grading Hinders Teaching and Promotes Illicit Behavior
Parents' Opinions Have No Merit
Grading Prevents Mastery of a Subject
Grading is Poor Motivation for Contrary Students
Students Deserve to be Treated Like Adults
Businesses Don't Necessarily Need Good Grades When Hiring
<br>
2.)   The parts of the arguement that stood out more than the others were the parts that spoke of student motivation and cheating behavior. I think this is is strongest point. He states that grades only hinder bright students who learn differently, and promote cheating and plagiarizing to "get the grade". He's trying to say that grading devalues learning itself.
<br>
3.)   I think it is because these universities set the precedent for all universities, and that smaller universities may be exempt from this "grading ideal" that Goodman believes to be so derogatory. He seems to have studied the learning environment of these "prestigious universities" and seems to have more of an authorative opinion of them rather than all universities combined. Perhaps he believes that these few elite would lead all of the other institutions to change as well if they were to actually dispose of the grading system. We'd have to question Goodman directly on that matter, which is impossible seeing as he is dead.
<br>
4.)   The author reveals the purpose of his proposal all around in his essay, but never really says it in black in white. He wants grading to be abolished because it does "no       good". He implies this by various means, examples and support and rational and uses language to appeal to the college student audience.
<br>
5.)   Goodman states that professors do indeed dislike grading, but that they continue to use it because they see no other option. He says that they believe it to be ievitable. Otherwise, what other effective method would exist to properly represent a student's potential to the employer market? He counters this by saying that employers and companies should give thier own exams (and indeed that they sometimes do) to properly evaluate what an applicant is capable of in their job setting. I have to say that although this is a great idea, it probably will never happen. This is because we live in an age where everyone wants everything to be faster and more efficiant, even at the cost of quality. For companies to develop special tests and examinations requires time, money and manpower. How many companies are going to put in the work for that, even if it gets them better candidates? It's just easier to accept the national standardized test score and hire someone based on a composite comparison of everyone else.
<br>
6.)   Goodman believes that testing should not evalutate regurgitation of facts or special standards, but should function to show a student where they are lacking in thier knowledge and to help them conquer it. He believes that current grades and tests are antagonistic to students, rather than helpful. He believes that the drive for the grade nullifies the student's desire to improve and really learn by pushing the importance of a number at the end.

===subject:CA: Ad, pg 221, 9/25
===message:1.) First off, are butterflies superior to other flora and fauna for the purposes of this ad? Yes. They are very pretty and catch the eye of the apathetic viewer and make them think about pretty things that they could save from harm. Easy, huh? This ad stresses the environmental slant of natural gas - that it helps to (perhaps) reduce pollution (it's much "cleaner" at least) and that it helps to conserve energy (once you follow a certain energy plan they provide).
<br>
2.)   They assume that you would associate "cleaner" energy of natural gas with "creates less pollution than fossil fuels". They never actually say that it creates less pollution. They also assume that adults are reading this ad, as energy needs and saving money do not apply to children generally. They also assume that people like butterflies and would stop to consider using natural gas to "save" more butterflies. 
<br>
3.)   I believe that the Metropolitan Oil ad is a stronger and more aggressive ad, in that it implies danger to your family. The BostonGas ad is more positive in that it stresses the good of natural gas and the benefits to the environment. One is much closer to home because we naturally think more about our family than we do about the environment (well, at least most do). The MO ad is much more negative and stresses the downfalls and dangers of gas, rather than the benefits.

===subject:CA: Justification in Class of Personal Values, 9/23
===message:The following is a basic justification of why I chose the people I did from the list presented to us in class. My group decided on a survival scenario based on a space colony's need for resourcefulness and population growth.
<br>
Dr. Dane - I chose him for age (not too old), for his knowledge (PhD) and good health. He could still be potent and able to procreate.
<br>
Mrs. Dane - Sorry, I sent her back to Earth. She is rather unhealthy and is dangerously close to an age where child-bearing is difficult and unadvised.
<br>
Bobby Dane - I chose him to stay. He is young, strong and able bodied, can at least follow simple instructions and training and could be useful for manual labor that any community rebuilding would require. 
<br>
Mrs. Garcia - I chose her as well. She is young, of ethnic diversity, of child-bearing age and is female. It is my general opinion that societies where the women are the majority are rather stable (provided they are in some position to guide governance).
<br>
Jean Garcia - I decided to keep her. She could help the group get a jump-start on the population growth and she is female and a future population necessity. We have also chosen her mother, so she would not be an undue burden on anyone else (provided Mrs. Garcia could take care of the child sufficiantly).
<br>
Mary Evans - I kept her. She is young, of easy child-bearing age and could add trade skills and artistic creativity to the group. Humans need art (in my opinion), so social moral could be boosted by her presence.
<br>
Mr. Newton - I kept him (I like his cookies!...not.) He is young, educated in medical arts, is healthy and could promote healthy living among the group. Although he may be suspected of homosexuality, he is still capable of procreation, or at the very least, child-rearing.
<br>
Mrs. Clark - I kept her as well. She is young and of child-bearing age, and could lend diversity to the group. If we are on a space colony, her electronics background would be an enormous asset to the group. Her views on population would probably shift considering her new situation.
<br>
Mr. Blake - Well, he went back to Earth. He is too old and my main concern would be political and physical conflicts between him and Newton. Our group must be stable to survive.
<br>
Father Frans - Nope, he left on the homeship too. His background on farming my not be too helpful, and for lack of other reasons, he is male and we need all the females we can get.
<br>
Dr. Gonzales - He left with Frans and Blake. He is too old, is in poor physical condition and we already have two Spanish-Americans. We already have a medical figure so he is not detrimental.
<br>
And that about sums up my personal views and values of this particular group. Surprisingly, my group agreed with all of these, athough our reasons may have been different. Our overall reasons were population growth and stability.

===message:Well, I have narrowed my topic a bit. I have decided to focus on the media and public image of Welfare, in otherwords, what people think of it. I've had a lot of experiance with this and so has my interview subject Dr. Margaret Elliott (PhD). I checked out about a dozen books on welfare, including ones that focuse on racial biases in welfare (a book called "Let them eat Ketchup!"), on history (a book called "Government and the Welfare State") and on general experiances of those who participate (a book called "Can Anyone Hear Us?"). I have found the subject of welfare to be both fascinating and highly vexing, as I don't wish for ultra-libral socialist views, but I don't agree with conservative hands-off movements either. Sifting through the information is trying and difficult, but I learn a lot of stuff about something that has affected my life since my birth. I have yet to pick a journal to submit to and I really don't know where to start. I plan to ask Mr.O if he can help me out in that department. Well, that sums up last week.

===subject:CA: pg 153 Q#1-4, 10/2
===message:1.)    D. The marine corps need good men.
"Good men" is a term that, of course, means something different to everyone who hears it. What is a "good man"? Well, I would define a good man in women's terms, naturally, but I could also define a good man in marine corps terms. The descriptions will be drastically different, but since this is my own definition, I will use my own experiances.
A good man.
A good man is one who trys hard at all he enjoys and tries harder at those he doesn't. A good man is one who likes laughing at silly things like rug patterns and cereal boxes, even if only to get a crying child to laugh with him. A good man is understanding (or tries to understand repetitively) and is good at trying to be understood. A good man is one who yells just as loudly as a woman in an arguement, because he values the goals he is trying to prove and he won't just throw up his hands and say "Whatever!". A good man forgets to put the toilet seat down, loses his job when he can't agree with the ethics of the boss, crashes the car while yelling at someone else, and lets the dog eat off of his plate on top of the table. He tells half truths a few times too often and the real truth a few times too late. He races on his lunch break to the school to sit in the elementary cafeteria with his son to eat peanut-butter sandwiches. That is a good man. I can't say good men, because men of this definition are too few to congregate into a plural word. Ah ,well, this definition was way longer than I intended and I apologize.
<br>
2.) C. Affirmative Action.
There are thousands of good and thousands of evils that surround this term. Once started to help the racially descriminated and the gender-unequal workplace, it has expaned to cover all types of programs from rent grants to university admissions. Affirmative action is good in that it is a valid attempt to help the disadvantaged. AA helps poor mothers get better jobs by helping them get a cheaper education. AA helps diversity in homogeneous settings by pushing in races who normally would have to go somewhere else. AA helps young women get over intimidating math curriculum stigmas by drawing them in to math oriented programs. But AA has it's downfalls. It can push out better candidates for admission over someone of a darker race in university admissions. It can give scholarships to African-American students who put forth little effort and skip over a white student working very hard for the same grant. AA can slant programs to lower the bar to "help" the educationally disadvantaged, when it doesn't help them achieve better standards at all. AA has also developed a stigma that has turned many public officials against it and many believe it should be abolished all together. So what is the better thing to have? AA or no AA?
<br>
3.)  Like and Love.
These are two words that many people use every single day of their lives when they have no idea what they are actually saying. "I love that hat!" "I love those shoes!" "I love the Yankees!" "I love this car!" All of these phrases actually mean that the proffessent likes the object -- not loves. They are describing brief fancies and fettishes that last only for a few days or months. I believe that love and like are very different things. Love is something that lasts for a really long time (not to also be confused with 'lust')-- for years and years even. It is a feeling that resonates in the core of your being and skips across your mind randomly from time to time. "I really like this car!" "I like your hat!" "I feel so good about this selection of lipstick!" These are more "true". They express a preference, not a life-long bond. Love is something far more profound, but has somehow been integrated into our language into meaning "like". So how do you know when someone is telling you they are willing to hold a profound and fulfilling life feeling for you and not that they wanna hang out with you for fun and the benefits of your body? Well, that is up to ourselves.
<br>
4.)   A good parent.
I'll have to say my mother, when she had her first child (me) she was not a good parent. In fact, she was awful. She got drunk a couple of times and stayed out late, but then had to come home and take care of the baby. It was then that she came to a realization -- that she couldn't do that anymore. She had two more children after that and although she was irritable, unencouraging and a free hand with the belt, she made sure we never went hungary. We had clean clothes, shoes, school supplies and warm beds. She began stop watching TV to help us with our homework. When my father came home too many times drunk from grocery money, she left him and decided to go back to school. The she got REALLY cranky! She was difficult to get along with and had little free time. And yet she found time to practice state capitols and spelling words with me. As she struggled through school on welfare, she began to value free time with us and began to be interested in the things we liked. She had always like the park swings and we would climb trees together with her on the weekends. And she told us she loved us more and more and laughed more often then she yelled. Now , after ten years of school and several years of debt forthcoming, she tells us she loves us every day (in between calling us a pack of idiots with herself included). She isn't perfect, but she fought hard to raise us, kept us fed, moved us to better schools, helped us with homework, played our games and valued our troubles. She's the best. Margaret Katherine Elliott is a good parent.

===message:Well, I didn't get much research done for this week, but I did get a lot of new ideas that make this whole project seem much more conquerable. First off, Mr. O informed me of a journal that would more than likely accept my essay with little difficulty. Second, I recently discovered an article in the New York Times that discussed the prevailing trends in Welfare in terms of money distribution, programming and percent usage. It was really a good refresher on today's current trends as many of the resources I'm relying on are dated from 3 to 10 years ago. I was also greatly gratified to learn about the trend and I feel good about giving up some of my paycheck to help impoverished kids get better childcare and impoverished moms gain greater economic dependence from the rather constrictive welfare system. And I also have a better concept on the format of the entire essay itself. What was originally a rather scary project has become more palatable and certainly more digestable.
