===subject:CA: Elisha Dov Hack Q 1& 2 9/9
===message:1. He does not want to live in a place where men and women are free to interact at all hours.  His religion believes that it is wrong to have sex before marriage and to allow someone of the opposite sex in your bedroom.  He disagrees with the concept of "sexile", which is being banished from your room because your roomate wants to be alone with someone of the opposite sex.  He also feels that the University should promote abstinence rather than giving away free condoms.

2. Hack proposes that Yale should allow students to live off campus if dorm life compromises their religious beliefs.  Yale refused because they require all freshman to live in the dorms, but i'm not really sure what the purpose of that is.  I think that Yale should allow them to move off campus since they allow underclassmen who are married or over the age of 21 to live wherever they choose.

===message:1. I think the strongest evidence supporting the claim is that if students can memorize random facts about the entertainment industry they should be able to do the same with academics.  I think that SCAM's arguments are valid.  Students shouldn't have to memorize random academic facts that they could easily look up in the future.
2. I think that the author disagrees with all the tests students subject one another to.  He feels that it would be much more valuable if they learned something educational rather than random teenage facts.

===subject:CA: Metropolitan Energy Council Q 1&2 9/18
===message:1. The ad insists that gas heat is dangerous.  It appeals to a person's "safety need" and makes you scared that you or your family will be unsafe if living in a house heated by gas.  It makes a person feel as though they are just a name to the gas company and they will only help you if you have a serious problem.
2. You would need to determine if the evidence given is valid and well researched.  I don't think that this ad gives any credible evidence that gas is dangerous or that the gas companies don't care about their customers.  It is based on one person's opinions rather than any kind of statistic.

===message:8e. No, I don't feel that beauty contests are degrading to women.  The women are not forced to do anything that they don't want to do.  They choose to join the contests they want to participate in.  I understand how people could feel that the swimsuit competition is degrading, but I don't think of it as them getting judged on their body, more as them getting judged on their level of physical fitness.  Women are motivated to participate in contests in order to attain national recognition and scholorship money.

===message:1. Paragraph 5: "There is no possibility that whites will become a minority in this nation in this century."
2. -statistics on percentages of different races  -misleading reports lead to racist fears  -cencus bureau policy  -history of reclassification by federal agencies
3. He thinks that the misleading reports will sustain racist fears of white supremecist groups.  Whites are afriad that they will soon become the minority and therefore have less power over everyone else.
4. I think that statistics are the most solid form of evidence because they are researchable facts.  Political Analysis is the most succeptable to challenge because the census keeps changing the way citizens can classify themselves and therefore does not remain consistent between each one.

===message:I agreed with the people my group chose to save.  They are as follows...
A)Dr. Dane---He is in good health and is a value to the group because he is still at the age to produce children.  He is smart, has a PhD in history, and enjoys politics.  He could hopefully set up a knew form of goverment and establish some rules and regulations.
D)Mrs. Garcia---Although she was a prostitute, she is obviously able to have children since she has a 3 year old son.  She is a valuble asset to repopulate the world.
F)Mary Evans---She is also at the child-bearing age and is needed to produce children.  She also has some sort of education and artistic ability.
G)Mr. Newton---He is in his final year of medical school and therefor would already fairly competent in tending to anyone who is sick or injured.  He is also a physical fitness buff and could keep the population healthy.
H)Mrs. Clark---She is able to produce children and came from a religous background, so she could hopefully help the rest of the population with their religous beliefs.  She has an engineering degree and could hopefully help rebuild the planet.
I)Mr. Blake---He is quite handy and has experience in mechanics and construction and theirfor could help build shelter and other necessaties.
J)Father Frans---He has a farming background so could hopefully help produce food for the population.  He is also a former college athlete so he is probably healthy and in good shape.

===subject:CA: Paul Goodman Q.1-6
===message:1.Introduction(Gives thesis and example to support)---Test according to specific task requirements---acceptance as a peer v. comparative evaluations---parents and students as objectors---attack of arguments against his own
2.I think the main thing he wants to emphasize is that if schools like harvard have entrance exams why shouldn't jobs have entrance exams associated to their work tasks.
3.I think he chose to only have half a dozen abolish granding so that he could compare the differences between the two.
4.In the very first sentence he says that he thinks that grading should be abolished.
5.The teachers and universities think that grading is inevitable for graduate schools and corporations to choose who they want.  Goodman suggests that corporations make their own aptitude test according to their company.
6.Grading should just be a device for you and your teacher to understand what you are accomplishing.  Grading encourages students to cheat and plagarize in order to get a good grade.

===message:1.It claims that if you use natural gas you can help the enviroment. Not necassarily, but i think the butterflies(if they were in color)would just make the add stand more and draw attention.
2.It assumes that most people want to help the enviroment.
3.I think the argument on p.188 is stronger because that appeals to your sense of safety.  The fact that p.188 is more negative may make it more effective because it would scare their readers.

===message:HACK---I think that in the 3rd paragraph he assumes we know the teachings of the Torah and therefore should understand his religion.  Going to Yale implies that he is well educated and can accuratly express his opinion.
JACOBY---Because the MCAS is one of the nations toughest test, it implies that Massachusetts has a more rigorous public school system.  
MOORE---In the 1st paragraph he implies that industry and labor don't care about the enviroment and global warming.

===subject:CA: p.153 Q1-4
===message:1. I think that the word "equal" means being treated the exact same way as everyone else and being given the same opportunites.
2. Affirmative action is a system to better the lives of minorities by requiring a certain quota of each minority at a university or in the workplace.  The good thing is that it is requiring people to accept minorities and give them the same opportunities as whites.  The down side is that a company may hire a person of a minority just to meet their quota and not because they are the person best equipped for the job.
3.According to the dictionary a person can be jelous of anything bue can envy only a person's possesions or achievements.
4.I think that a good parent loves their child unconditionally in any situation, but they are still able to punish the child for wrong doing. They make sure their child is safe and that they are doing their best to raise their child.  A good teacher is someone that treats all their students equally no matter what their educational level.  They can maintain contoll of their classrooms and have a good way to explain the information.  A good husband or wife should be faithful and treat their spouse with love and affection.

===message:The journal i chose to send my paper to is called "First Things".  It is an intellectual journal focusing on social and ethical commentary.  It contains religous and ethical perspectives on society, culture, law, medecine, church and state and morality.  I think that it fits my topic since i am concentrating on how and why family values in society over the years.  I thought about sending it to a journal on family, but they all seemed to want stuff upbeat and fun for both parents and kids.  The topic of divorce and family values seemed to fit more in a journal of social and ethical conditions.
