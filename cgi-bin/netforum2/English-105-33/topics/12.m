Diagnostic Essay Revision

I love words.  The ability for one to express oneself in any fashion imaginable is possible with merely a pen and a piece of paper.  My passion for words and love of the English language has actually driven me towards my career dream of becoming an English teacher.  As a teacher, I too will be faced with the dilemma of how a student’s writing should be evaluated.  To me, evaluating a paper is a process in which a student’s writing ability, mechanics, and effort is looked over by someone with more experience and knowledge in that area and after some consideration, the student will be given a grade that reflects his or her performance.  Even though the day when I will be grading papers is not going to occur for a while, I have given much thought as to the most fair way to approach this task.
English paper, for many students, are very personal projects into which a student has devoted much time and feeling; I assume that argumentation papers will require many of the same things out of students, although I have yet to attempt a paper of that type.  Because these papers involve feelings about issues that may be controversial, it is quite possible that the tone of the paper may not correspond with the opinions of the person who is evaluating the paper.  However, I believe that an evaluator should remain completely unbiased when grading a paper; a grade should be awarded based on grammas, sentence structure and clarity, creativity, as well as the strength and credibility of the argument.
As I entered this classroom today, I noticed a fairly diverse group of people surrounding me.  If this diversity is easily seen by simply the exterior appearance of the students, I expect that an even larger sense of diverseness will occur in terms of our papers and opinions.  Because of this huge variation in opinions, it would not be possible or just to imply that one argument is more valid then another, as long as all arguments can be supported with creditable sources.  If a student has met the criteria for a ‘B’ paper, a student should receive that grade regardless of how absurd or radical his or her opinion may be.  It is not up to the evaluator to establish a new moral code for the writer.  The evaluator is to grade a student based upon their success or lack of success in the art of argumentation and to aid the writer by giving tips for improvement in areas that may need some extra work.

Reading and Discussion Questions pg. 94

1.  Hack’s moral code includes beliefs from Judaism, in which he was raised, which imply that he cannot live in a place where women and men can freely stay overnight in each other’s dorm rooms.  His morals do not condone the promiscuous behavior that is not necessarily promoted but also not forbidden in the dorms at Yale.  Hack makes his moral code clear when he states, “I…have refused to do this because life in the dorms, even on the floors Yale calls ‘single sex’, is contrary to the fundamental principles we have been taught as long as we can remember- the principles of Judaism lived according to the Torah and 3,000-year-old rabbinic teachings.”  He makes his disdain for Yale’s “moral code” clear with the following:  “That moral meaning is basically, “anything goes.”  This morality is Yale’s own residential religion, which it is proselytizing by force of its own regulations.”  Another expression of Hack’s moral code is prevalent when he claims, “We cannot, in good conscience, live in a place where women are permitted to stay overnight in men’s rooms, and where visiting men can traipse through the common halls on the women’s floors—in various stages of undress—in the middle of the night.”

2.  Hack thinks the best solution to this conflict of moral codes would be for Yale to keep the same regulations the university held a few years ago and let freshman live at home, just as those who are married or are over 21 are now able to do.  His solution if Yale does not allow this will be to sue Yale as an attempt to protect his religious way of life.  Directly, Hack says, “Yale ought to reflect on and reappraise a policy that compels us to compromise our religious principles.”  The reasons that Yale holds for this new policy of requiring the freshmen and sophomores live in the dorms are not given, Hack only shares with the reader that this is a new requirement that he does not agree with.  At this point, Yale’s rules are not justified because I can see no reason for this requirement. If I were to see some reasons for this rule then perhaps it would seem appropriate, but currently these requirements lack support.



Reading and Discussion Questions pg. 100

1.  In my opinion, the strongest evidence that supports the fact that students are capable of mastering the MCA’s is the blurb about boys memorizing sports scores and statistics.  This information is so valid because nearly everyone knows of a boy who can rattle off such useless information without thinking twice, yet still has problems with memorizing school facts.  That is pretty solid evidence that perhaps today’s students are not spending their time properly; if as much effort was put into the MCA’s, as into pop-culture, students would have much more success and far fewer problems with the standardized tests.  The argument made by the anti-MCA campaign claims, “Learning used to be about a lot of things – imagination, creativity, discovery, and dreams.  But now the state says it’s about one thing – a flawed and unfair test, the one-size-fits-all, high-stakes, do-or-die MCAS.”  Essentially, these people feel that the test is taking away from the overall learning experience and subjecting students to harsh, unnecessary scrutiny.  The opposition has a valid point, as standardized tests do dictate how teachers run their courses and may alter some plans that might have made classes more exciting for an individual pupil.  Another strike against the MCA is that it is not right to make all students take the same test when so many students have horrible test taking skills, poor overall knowledge, or may be disabled to the extent that the MCA is a waste of time.  Teachers are expected to cater to the needs of many different learning styles; perhaps the MCA should be modified for students of various test-taking abilities.

2.  Jacoby makes his position on the MCA’s apparent with the following:  “But if the argument is that teenagers cannot meet rigorous standards of knowledge or memorize all kinds of ‘irrelevant’ details, it is easily refuted.  Just ask the nearest teenager.”  In the paragraph about the young boy memorizing thousands of sports statistics, Jacoby states that at least the questions on the MCA will have fixed answers.  He implies that this will be easier to remember than the mass amount of sport information that changes daily.  The author then shoots questions towards the reader showing how he feels that, in reality, teenagers subject themselves to tests daily that surpass the requirements of any standardized test, it is simply a matter of where students choose to invest their time.  He speaks again in defense of the MCA’s with his closing paragraph, “Surely standardized exams have their faults.  But pressuring kids to master reams of facts isn’t one of them.  We already know they can do it.  The question on the table is whether the subjects to be memorized include English, math, science, and history – or whether the only mandatory subjects will be music, television, movies, and fashion.  I think that this language is completely persuasive.  He has shown critics that kids are already memorizing tons of useless information and that it may even be easier for students to learn what is required for the MCA.  By acknowledging the fact that there may be some problems with standardized testing, he has avoided alienating all readers, but he still makes his position extremely clear and valid.

1.  The first section focuses primarily on reasons why grades are bad, so it should be titled:  the cons of grading.  In the second section, a contrary opinion is presented, so:  Arguments for Grades may be an appropriate subtitle.  Thirdly, philosophic methods in terms of education are discussed and ancient Greek methods are presented:  Ancient Methods in Education.  The proceeding section on testing could be titled:  The Pros and Cons of Testing.  The final sections are directed more towards the psychological aspects of grading and the subtitle should reflect that.

2.  There are definitely some rather valid points and some easily debatable points made in this argument.  For instance, when Goodman states, “I think that the great majority of professors agree that grading hinders teaching and creates a bad spirit, going as far as cheating and plagiarizing,” this point seems very much to be opinion, a few statistics or actual quotes from professors would certainly give this point more emphasis.  Goodman obviously feels that testing should take place by those companies who are offering careers and not the universities, as he states this a few times with a little variation.  “Would not an employer do far better to apply his own job-aptitude test rather than to rely on the vagaries of the Harvard section-men?”  He also says, “Why should Harvard professors do the testing for corporations and graduate schools?”

3.  I think that Goodman calls on, “half a dozen of the prestigious universities” in his argument because he believes that people value these school and their opinions on the grading system more than those of less prestigious universities.  School such as Stanford, Harvard, and Yale are considered to be the “authorities” on education and if these schools truly feel that grades should be abolished then perhaps there is some logic to this argument.

4.  I do not know if Goodman ever truly reveals the reason behind this proposal, he gives numerous opinions to back up his point.  One point does not ever really stick out above all of the other.

5.  Goodman claims that the purpose of grading is this:  “scholastic aptitude and achievement tests used for admission to Harvard are a superexcellent index for all-around Harvard performance.”  “Testing, for both student and teacher is a means of structuring, and also of finding out what is blank or wrong and what has been assimilated and can be taken for granted.”  Goodman’s objections to grading are that, “a miserable effect of grading is to nullify the various uses of testing”  “…thereby inviting the student to conceal his weakness”  “a teacher’s grade is a crude instrument compared with a student’s self-awareness”.

6.  I think that Goodman feels that the purpose of testing should not be to compare the student with others, but to seek a level where he would be challenged and capable.  Testing is nullified by grading because are learning only what they need to memorize to get the decent grade on the test.  As soon as the test is handed in, all previous information is forgotten and students are ready to memorize the facts for the next exam.

Discussion Questions pg. 221

1.  This ad stresses primarily the environmental advantages of using gasoline, but it also focuses a bit on the economic benefits.  Butterflies are not superior to other plants or animals, they are simply gorgeous and represent fresh, clean, spring and summer air and that is something that most people enjoy and can relate to.

2. The advertiser assumes that the reader values the environment and nature.

3. I think the ad on page 188 is much more persuasive.  People would save a child over a butterfly any day, and the point is much more clear on page 188.  The negative ad makes me more open to the positive option than the positive ad closes me off to the negative option.

1. a. "equal"-  everyone is the same and receives privileges and benefits that are not unlike those of anyone else.  Perhaps, it would be better stated to say that everyone has the same opportunity to achieve the same things as everyone else, in America we should have equality of opportunty, but this is not always the case.
b.  God-  the "big buy", my creator, redeemer, savior, everything, God is part of the triune God that I believe in and base my faith upon.
c.  Liberal Education- an education that covers many areas, such as the one I am getting in LAS.  I have classes in Zoology, Philosophy, English, Math, etc.  It is a well-rounded, humanistic approach to education.
d.  Good Men- hmmm, rare.  Just kidding!  Good Men (for the marine corps) would mean selfless, passionate individuals who are willing to sacrifice their lives and put themselves in danger for their country. Just like all of those amazing people across the ocean right now.
e.  Friends- a hilarious T.V. show about a bunch of late-20's men and women who become roomates and friends.
Just Shoot Me- a pretty funny show about some people that work for a fashion magazine.

2.c.  Affirmative Action-an active effort to improve the employment or educational opportunities of members to minority groups and women.
Favorable:  Makes it possible for people from underprivileged families to break out of the cycle and better their lives for themselves and the offspring.  Ex. A person living in extreme poverty because he was unable to get a decent education becuase his parents needed him to work to support the family would really benefit from a full-ride scholarship to a university, after getting a degree, he could get an even better job and help out his whole family and make sure his kids could go to school.
Unfavorable:  People who lose opportunities because of Affirmative Action.  The girl in Michigan who did not get into a university despite her good grades and qualifications because the opening was given to a student for affirmative action.

3.  impoverish- to make poor
    poverty- lack of money or material possesions
4.  Good Parent:  loving, responsible, caring, honest, fair, law-abiding, playful, sense of humor, knowledgeable, understanding
I think that parents should be like this because these are qualities that would be good for children to have in their lives, not all parents have these qualities and that does not make them bad..but I think these are some good ones.

I have narrowed the journals that I will be submitting my paper to three different journals.  I think that I will probably send my paper to "The Family in America"  because this journal's description correlates well with the theme for my paper.  On Friday (October 10, 2003)  I will be attending a lecture about how college and females in the work force are affecting family and what can be done about the situation.  I am still looking for a person to interview, but I would like to have a little more research done so I can sound somewhat informed during the interview.
