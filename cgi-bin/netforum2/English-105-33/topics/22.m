===message:For the final project, I'm taking a pro-choice view on abortion.  I didn't see anything about it in the book, but since it's such a heavily debated subject, I don't think I'll have a hard time finding information.

===subject:CA: Patterson Q1-4
===message:1.Patterson states his claim in the first sentence of the first full paragraph on page 182: "The suggestion that the white population of America is fast on the way to becoming a minority is a gross distortion."
2. 1.There is no possibility that whites will become a minority in this nation in this century
2.The Censuc Bureau creates misinformation about races.
3.  Misinformation is dangerous, since it fuels fears of decline and displacement among some whites
4. I think that the statistics and history are persuasive, as long as they are factual.  However, I feel that his political analysis is the most susceptible to challenge because he mixes too much opinion with too little facts.  His views are very strong, sometimes without much reason.  For example, he calls African American leaders "shortsighted" on pg. 183, for no reason

===subject:CA: Goodman Q1-6
===message:A Proposal to Abolish Grading by Paul Goodman
Questions 1-6
1. 1)Why the idea that "grading is inevitable" is ludicrous.
   2)The ancient history of examination
   3)Parents and students roles in grading
   4)Why grading has a negative effect on "lazy" students
2. a)Some parts are stronger than others.  Some of his points, such as the third full paragraph on page 207, touch on a point so quickly that it is overlooked.
   b)Goodman seems to identify his points within the first two sentences of the paragraph.
3.  I think he calls on half a dozen of the prestigious universities because he truly believes that his idea will be a success.  He feels that if he only had a few willing to try it, it would be such a success that the idea would spread, and all the other universities would end up doing it anyway.
4.  TRhe purpose of his proposal is to allow students to become masters in their field (pg. 207, 2nd full paragraph- in paranthesis)
5.  They continue to give grades because they feel grading is inevitable.  "How else will the graduate schools, the foundations, the corporations know whom to accept, reward, hire?  He replies by asking them to "test the applicants according to the specific task requirements of the inducting institution."
6.  a)Goodman thinks the real purpose of testing is to decide whether or not to accept someone as a peer.
    b)Grading nullifies the various uses of testing because the main aim in grading is to discover weakness.  Testing should be used as a means of structure.

===subject:CA:Ad Q1-3
===message:Questions 1-3 for ad on pg. 221
1.  a) the advantage is that it protects the environment
    b)Butterflies are superior because of their beauty and gentle nature.
2.  The advertiser assumes the reader wants to protect the environment and enjoys having butterflies around.
3.  I feel pg 188's argument is stronger, because it involves a human life.  However, I feel it is only more persuasive for a parent, rather than someone on their own.  The ad on 221 is stronger for a person without children because it is positive and uplifting.
