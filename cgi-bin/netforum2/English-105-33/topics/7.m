===subject:Hack's 
===message:1)Hack has a very strong moral code in the religion of Judaism. He believes he should not be surrounded by people or situations that break his moral code. Ex.(contrary to fundamental principles........paragraph 2, safe sex, make love without having sex........paragraph 3, Yales moral "anything goes"........paragraph 8, cannot live in good conscience where women are permitted to stay overnight.......paragraph 9, Moral message Yale conveys today is not one our religion accepts.........paragraph 10.

2) The author suggests that students should be able to have a choice of where they live while attending Yale. Yale has rules made up for all freshmen and sophmores to live in the dorms. Yales rules are justified. It is their university and their right to make rules about it. People need to abise by the rules. People can argue a point but if they fail, they must deal with the decision or choose another university. In this instince, the author does not even show specific examples from the Jewish religion, so his points are void.

===subject:mcas
===message:1) I believe the strongest support is "irrelevant or so specialized that many adults do not know it." This was a main point presented by scam and the author spins it around on the organization. SCAM believes that many of the questions could not be answered by adults, but the author says that the students have their own social "mcas" everyday. The author believes the only way for a student to "pass" socially is to do well on the social "mcas" and that it should be the same on the academic mcas. SCAM has a very strong point but when it is countered on them it loses much of its influence. 
2) The author is definatley in favor of the mcas. He makes various points supporting the tests throughout the article. He views the mcas as a test of what the students have learned throughout their academic career. I believe his writting is very persuasive, although it did not persuade me. I can understand how many people could change their views on the subject to his own after reading his arguments, but my views differ.

===subject:patterson pg 183 ?'s 1,2,3,&4
===message:1. I believe his main claim is summarized in the 11th paragraph (stating that hispanics can be considered white, yet can also gain advantages from affirmative action)I believe that pattersons claim is implied rather than stated. The hispanic population should either be eliminated as an ethnic background or there should be a change in the definition of a hispanic.  
2. nearly half the hispanic population is considered white in every social sense of the term - policy of censes bureau - long history of such reclassification by federal agencies- many hispanics pursue a unified latino classificatio - latino coalations have been a major factor in loss of political support for affirmative action.
3. It first brings a paranoia among the majority citizens. It also makes the affirmtive action system very flimsy. 
4. I believe the history and political aspects of his article are the most persuassive aspects. The history especially supports this, and was very convincing to me. Bringing up how the Italian, Irish, and Jewish population used to be classifies in a different category helped me understand his claim. It made me link how the hispanic population is linking to the caucaisan just as the Italian, Irish, and Jewish population did. I think the statistics are the most susceptible because the rates of right now can change at any moment. The statistics are only educated guesses and connot be proven.

===subject:Ad on page 188 ?'s 1 and 2, page 193 ? 8e
===message:1. The ad states that gas heat is very dangerous and that oil heating is a better choice. The ad uses the family appeal to state its cause. It states "I think gas heat is dangerous......... too dangerous for my home, my kids." Its implying oil is a safer choice. I dont think it is justified because it makes no comments on how oil is safer than gas.
2. This advetisment is not valid in my mind. The claim has no spport with it and is weak. It uses emotional appeal but does not state any facts. 
8e. Beauty contests are not degrading to women. Women are not forced to be in a contest, they do it willingly. If you consider beauty contests degrading, you must also consider competitons such as body building degrading. I cannot recall anything that is degrading that people willing particpate in.

===subject:survival activity
===message:The way i assembled my list was based on repopulating the world. I view these seven as the best fit to start a new civilization. 
People Saved
Dr. Dane - somewhat young man in good health who is active and exercises. History profesor which could be helpful in many ways. Also interested in botany which could help with food and and politics which could make him a good leader. Also has no religious affiliation so would not be biased towards other religions.
Mrs. Garcia - Young woman. Has bad history but is young and has many years to produce children
Mary Evans - Young woman. Many years to produce children. trade school education could come in handy.
Mr. Newton - Last year of med. school which could be very useful for treating sick and wounded. Young man who is very athletic. Suspected homosexual but if he was forced to, he would hopefully do the job in reproducing
Mrs. Clark - Somewhat young woman. Many years left to produce children. college graduate, electronics engineer which could be very useful. 
Mr. Blake - BS in mechanics could be extremely useful along with experience in construction. Will hopefully be able to control anti-black views now that hes forced too.
Father Frans - somewhat young man. active in civil rights which is a big plus. Has a farming background which is crucial for food needs. Priest, but hopeuflly will be able to help reproduce since it is needed.
People lost
Mrs Dane - An obese diabetic who has a mentally retarded son. Not very good genes to repopulate a world.
Bobby Dane - Mentally retarded. Could set back group. Cannot reproduce yet, could reproduce numerous healthy children by the time he has reached age to reproduce.
Jean Garcia - Only three months old, would hold group back in the first crucial year. Also, none of the men can be sacrificed for her. If one of the women are sacrificed for her, by the time she can reproduce, 8 children can possibly be born.
Dr. Gonzalez - Old man. Two heart attacks in 5 years. May not be able to reproduce and will likely die in next five years.

===subject:goodmans proposal ?'s 1-6, pg 221 ?'s 1-3
===message:1. Proffesors who agree that grading system is corrupt, Why do universities test students on things that corporations and graduate schools should, Medieval did not use competition, If aim of tests is to discover weakness, it can produce faking, bulling, and cheating, 
2. I think that the strongest point emphasized is "If aim of tests is to discover weakness, it can produce faking, bulling, and cheating." This tells that the students do not really learn the material, rather they fake it or cheat. This actually hurts the students who try to learn, and if there was no grading system, these students would not be affected.
3. I believe he wants prestigous to try his theory to see if its successful. If it works in prestigous universitites it should be able to work anywhere.
4. I think the purpose of his proposal is stated in the first paragraph on page 208.
5. They state that there is no way for corporations and graduate schools to know who to hire. Goodman believes that the corporations and graduate schools should give theri own tests and that universities ahould not be doing their job. 
6. He believes testing is a means of structuring, and also of finding out what is balnk or wrong. He believes grading takes this away and makes a student liose focus and only worry about certain aspects of the studies.

1. It suggests that natural gas is much safer for the environment.They wanted to use an image that people would grow more focused on. People would rather save butterflies rather than roaches.
2. The advertisemnt goes along with the fact that people want to protect the enviornment.
3. I believe this one is strong because it has better support. The ad on page 188 makes a claim but does not support it very well whereas this ad is very well supported.

===message:1. All men are created equal. Equal is defined as "being the same in quantity, size, degree, value, or status." This statement is basically saying that every person is created the same. They come into the world without any prior knowledge and develop their own personalities through events in their lives.
2. Nationalism - have a strong devotion to your nation. The favorable is having faith in your nation and feeling safe and secure in it. The unfavorable is the idea that your country is better than others and having too much pride.
3. Arogant and confident. Arogance is having exaggerated confidence in yourself (ex. your ideas are right, you are better than, you are smarter than.) Confidence is believing in yourself while not pushing it on others.
4. It is hard to define a "good" parent, teacher, wife, ect. Everyone has different ideas of these. I believe a "good" wife is someone who is there for you, faithful, and understanding. The assumption is just my personal belief and it will vary depending on the person
