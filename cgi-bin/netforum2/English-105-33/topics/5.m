===subject:CA:Hack Questions 1&2 (9/9)
===message:1.  Hack presents the idea that his cultural upbringing as raised him to be a firm believer on the issue of sexual relations before marriage.  He believes that Yale University should support his beliefs and allow him the opportunity to attend Yale without sacraficing his moral code.  He gives examples of conduct which he sees around the campus supporting safe sex, or advertising the availablitly of free contraceptives.          2.  Hack proposes that the school not change it's policy on it's lack of "parietal rules," but rather change the policy that deals with housing for freshman and sophmores and allow him a several other students in his position to live in non-campus housing.  Yale considers itself open-minded, and accepting by allowing and "anything goes" policy in it's dormitories.  However, Yale has not considered the fact that by allowing anything and everything to happen they are actually supressing some students beliefs which seems to undermine the original intent of the policy.  Yale has good intent by trying to open students to a new environment and allowing them to meet other people, however, if a students "fundamental principles" and moral standards are being comprimised, the policies should be changed.

===subject:CA:Jacoby Questions 1&2 (9/9) 
===message:1.  The strongest argument Jacoby has presented that claims that students are capable of memorizing dates and names because they do memorize dates, dates, and other useless information from sports, the music industry, etc.  The student coalition makes a good argument however that the information on the MCAS are not as useful to the students during the course of interaction with their peers and therefore is not top priority.  I feel that the argument is solid.  The difference between the information on the MCAS and the "non-essential" information students know, is that the students are not memorizing the non-essential, but learning it.  Names and dates on the MCAS are not learned, and will soon be forgotten.  2.  I think that the essay was written more to express his opinion of the student coalition and the anti-MCAS movement and not the test itself.  His tone is sarcastic and demeaning in nature, as shown here, "You think the MCAS and tests like it are too difficult?  You find it crazy that so much should ride on a teen's ability to spit back dates ans figures he'll never use again....What then do you make of the 'MCAS' to which teenagers routinely subject to their peers?"  Jacoby's writing was not persuasive in the least, and only manages to create anger amongst the anti-MCAS movement.  Perhaps Jacoby failed to pass his own peer's "MCAS" tests, but something has made him very angry about the whole thing.

===message:For my topic, I have chosen to write about an older, yet evolving problem, and that is privacy during the information age.  So many new inventions and adaptations have made more privacy available, but others have also impeded our privacy.  I intend to determine the amount of privacy that will be acceptable for the modern day and age.

===subject:Survival Activity (9-25)
===message:Dr. Dane - No-   My group and I chose not to save Dr. Dane unlike many other groups because we could not keep his family.  Even though he would most likely be able to tackle just about any project or job thrown at him, we did not feel taht he would be able to cope withhavingto leave his family behind.  I think that it would be harder to ask someone to stay behind than to ask someone to leave their family behind.
Mrs. Dane. - No- Mrs. Dane had to go simply because she would not be much use to the group in rebuilding efforts.  Being diabetic would not make her a good candidate for reproduction perposes, and being overwieght might hinder some physically hard activities that the group will have to endure.  Having a counselor around might help people cope with the tragedy, but the negatives out-weighed the positives.
Bobby Dane - No- Though strong and healthy, we could not keep Bobby simply because he is Mentaly retarded.  First, reproduction would be impossible.  Second, someone would have to watch over Bobby and keep him focused on his task.  Bobby could complete any task that was set before him, but I believe that someone would have to help him.  I could not trust him to do something on his own.  And when seven people are fighting for the survival of the human race, they all need to be able to be independant.
Mrs. Garcia - Yes - Lack of Moral standards or not, this is a healthy women capable of reproduction.  She is also youthful and will be able to help with physically enduring tasks.
Jean Garcia - Yes - Jean is the one exception to the independance rule.  She is healthy baby however, and will make a good start to the re-population of earth.
Mr. Newton - Yes- Young, strong, and a doctor, perfect for just about anything.  The homosexual tendencies could prove a problem, but hopefully, faced with the job that all seven of them are, he will be able to become involved in the process.
Mrs. Clark - Yes-  A young women capable of giving birth.  I believe that the Zero-Growth beliefs won't be a problem now that there is no population, and her college education will be useful.
Mr. Blake - Yes- Contruction experience will be very useful, but the anit-black views could pose a problem, but I believe that his views will be overlooked when faced with thhis situation.
Father Frans - Yes- Definitly a must.  Farming experience is the most important of them all.  No civilization can exsist without food production.  Also, he will be healthy due to his athletic background.  He will also be able to keep Mr. Blake in check.
Dr. Gonzales - No- Though the only experience doctor, with two heart attacks by the age of 66, he will not last long after a nuclear holocaust.  Also, a doctor of his experience is not needed due to the lack of medicine and other medical utilities.  All that is needed is a basic understanding, which is possessed by Mr. Newton.

===subject:CA:  Jacoby:  Direct Policy Claim?
===message:If we are looking for a direct policy claim, word for word, in Jacoby's essay, then no policy claim directly exists.  However, if by direct reference we are looking for a policy claim, then yes, a policy claim does exist.  When Jacoby asks readers, "...what about the rest of us?"  He is refering to the entertainment industries defintion of entertainment and art.  And that definition does not coincide with Jacoby's VALUES for what the defintion should be, thus Jacoby is asking for the redefintion of entertainment values and principles.
