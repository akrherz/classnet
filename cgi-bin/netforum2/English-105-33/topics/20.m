===subject:Goodmans 1-6
===message:1. A) Teachers and students have lost the values of the education, instead worry more about the grade. 
   B)IN ancient history grading was much different by using the testing method.
   C)Grading is being used only for motivation
2. Goodman emphisizes on the lost values of the grade
3. All he needed to support that specific argument in a credible way was six examples of prestigious universities.  The rest would be assumed.
4. First paragraph
5. Many students are lazy so the teacher threatens them with grading
6. The real purpose of testing is for structuring and finding out what is blank or wrong and what has been assimilated and can be taken for granted.

===subject:FTP: final topic
===message:I have chosen my topic around the idea of responding to terror.  It is still broad and I am working on my ten questinos and narrowing my topic to a specific idea.  Such as some of the measures the US government has gone to after the 9-11 attacks.  But that is still in question and yes I know im far behind!!!

===message:1)e. Better can be difined as comparing one thing to another so as to select one as superior to the other.
2)b. Palestinian homeland- Palistinian homeland consists of Isreal.  Before the the Jewish people came in and forced them out with the help of the U.S.  the Palistines occupied the area called Isreal.  The Jews moved in and forced them into the West Bank and Gaza Strip stealing their territory.
3)A cult is just an extreme case of religion only instead of the people being decieved and taken advantage of like most general religions a cult will use false veiws and mind twisting tricks to fool people into letting the cult leaders control every aspect of their life.  Where as a religion just decieves you out of your money and time and thats it.  
4) A good teacher is one that presents the material that is required for the classroom.  The teacher should try and get involved as personally as possible with the students(unless it's a lecture class).  Also the teacher is responible for giving fair grades and showing responsible leadership when unexpected events occur such as unruling students or questions about material.
