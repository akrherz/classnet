===message:1. Hack's moral code says that men and women shouldn't be able to live on the same floor or have easy access to one another.
2. For Hack's solution he asks to be treated like 21 year old freshman and married students. He thinks if it is ok for those students to live outside the dorms he should be able to also due to his religious beliefs.

===message:1. To me the strongest evidence is the fact that kids actually are capable of memorizing mass quantities of information. Such as the examples they gave like sports stats and the latest fashion.
2. The authour refers to the tests as "a flawed and unfair test.." he also says the questions are irrelevant or so specialized that many adults do not know it". I think this language is persuasive becuase it clearly expresses a negative attitude toward the tests.
