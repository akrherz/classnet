Iraj Omidvar
English 105 Section 33
Questions on claims (93-95) and (98-101)
Tuesday September 9, 2003
<br>
College Life vs. My Moral Code.
<br>
1. Men and women should not partake in pre-maritial sex or sleep on the same floor with eachothers. He cites that persons of hte opposite sex routinely spend the night together and walk around un-supervised in various forms of dress, while the university advertises ways to perform sexual acts wihout actually having sex. And he makes it clear that he is avidly against these types of behavior.
<p>
2. The author wants Yale to allow off campus living for all students, not just those who are over 21 or married. Yale contends that it offers single sex dorms and it's their right to choose where freshment and sophomores live. Yes, I think Yale has the right to dictate where it's students are allowed to live. It's a private university, and the author comes off as more of a whiner who has never actually experienced the dorm life. Instead of first hand experience, he seems to act irrationally on something he knows little about.
<p>
The "MCAS" Teens Give Each Other
<br>
1. The strongest evidence is the mock quiz he gave. I knew all of the answers off the top of my head. This in my mind supported his claim. Their arguments against standerdized testing does make some sense, but I think it's important for High Schools to experience MANY new things. They are young and haven't had enough life experiences to choose a career that they'll stick with for the rest of their life. Standardized testing covers broad ground and ensures that students at least sample a little of many different areas that they could possibly go into for a job.
<br>
2. He uses the word tests, and generally surrounds MCAS with unflattering words such as complaints, subjects, difficult, etc. They do have an impact on the readers feeling towards this test. Any time a person is being informed and something that they have little or no knowledge of they are extremely impressionable. Using dark and foreboding words such as these create an air of distates for a particular subject. Though I don't completely understand why, if he's for these tests he is creating htis feeling in his readers.

===subject:CA: Advertisement Q1-2 9/23 
===message:1. The strong emotional appeal in the ad is saying that the gas company doesn't care about innocent children. No, not from what the ad say anyway. Gas is an explosion hazard, and carbon dioxide is also bad, but neither of these is elluded to in this ad.
<br>
2. I wouldn't look at an ad from an opposing company. This oil company has a vested interest in people thinking that gas in dangrous and switching over. I would look into periodicals and studies that were impartially done and see if they support the oil companies claim.

===message:I do not agree that beauty contests are degrading to women. While feminists obviously have a problem with women WILLINGLY entering a contest to be judged on personal appearance I don't believe it is degrading in the least. There are many types of people in this world, I feel that if a woman is beautiful she has a RIGHT to use that talent to her full advantage. Not all women should have to go to college and pursue careers, not all women should have to become house wives etc. While I personally recommend that they complete college and make a career for themselves I think it's their own choice to do what they want. And if they enjoy it, so be it. It in no way reflects on the gender of all women, so think so is absurd. It's like looking at a construction worker as degrading to men because men "are best suited for physical labor". Maybe that guy just didn't want to go to college, so he used his strength to become a construction worker. Once again, it's his own free will, and it in no way reflects negatively on all men.

===subject:CA: Race by Numbers Q 1-4, P 184
===message:1. (in regards to statistics saying whites will not be a majority) The misinformation is dangerous, since it fuels fears of decline and displacement among some whites, anzieties that are not only divisive, but groundless.

2. Fuzzy math, It's brown and white, Willey reports

3. Releasing mis-information cuases fear and un-due hatred towards minorities.

4. Not, they are not equally persuasive, the argument stating htat there is no possibility of whites becoming a minority in this nation in this century. The people who conducted that research actually have no way of knowing how immigration will change, whether it becomes less, or more in the next century, maybe due to starvation, or plagues. There is really no telling, thus it's easily refuted.

===subject:Abolish Grading 1-6, Sept. 25, 2003
===message:1. Grades are rediculous
Teachers should jump at this chance 
Threatening is harmful

2. Not really, the whole argument seems to be mono-tone and relatively weak. He has no factual evidence to support his claims.

3. a hafl dozen perstigeous universities would give a better indication of whether his hypothesis works, plus they have more credebility. THerefore his eperiment couldn't fail.

4. in the second to last paragraph, he staes that students should grow in something they like, not what they can "pass".

5. He thinks they grade because students are lazy, and it's the only way they can "scare" them into doing the work. He thinks it backfires on them. He thinks that laziness is a character-defense that students slip into to make themselves feel normal.

6. teaching creates a struture, and tells what is wrong, and what can be infered for hte students to know. He thinks testing should tell employers if the person is right for hte job, while education should teach the student something they enjoy, and grow in because they WANT to.

===subject:Ad pg. 221 1-3 Sept. 25th
===message:1. It says that natural gas is much cleaner than other fossil fuels, it's more efficient, and therefore good for the environment. No, but it's perfect for this ad. Butterflies are attractive, and give off a sense of innocence and of being fragile.
<br>
2. THey assume that the environment is an important issue to the reader.
<br>
3. THis one is stronger, that one appeals to the health of our children, yet fails to show any danger. Using words such as clean and environment is an immediate attention getter. This is more of a positive ad, therefore it is a little more effective in my eyes.
