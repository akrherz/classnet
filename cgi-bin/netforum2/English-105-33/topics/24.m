===subject:CA: Hack Q 1&2 9/9 
===message:1.	Hack wants the same permission to live off campus that Yale gives anybody else.  His religion is against inter-sex dorms being that close together so he’d rather live on his own and not worry about it.  I think that is what he is trying to say.  He doesn’t’ feel that it’s a moral environment or surrounding he can call home.  He feels that “we cannot live in a place where women are permitted to stay overnight in men’s rooms, and where visiting men can traipse through the common halls on the women’s floors”

2.	“Yale ought to reflect on and reappraise a policy that compels us to compromise our religious principles.”  They refuse to consider this because they already think Yale’s colleges carry a moral meaning.  I believe Yale’s rules are justified but you should have a choice of where you can live at.  If someone’s uncomfortable in the dorms, let them have other options.

===subject:CA: Jacoby Q 1&2 9/9 
===message:1.	I cannot find any statement that encourages the MCAS.  Every sentence talks about how it is unfair and should be used.  I’m interested to see if there is an actual claim of support for this test that I overlooked.

2.	“It requires students to master an arbitrary collection of facts while giving short shrift to all the other kinds of knowledge they have acquired.”  I think by starting the article out by telling us the complaints helps us understand right away why people are trying to get rid of the MCAS.  That particular sentence above persuaded me right away to think the MCAS were a bad thing.  After reading more I agree with that quote.

===subject:CA: Patterson p.181 Q 1-4 9/23 
===message:1. Patterson stated his claim in the fourth paragraph when he said "In any case, the suggestion that the white population of America is fast on the way to becoming a minority is a gross distortion.” He is trying to argue against this and prove that it’s incorrect. 2. Hispanic whites are intermarrying and assimilating faster than European Americans, racist fears, affirmative action, reclassification of races and African American minority 3. Patterson feels that by releasing inaccurate statistics people get worked over nothing. Some whites may feel that their country is being overwhelmed by other races and may upset them. The media needs to stop over-exaggerating about race issues. 4. There are a lot of numbers and words to work through to get the message Patterson wants to convey. His statistics and analyzation are persuasive, particularly the statistical evidence, however this makes it more difficult to follow.  The statistic that is the most susceptible to challenge is the future prediction statistic for the year 2050. This statistic is probably most likely to differ or change in the upcoming years.

===message:1. The women is trying to protect her family from the gas company. I believe they're evil because they don't care about the little girl in the picture and the effects it may have on her.  This situation could also be devestating on the women's family too, not only the child.  The oil company advertising is trying to promote using oil rather than gas. The women knows that gas heat makes her nervous and uncomfortable and would rather go with oil.  I believe this ad. has very little backing (statistics), therefore it's not justified.  2. This ad would be more reliable if it included statistics of deaths in homes caused by gas heat compared to oil heat.

===subject:CA: Patterson p.181 Q 1-4 9/23 
===message:8e. I believe if you are a contestant in a beauty contest it would not be degrading to you because it is YOUR choice to enter.  You have to know that you may lose and be prepared for it.  You would have to agree that everyone that enters a beauty contest must feel at least somewhat confident with themselves.  They know they're beautiful, whether the judges think so or not.  Some may think that it will bring someone's self-esteem down if they lose and that's one argument.  Some may also think that beauty contests shouldn't even take place because of the fact of picking and choosing the "most beautiful women".  Overall I think this stereotypical idea is party both.

===subject:CA: Goodman's Q 1-6 9/25 
===message:1. I would subtitle the parts into The Technique of Grading, the laziness of students, those who get drawn out because of grades, and the degrading of students by pointing out their weaknesses 2. Yes, some are stronger than others, but it somewhat states which ones are the most important. He shows this in the second to last paragraph where he states “Most important of all, which is that balking in doing the work among most bright students goes on.” 3. I would say he calls on half a dozen of the prestigious because those are the hardest to get into and if someone graduates from there, it is their college name that gets them the job. So basically because they are so highly sought after and tough to enter. 4. I would say the purpose is shown in the second paragraph where he states that the competitive grade has come to be the essence. So in order for it not to effect students to0 hard, they should abolish grading. 5. One of the reasons stated in the text of why teachers still grade is because they try to threaten the students who are lazy. Goodman attacks this by some students are lazy for the fact that they don't want to try something when they are down about being graded, but people will be fired in their job because of laziness. 6. The real purpose of testing should be entirely as teachers see fit. Nullifying the various uses of testing is to see what is blank or wrong, so in order to get the teacher and the student on the same page as to what they are learning and the way the teacher is teaching.

===subject:CA: Advertisement p.221 Q1-3 9/25
===message:1. Using natural gas will save the environment. Butterflies are supposed to be beautiful and they don't bother anyone, so why would people want to hurt them? The ad is trying to convince the reader that butterflies should not have to suffer from fossil fuels because 1, they are innocent and 2, they are here for our enjoyment.  2. They want to save the environment and by using butterflies as the subject helps the reader realize that innocent insects and animals are being harmed. 3. I think the ad on page 188 is too much of an emotional appeal; the butterfly ad is stronger in my opinion.

===message:1)a] All men are created equal, even if they're black, white, or of different ethnic background.  Everyone should be treated the same. <br> 2)c] Affirmative action is a way for minority students to have an opportunity that they would have otherwise been denied. Affirmative action selects students based on race rather than qualifications. <br> 3) Sympathy is having sorrow for one person because of the other.. Both people are unhappy so it affects the other person. <br> 4) Good teacher - Knows the material, interacts and connets with the children or students.  He or she is interested in the material that they teach.  The teacher must have knowledge in the information they teach, which must be up to date and related well.
