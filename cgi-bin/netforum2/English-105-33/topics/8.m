===message:#1. Sex is a sacred act that can only be performed under appropriate conditions.  
Throughout the entire article can examples of disapproval and moral wrong-doings be read. Within the content of paragraphs 4 and 5 are examples of signs and articles posted in and around the Yale campus expressing sex as a practical method of enjoyment and entertainment. Specifically, the sign “100 ways to make love without having sex” (Hack 93) seemed to have defined, in Hack’s mind, sex as a regular practice on campus, just now with multiple methods of going about it. Another example which gives more hints to what his moral code is, was the explanation of the morality of the 1950’s when “students who allowed guests of the opposite sex into their dorm rooms were subject to expulsion.” (Hack, 94), acknowledging the fact that today’s morality has indeed changed.

===message:Question #1:

The strongest piece of evidence that I have found that supports the claim that students can pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System is contained within paragraph 7 on page 99. It is quite amazing how a student can memorize pop culture’s everyday occurrences with outstanding detail by watching and studying what happens, when the same can be applied to their school work. I believe that the argument can be valid in the reason that some of the material in standardized tests does not have relevance to the material learned, and some human attributes are being ignored by the tests. But, I also believe that the knowledge that is learned can be applied, to some degree, to the “irrelevant” material contained within the standardized tests. Stemming from the main branches of math, social studies, english, and science can some of these other attributes mentioned in the article, technical, linguistic, musical, and vocational skills, can possibly be measured. 

Question #2:

The author’s attitude toward the controversy was obvious when he put pop culture into the context of a standardized test that student would observe. The way that the author puts pop culture into the same format as the very tests that these students are taking is very apparent. When put into this view, one can’t help but think that the students are just trying to find another way out of a situation that they don’t even prepare themselves for. With the explained fact of how students can remember the stats after a football game that occurred the night before with amazing accuracy can’t apply the same attention to their own school work, and then displaying that very fact into the context of the tests that the students take themselves is great way to at least get a few heads turning the other direction. By relating the information with something people can understand well, will people begin to understand better and possibly change their mind about.

Jean Garcia - Obviously kept her as she is will be the start of a new civilization for the 7 survivors. The assumption is if she will remain healthy until becoming a grown women. Mary Evans - Chosen because she is another young and fertile female with potential to help reproduce. The assumption would be if her religious faith would allow for multiple partners. Mr. Newton - Chosen because of a medical background and could be useful in times of medical attention. I am assuming that he can deliver babies, because he'll doing a lot of that. Mrs. Clark - Chosen for her electronics engineering capabilities. Assuming that she is an open-minded engineer and can apply to every solution, I decided to keep her. Mr. Blake - I hope that he does not have any problems with Mary Evans or Mr. Newton, but I decided to keep him because of his extensive experience in construction that could provide shelter. Lastly, Father Frans - Chosen to live because of his farming background. Everyone must eat, so he seemed like a valid choice.

===subject:Patterson's Questions 1-4
===message:1) pg. 181, paragraph 2, first sentence: "Many articles have echoed the view that whites are fast becoming a minority in many area of the country, largely because of the growth of the Hispanic population." 
<p>
2) Possibility of Whites becoming the minority is not there or highly unlikely, journalist, analyst, and commentators articles are misleading the nation, reclassifications of ethnicity can cause some undesired effects (e.g. Irish, Italians, and Jews protest on page 183), honest interpretations for the facts. 
<p>
3) The misinterpretation of the races could cause a breakdown of ethnic harmony, meaning the races will seem to look at the situation as whoever has the larger group is the dominate race. Especially with white supremacy groups, this misinterpretation of facts could cause panic and only add "fuel to the fire", as some racist fears of these groups will escalate. 
<p>
4) I think that Patterson's supports are persuasive in the fact that he presents recent statistics and especially historical evidence of what has happened before (e.g. Jewish protests and the Mexican protests). The support that is most suscesptible to challenge would probably be the statistical evidence since statistics can be modeled to say just about anything you want them to say.

===message:8e. Beauty contests are degrading to women. 
<p>
I usually like to see things from both views, so obviously, I see some truth and some fiction. Because society is so infatuated with the perfect look, I can see how beauty contests can be degrading to women. These women could be viewed purely as sex objects and objects of desire and want and nothing more, which does play down on the value of a women. Women not blessed with such beauty could look at this as an exploitation of the women and down play the value of a women, as they are more than just looks. On the other hand, women of great beauty do aquire higher value and continue to inspire younger women and even girls to continue in that pursuit of perfection. With this high status, women have that sense of high value and power in society, making them feel important and needed. Obviously, from there the itemization of women begins and the argument starts over again.

===subject:Goodman's 
===message:1) Grades for students has become more competitive and students will limit themselves to learn what is only required to pass the class and get the highest grade possible. With students worrying about making the grades, students could go as far as cheating or other forms of advantage over their peers. By worrying about what grades we have and should receive, we take away from the actually learning process and don't seem to absorb as much information as possible. Grading is instrument used by teachers to control their students by fear. Grading will cause students to learn only what is necessary to pass the class, but not retain the newly aquired information. 
<p>
2) Goodman's argument about how grades are more of a marker of status and having more competitive qualities now, his idea that students are more worried about the grade they receive than actually learning the material they've been taught is pretty apparent. Although, his argument about teachers using grades as an instrument to strike terror into the hearts of the students so they would get their work done I think is a little off. A teachers purpose isn't to make the student fail. They are there to supply the necessary information and help the student learn. When a teacher tells you "I have no choice but to give you a D", it was probably the students fault, not the teachers completely. Goodman does indicate a lot of the possible negative effects grading can have on students now and in the future. Stating "I think that the great majority of professors agree that grading hinders teaching and creates a bad spirit, going as far as cheating and plagiarizing," and "A student flunks and is mechanically weeded out, who is really ready and eager to learn in a scholastic setting, but he has not quite caught on."
<p>
3) I think that when Goodman chose those particular universities, Chicago, Stanford, and the Ivy League, he wanted to mention some of the more known, highly reputable universities would add to his persuasion of opposing to grading. 
<p>
4) Going along with the supposed increased competition for grades, Goodman reveals his purpose for this purposal on page 207, second paragraph, last two sentences: "My philosophic impression is that the medievals thought they knew what a good job of work was and that we are competitive because we do not know. But the more status is achieved by largely irrelevant competitive evaluation, the less will we ever know."
<p>
5) Grading is said to be inevitable because other institutions need some sort of basis to go by to decide whether or the not the individual will fit in their instituion. Goodman argues if that is case, "would not an employer do far better to apply his own job-aptitude test..." rather than relying on grades established at the universities or other institutions.
<p>
6) Goodman thinks the real purpose of testing should be to help bring learning ideas together, structuring them into actually knowledge that the students can remember and have be part of their knowledge. These tests can also be a very good tool for review over what has been taught by taking all of the ideas and structuring them into "flashes of synoptic insight". Since testing only contains parts of what is learned, grading a certain assignment in which only a few parts will actually show up on the exam, would really defeat the purpose of having to retain all the information learned. The students will only want to learn what is necessary to pass the test, therefore not really retaining the information presented by the teacher.

===message:1) After reading some of the fine print, the property of natural gas burning cleaner than other fossil fuels would be an obvious advantage. Butterflies aren't superior to plants or other type of animals, butterflies have just been associated with peace and beauty in our society, which makes for a great graphic for the this ad. 
<p>
2) One assumption that the advertiser could make is the assumption that the people care about the environment and are willing to change their current fossil fuel usage to natural gas. 
<p>
3) I believe that the ad on page 188 has a stronger appeal to it because of increased sense of fear the ad presents to its viewers. I think that a negative ad would bring a lot more attention because they are riding on the people's fears, which is a strong feeling. Straying away from the positive and negative, the ad on page 188 had people "involved", so I would think people would pay more attention to this ad than the ad on page 221.

Jacoby - He assumes that the "unpopular" group of students don't know about sport or do not keep current with sport, when in fact they could, just do not want to play in high for some reason or other. He also assumes that all students judge other students by what they know of in the current world. What about personality?

<br>
Outline of Jeff Jacoby's Essay, "The 'MCAS' Teens Give Each Other"
<p>
Thesis Statement:
<p>
The MCAS is no different than the "tests" given by teens for teens.
	
<br>
	
<br>
- MCAS: Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System
<br>
		- Regarded has one of the nation's tougher high school tests.
<br>
		- Key complaints:
<br>
			(1) "...it requires students to master an arbitrary collection of facts, while"
<br>
			(2) "giving short shrift to all the other kinds of knowledge they have acquired."
<br>
	
- Teens give each other "tests" 
<br>
		- The "unpopular" crowd of students are supposedly subject to remember thousands of sports stats, lastest music, movie, and popular fashion trends in order to become part of the "in" crowd. 
<p>
	- MCAS are not the only tests containing "irrelevant" material. 
<br>
		- Students supposedly believe that the MCAS "includes an enormous amount of information, much of which is irrelevant or so specialized that many adults do not know it." (Jacoby, pg. 99, 1st paragraph) 
<p>
	- What is essential information?
<br>
		- Even SCAM - Student Coalition for Alternatives to MCAS - should realize that the latest trends in fashion, music, and sports could also be "irrelevant or so specialized that many adults do not know it." 
<p>
		- Yet, many teenagers know of this by considering it essential information and really try to absorb these facts. 
<br>
		- Why not school subjects?
<p>
	- Tests have faults
<br>
		- Idea is not to pressure students to master subjects. It is already known students are capable of doing so.
<br>
		- "The question on the table is whether the subjects to be memorized will include English, math, science, and history - or whether the only mandatory subjects will be music, television, movies, and fashion." (Jacoby, pg. 100, last sentence)
