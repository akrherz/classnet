===subject:Survivor Assignment
===message:Dr. Dane:  I chose to sacrifice Dr. Dane because although he was healthy, I felt that his educational background wouldn’t have been especially helpful to the group.

Mrs. Dane:  Mrs. Dane was the fifth person that I chose to keep alive.  Although she’s not in such good health, I feel that this group of survivors will definitely need somebody to discuss the trauma that they have experienced and the rough times that may lie ahead and Mrs. Dane is trained as a psychologist.  

Bobby Dane:  I chose to sacrifice Bobby.  Although he’s strong and could be helpful with manual labor, I feel like he would be too young and inexperienced to really contribute to the group and might even hold them back.

Mrs. Garcia:  I chose Mrs. Garcia to be the sixth person that I kept alive.  While she doesn’t have much educational background to contribute to the group, she is young enough to fill the age gap between the older members of the group and the new generation that will come about.  Also she will be able to raise her daughter Jean Garcia and have other children as well.

Jean Garcia:  I chose Jean Garcia as the seventh person to keep alive.  I feel that a young healthy baby will be helpful in jump starting the new generation of the group’s offspring.

Mary Evans:  I chose to sacrifice Mary Evans.  Education wise, I don’t feel that Mary had much to offer the group.

Mr. Newton:  I chose Mr. Newton to be the third living person.  A doctor will be incredibly helpful to the group and he is young and healthy.

Mrs. Clark:  Mrs. Clark is the fourth person that I chose to live.  She is still young enough to have children and her background as an electronic engineer will definitely be helpful.  

Mr. Blake:  I chose to sacrifice Mr. Blake.  Although his construction experience could be helpful, he’s not young and I’m afraid that his anti-black views would cause conflict with black members of the group.

Father Frans:  Father Frans is the second person that I kept alive.  He is young and healthy and I feel that his farming background will be an excellent asset for the group.

Dr. Gonzales:  I chose Dr. Gonzales as the person to keep alive.  As he is the eldest of the group, and is likely quite wise, I feel that he will serve as the leader and peacekeeper of this group.

===subject:A Proposal to Abolish Grading Questions
===message:A Proposal to Abolish Grading

1. Some subtitles for this essay could be What Grading has Become, The History of Grading, The Bad Effects of Grading Tests, Dealing With Laziness, Bright Students with Bad Grades.

2. Some of Goodman’s points were stronger than others but all of his points worked together to support his thesis.  Goodman restates certain points to emphasize them throughout the essay.

3. I think that Goodman believes abolishing grading would be most effective at more prestigious schools because they are highly selective and the students there likely value their educations a great deal.  

4. I think the line that most reveals the purpose of his proposal is “The naïve teacher points to the beauty of the subject and the ingenuity of the research; the shrewd student asks if he responsible for that on the final exam.”

5. Goodman says that professors continue to grade even though they hinder learning because the graduate schools and corporations need to know whom to accept and hire.  Goodman replies to this by saying that applicants should be tested according to the tasks they would have to fulfill for an institution. 

6. Goodman thinks that testing should be a mean of structuring and finding out what is wrong-if anything.  He feels that grading tests is wrong because if the idea is to identify weakness, than why downgrade a student for these weaknesses and make him or her feel like she should cover them up.

===subject:Advertisement P. 221 Questions
===message:1. The advantage of natural gas that ad stresses is that it won’t pollute the air and kill butterflies.  The butterflies are superior in this ad because they are simple and not intrusive.  They are innocent bystanders.

2. The advertiser assumes that the user values saving money and fuel, but also that they value beauty and nature.

3. I think the advertisement on page 188’s argument is stronger because it addresses using natural gas as a more life and death situation.  It does influence my choice because I’m more concerned about the life of a child than the life of a butterfly.

===subject:Hack Essay
===message:1. Hack’s moral code is that men and women should not engage in sexual relations before marriage and also that men and women should not be free to be in one another’s bedrooms whenever they desire.  He says that he cannon in good conscious “live in a place where women are permitted to stay overnight in men’s rooms, and where visiting men can traipse through the common hall on the women’s floors…in the middle of the night.”


2. The author proposes that freshman should be allowed to live off campus as are married students and first year students that are 21.  Yale refutes this  by saying that there are no “parietal rules” at the university and that it is up to the students to decide if he or she wishes to engage in these acts or not.  However, the author of this essay doesn’t mention any real support for why Yale requires freshman to live on campus.

===subject:Jacoby Essay
===message:1. The strongest evidence that the author uses to support his point that students are capable of knowing the information on the MCAS is that students pass the tests that they give each other every day.  Teenagers are constantly memorizing sports statistics and the facts about the most popular music groups so they should be able to memorize academic material as well.  SCAMS biggest complaint about the MCAS seems to be that they “devalue technical, linguistic, musical, athletic, and vocational skills…that cannot be assessed on a standardized test.”  I agree with this statement, but I don’t believe that this is the point of the MCAS.  I think the point is to see how well students can recall academic material that they’ve learned over the course of their educations and they serve that purpose well.

2.  When stating some of the complaints that people have about the MCAS, the author uses words like “growls SCAM” and “mourns the narrator.”  These expressions give the reader the impression that the author doesn’t agree with these complaints.

===subject:P. 153 Questions
===message:1. Equal means the same.  For example, I would expect an education of equal quality to students all over this country.  This means that I expect to be getting as good of an education at Iowa State as other students receive at other universities.  

2. Codependency is defined as mutually dependent.  In a negative connotation, the word can mean that a person is psychologically dependent on another person in an unhealthy way.  In a positive connotation, it can mean that people in a romantic relationship may just rather be with each other than not.

3. I think that two concepts that are commonly confused are patriotism and ethnocentrism.  Especially in recent years patriotism has really heightened in this country, but also has ethnocentrism.  To be patriotic means to have pride in one’s country and to be ethnocentric is to believe that your own culture is better than all others.  

4. Definition of good parent:  To provide for his or her children.  To set rules and boundaries and teach them to be good people. 

Assumptions:  Are children not supposed to earn what they need as well as have it provided by their parents?  Is whether or not children grow up to be good people solely based upon whether or not their parents set good boundaries and rules?

===message:     I'm still very unsure of the exact shape that I would like my essay to take.  I'm especially unsure of what exactly needs to be posted as far as the FPT is concerned and what just needs to be kept for the final turn in.  At this point, I am just going over the expectations of this project and trying to figure what needs to be done exactly in what order to make progress.  I think I know what needs to be done, I just need to get going on it.

There's a speaker on the sixth about Body Image and I plan to use that as my lecture.  However, I don't yet know the place and time so I have to keep my eye on the Daily.  I'm still very insecure about this project, but as I complete more and more steps toward the final project I'm feeling better.
