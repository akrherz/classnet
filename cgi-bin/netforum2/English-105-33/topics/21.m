===subject:CA: PattersonQ1-4 9/23
===message:1. Patterson states his claim in the fourth paragraph of the essay. He states, "In any case, the suggestion that the white population of America is fast on the way to becoming a minority is a gross distortion. This is the idea that he is trying to argue against and prove incorrect. 

2. -no possibility of whites becoming a minority
  -Hispanic whites are intermarrying and assimilating 
    faster than European Americans
  -racist fears, affirmative action
  -reclassification of races
  -African American minority

3. Patterson feels that by releasin inaccurate statistics people get worked over nothing. Whites feel their country is being taken over, therefore racial tensions increase. We need the media to stop obsessing about race, and if they aren't going to at least obsess accurately. 

4. His statistics and analyzation are persuasive, particularly the statical evidence, however this makes it more difficult to follow. There is a lot of numbers and words to work through to get the message Patterson wants to convey. The statistic that is the most susceptible to change is the future prediction statistic for the year 2050. This statistic is the one most likely to change or differ in the coming years.

===subject:CA: AdvertisementQ1-2 9/23
===message:1. The women is trying to protect her family from the evil gas company. They're evil because they don't care about the child in the picture, the effect the gas has on children, or how devastating a gas accident could have on that woman's family, just like any other family in America. The oil company is trying to convey that smart people will choose to use oil rather than gas. Smart people, like the woman with the children, care about their family's well-being and how gas doesn't provide that and oil does. 

No, I do not feel this is justified. It's an emotional appeal with very little backing. The oil company is relying on a woman's innate need to protect her children, not on the actual basis of the dangers associated with gas heating versus oil heating. 

2. This ad would be more valid if it included statistics of deaths in homes caused by gas heat compared to oil heat.

===subject:CA: Question 8 9/23
===message:8. 
D. "A dog is man's best friend." This is thought to be true because a dog is loyal, happy, hard-working, and obedient when treated as a 'best friend' by its owner. The dog will have all the qualities of a human best friend while making fewer mistakes, always being there, and never talking too much. There is this stereotypical view of dogs because most dogs have these qualities when treated correctly. It's almost like no man could ask for more. However, this image usually produces the "manly-man," not much of a talker, going out to hunt with his dog, and so on and in that case the man usually chooses to spend so much time with his 'best friend'.

===message:1. -grading hinders learning but is inevitable
-college entrance exams
-history of examination compared to today's expectations
-reasons for keeping testing
-change testing beliefs
-test anxiety affects todays students badly

2. Yes, some of his points are stronger than others. The points regarding keeping the grading system, exams, and the history of exams are his strongest arguments. They are the least subjective and therefore more credible.

3. To point out how confusing everything would become if a few schools got rid of today's standards of testing but at the same time pointing out how someone needs to make the change first and preferably be a highly recognized school so that the change is not looked at as ludicrous but as intelligent.

4. 1st paragraph, page 208

5. He thinks the schools should test the prospective student just like aptitude tests for jobs.

6. The tests should be about structure and assimilation.
Grading nullifies testing because today they are to point out weakness and to degrade the student not to help them.

===subject:CA: advertisementQ1-3
===message:1. Using natural gas will save the environment. Butterflies are beautiful, delicate, and they don't bother anyone, so why would people want to hurt them. Basically, the ad is trying to convince them that butterflies are there for our enjoyment and by using natural gas we'll keep them alive.

2. They want to save the environment and they're into butterflies.

3. I think the butterfly advertisement is stronger. The other one is too much of an emotional appeal for me.

===subject:CA: survivor
===message:These are the people I chose to survive and why (in order of most wanted to least):
*usability is my most highly rated component in a person
1. Mr. Newton - young, smart, healthy, ability to help others become healthy, able to reproduce, not racist, and has plenty of medical knowledge
2. Father Frans - most likely healthy and able to help with many things, has morals, can help others with issues, can become a leader, not racist, farming knowledge is very important, he may not help with reproduction because he is a catholic priest but he is able to reproduce if he choses
3. Mr. Blake - basically i only want him because he has knowledge in construction and is handy, otherwise i would throw him out. so yes, i rate usability as extremely important.
4. Dr. Dane - good health, establish political settings when needed, knowledgable, perhaps a leader
5. Mary Evans - young, can reproduce, trade school education, can probably think "outside of the box", artistic (creative)
6. Mrs. Clark - also able to reproduce, engineering background will help with problem-solving issues, educated, involved in zero population growth so presumably okay with presenting her views on things
7. Mrs. Dane - basically she is useful because she is a counselor. this will probably be needed, especially with the differences in racial beliefs among the group i've picked. she can mediate and help people sort through issues.

This week I researched magazines in the library and found one that I think will work well with my topic. I am in the process of checking out the magazine further and making sure it has the audience I want. Othewise, I have been reading up on my subject and I trying to gain a better understanding of both sides of my argument.

Affirmative action selects students based on race rather than qualifications.

pity - feeling sorry for someone's unhappiness

4. good teacher - connects with students (interested in subject and kids, makes concerted effort to make a connection), knowledgable - knows their information, up to date, relates it well

===message:This week i located the journal i'm going to send my essay to, "The Woman Today". i went to the dinner and public presentation of Eleanor Clift on wednesday. i gained some insight into the effects of media on politics today, especially on the web, and how this could effect a woman rumming for the presidency in the future. i hadn't considered that side of my argument yet, the media helping a woman run for president, but i think it is very interesting and could possibly be a very strong argument in my essay.
