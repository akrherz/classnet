===subject:Hack Q#1&2 (9/9)
===message:1. It is not alright to have pre-marital sex, It is wrong for a society to promote sex, Yale has posters & signs in it's dormatories that makes it sound like they assume every collge student has sex/
2. That he shouldn't have to live in the dorms. It is a rule that all freshman & sophomore students live in the dorms their first year. Yes, living in the dorms the first years of college help a student to adjust to the new format of education.

===subject:Jacoby Q 1&2 (9/9)
===message:1. It depends on the students priorities. If he/she chooses to catch up on popular culture rather then catch up on studies so be it. I mean if you force a kid to study they aren't going to get much out of it. They have to want to learn the stuff.
2. He is definately for the MCAS. I also think he is saying that kids have to know facts for their educational part of life, and they have to know facts for their social part of life.

===subject:Patterson Q 1-4 9/23
===message:1) The claim is stated in the first paragraph. Very clearly stated.
2) The white minority?, Census reports accurate
3) Sustain racist fears of white supremacist, affect views of ordinary whites.
4) Different kinds of support can be equally persuasive. Political analysis would be the easiest to challenge because history and stats are actual facts from the past and present while political analysis is assumptions made from the facts.

===subject:Beauty Contest Q 8e 9/23
===message:I don't think beauty contests are degrading to women. If anything they are degrading to men. Do you ever see an all male beauty contest? If the even do exist do you ever see one on national television. Furthermore, female beauty contests make women look good. They show that women can be beautiful and intellectual.
