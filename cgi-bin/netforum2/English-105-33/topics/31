===more:1. Hack wants the same permission to live off campus that Yale gives anybody else.  His religion is against inter-sex dorms being that close together so he'd rather live on his own and not worry about it.  I think that is what he is trying to say.  He doesn't feel that it's a moral environment or surrounding he can call home.  He feels that "we cannot live in a place where women are permitted to stay overnight in men’s rooms, and where visiting men can traipse through the common halls on the women’s floors”

2. “Yale ought to reflect on and reappraise a policy that compels us to compromise our religious principles.”  They refuse to consider this because they already think Yale’s colleges carry a moral meaning.  I believe Yale’s rules are justified but you should have a choice of where you can live at.  If someone’s uncomfortable in the dorms, let them have other options.
