===subject:CA: Hack Qs 1&2 9/9
===message:(1.)  Hack’s moral code is to not have sex in college.  He believes that sex before marriage is immoral.

(2.)  Hack proposes that the rules be changed to accommodate him and allow him to live off campus.  Yale most likely refuses this idea because it is ridiculous.  Policies shouldn’t need to be changed to accommodate one person, or five people, especially considering that this is a private university.  If it was a public university, I could understand the problem, however it is not.  It is difficult enough to get into Yale, but then to complain about it?  Hack think about where he’s at.  He needs them a lot more than they need him.  Needless to say, Yale is completely justified in not changing the rules.

===message:(1.)  I don’t think this paper makes a strong argument.  It argues that guys memorize sports statistics.  I hate sports and know nothing of them.  I couldn’t tell you the rules for one game, let alone the team rosters.  I’ve also never taken particular attention to popular media of any type, nor popular clothing styles.  And you’d have to plug your ears every time you walked by a radio to not know who Fred Durst is, and honestly have no idea who Carson Daily is, so that argument is also faulty.  So far I don’t see any good arguments that students can memorize useless facts.  Maybe it works for some, but I’m not convinced.

(2.)  The author is obviously for the MCAS, since he argues that students can memorize useless information, particularly when he says “if the argument is that teenagers cannot meet rigorous standards of knowledge or memorize all kinds of “irrelevant” details, it is easily refuted.”  So far this has been very unpersuasive because of two reasons:  first, I know one of his list of irrelevant facts (sports stats, team rosters, fashion trends, music and TV trivia), and most importantly because the facts that kids are expected to memorize for the MCAS are completely irrelevant when it comes to real life.  No one is ever going to ask why Henry IV issued the Edict of Nantes, or most of the other useless information contained on the test.  School should be about learning and preparing for life afterwards, not memorizing useless facts.

===message:(1.)  That gas heat is unsafe for your home and for your children.  It may be justified, but it is doubtful that there are a significant number of deaths due to gas heating problems each year, so most likely it is unjustified.

(2.)  You would have to do research into statistics of fires and accidents related to gas heat and those related to oil heat, and then compare the findings.

===message:Beauty contests are not degrading to women.  The women who participate in them choose to do so, and are not forced to.  Also some women are able to achieve higher self-esteem through participation in beauty contests.
