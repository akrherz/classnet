===subject:CA: Hack,Q. 1 and 2, 9-9-03
===message:1. Hacks moral code is that women shouldn't be aloud to stay in man's rooms and men souldn't be allowed to trail up and down women's hallways looking for trouble. The author believes their needs to be certian rules for behavior of students living on campus in respect for others who must live there as well. An ex. of conduct is Yale's residential colleges carry a moral meaning "Anything Goes." 2. The solution the Author proposes is the right for junior status students should not be required to stay in the dorms. The author would much rather live off campus so he is away from this behavior of students around him. Hack believes it is not right for a twentyone year old who is not married but with freshmen or sophmore status should not have to live on campus. I would have to agree with the author in this case. It isn't right for the college to suck the students for as much money as they can get for as long as they can.

===subject:CA: Jacoby, Q. 1 and 2, 9-9-03
===message:1. The strongest evidence in support of this artile claim of the fact that students can master information in the MCAS, is that students are already performing these tasks for the MCAS everyday. Boys and girls today are given test by their peers to learn about all kinds of subjects, for example football teams, singers,names of songs, fashion trends,etc. In the third paragraph it states that kids today are more brtal when it coems to knowing about sports or music. 2. I don't think this person's attitude is very persuasive. It sounds as if the person is whining. The author makes it seem as though all other subjects are less imortant and facts about music and sports are more convenience.

===message:1. This ad's strong emotional appeal is that in order to get service s from a gas company you have to say "I smell gas" this ad is probably justified b/c gas co. sould always be giving  proper services; not just when there is a problem. 
2. The appeal would be when the customer says " I smell gas" that would make anyonw nervous.

===subject:Q. 1-3 ad pg. 221
===message:1. Advantages of natural gas this ad stresses is that natural gas will protect the enviornment;it is cleaner than other fossil fules. Using butterflies isn't a good example, should use trees or amimals.
2. using butterflies to persuade readers, in order to perchase natural gas. 
3. ad on 188 is stronger, knowing that one ad is positive, nd the other negative doesn't change much . ad on 188 is easier to understand, and is an eye catcher.

I plan on interviewing my mom because she is a teacher of fifteen years and has taught all ages, so she would know a lot about sex and violence. I also think if some one would have time at planed parenthood... to see if I can interview someone there. I have an appointment with you tomorrow Friday at 11:00. SO I am making some progress.
