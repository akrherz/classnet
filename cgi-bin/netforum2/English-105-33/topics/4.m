===message:3. Hooks should be allowed to play football for Iowa State. This was an interesting article partly because I am a huge fan of cyclone football. It was interesting because I was unaware of Hook's current status with ISU. I believe it was written with two different ideas in mind. That Hooks should now be able to play and that all student athletes should be punished.

===subject:EA-Hacks 1&2, Jacoby's1&2
===message:1.Hacks moral code as he puts it is to follow "the principles of judism lived according to the Torah and 3.000 year old rabbinic teachings" Hack goes on to give examples of what the dorms are like based on his observations and from Yale publications. "We cannot in good conscience live in a place where women stay overnight in mens rooms and where men can traysse through the common halls on the women's floors"
2. The student wishes to live off campus with his parents. Yale does not accept because they have a policy requiring all freshmen and sophomores to reside on campus. In this situation I do not believe Yale is justified. They are as the author puts it imposing their own morality and religion on these students who do not wish to live on campus.
1. I believe the authors strongest point is actually his first. The author presents the young teenage boy who must memorize facts about the sports teams to fit in with the right people. This example is clear and lenthy in it's assertion that teens already memorize pointless facts. Why not make them memorize facts that could prove useful at some point. The MCAS test includes an enormous amount of information much of which is irrelevant or so specialized that many adults do not know it. It also devalues technical, linguistic, musical, athletic and vocational skills that cannot be assessed on a standardized test. This statement has many fine points. First its too much for students to remember, second it discounts other areas of competency. Very straight forward and to the point. The author, however, goes not to refute all the arguments set forth by this group.
2. The author likes to quote others when making points. His straight forward approach in presenting what exactly students do memorize and know is very effective in one aspect of persuasion. It makes the reader believe that high school students can memorize all that is required to pass the MCAS but the author never crossed the barrier into school students.

===subject:CA: Patterson 1-4
===message:1.In recent weeks, reporting and commentary that misinterpret census results have been persistently misinforming the nation about it's ethnic and racial composition.
2. In any case, the suggestion that the white population is fast on its way to becoming a minority is a minority is a gross distortion. The misleading reports of white proportional decline are likely not only to sustain the racist fears of white supremacist groups but also to affect the views of ordinary white, nonextremist Americans one is the policy of the census bureau itself. Which does not effectively classify citizens.
3. They can futher white supremacy groups as well as worry non extreme whites.
4. I think statistics and political analysis are equally as persuasive. They are current, which makes them easy to challenge because they change with great frequency.

===message:1. This ad appeals to a sense of security and family. They want you to think of your family and how gas can poison and kill hence you should use oil not gas. I believe in some situations this appeal is justified. Gas can kill people. However, it's cheap and effecient. Gas if installed correctly can be the safest form of heat. Also, gas has smell added to it so people will know there is a leak.
2. One could research statistics in gas deaths and how frequent they actually are. This could verify the validity of the claim.

===subject:Question 8e
===message:8e. Beauty contests are degrading to women. This stereotype exists partly because it is somewhat degrading to women. Women are subjected to mass viewing while they prance around a stage wearing practically nothing. They are like cattle which judges view and pick the best one. However, it has been said that one can only degrade you if you let them. That makes it relative or applicable to every person. If the women in these pagents feel it is an uplifing experience then perhaps it is.

===subject:CA:Questions 1-6 Goodman
===message:1. university views, history of tests, objectors to tests, students reality
2. I think the end statement about students cheating on the tests thus making tests not an accurate view of students overall intelligence is one of his stronger arguments. He indicates this argument over and over by backing it up over and over with evidence and different points of view.
3.I believe Goodman calls upon those universities because they are prestigious and leaders in the world of education and they set the standards by which all other universities will follow.
4. The author reveals his purpose in the following statements: "I think that the great majority of professors agree that grading hinders teaching and creates a bad spirit, going as far as cheating and plagiarizing." "A miserable effect of grading is to nullify the various uses of testing." "Many students are lazy, so teachers try to goad or threaten them by grading. In the long run this must do more harm than good. Laziness is a character-defense." 
5. Goodman reply's to the professors statement of "I think that the great majority of professors agree that grading hinders teaching and creates a bad spirit, going as far as cheating and plagiaring" Then, Goodman goes on to say, "It is uniformyl asserted, however, that the grading is inevitable; for how else will the graduate schools, the foundations, the corporations know whom to accept, reward, hire? How will the talent scouts know whom to tap?"  Goodman responds to this assertion that it is inevitable by saying, "By testing the applicants, of course, according to the specific task requirements of  the inducting institution, just as applicants for the Civil Service or for licenses in medicine, law, and architecture are tested."
6. Goodman thinks the real purpose of testing should be to test specific task requirements of the inducting institution. He says "grading is to nullify the various uses of testing, for both student and teacher is a means of structuring, and also of finding out what is blank or wrong and what has been assimilated and can be taken for granted. The aim is to discover weakness, what is the point of down-grading and punishing it, and thereby inviting the student to conceal his weakness, by faking and bulling, if not cheating?"

===message:1. The advantages of natural gas this ad stresses are that of saving the environment and saving beauty. I believe butterflies are superior to plants or other animals as persuasive elements, because they are very beautiful in flight around in the wild. They are fragile in that they are easily killed or harmed. Other animals are more able to adapt to a changing environment than butterflies who cannot live under temperature changes. There is also a great variety of them and almost everyone has seen or touched a butterfly at some point in his or her life.
2. The adds warrant or assume that the user is concerned about the environment and their impact on the environment. That they value beautiful things such as butterflies.
3.I believe the add on page 188 is stronger than the add on page 221 becuase 188 appeals to human life. Where as 221 appeals to the environment. It would depend on what you value as a person. I believe most people value human life over animal hence making 188 a stronger appeal. I don't believe that because 188 is negative it changes my decision. I actually didn't realize it was negative until I really read all of the fine print. They were both very effective adds for me. I value both the environment and keeping my family safe. However. when it comes down to it. I have to decide on what is cheapest :(
