===message:My table was one the came to a consensus on their decision but in retrospect there is a single change i would make.  
a)Dr Dane would stay because of his good health and intelect.  He could also be used to establish some type or leadership/order afterwards because of his interest in politics.  
b)Mrs. Dane would not stay.  She is obese and diabetic and in a survival situation those are things that are not very helpful to you.  And depending on the type of diabetes she has it would be possible that she could pass this on to the next generation therebye lessening their chances of survival.  
c)Bobby is where i differ from my group.  I would get rid of Bobby.  I do this not because of his mental retardation but because of his age.  And i also needed to open up a slot for someone else.  
d)Mrs. Garcia would stay because she is a child bearing age and is this situation that is a very good thing.  
e)Jean is staying because she will be the start of the next generation.  She will be roughly the same age as any other children and will eventually grow up and be able to have children.  
f)Mary Evans is staying mostly for her age and trade school education.  I don't know what it is but i will assume that it is something that would be useful.  
g)Mr. Newton is staying because he is young and in very good health.  He is in his last year of med school so he could serve as a doctor for the survivors.  As for has the suspected homsexual activity i think that given the situation it wouldn't be a problem.  
h)Mrs. Clark is also staying beacuse she is young and can bear children.  She is the daughter of a minister and has a college education so she would be well versed in many things.  
i)Mr. Blake will not be kept around.  He is old because of his antiblack views would not get along with several of the other people that are staying.  
j)I decided to change my vote of Father Frans and keep him.  He is young and healthy and also has farming background, a necessity in this situation.  
k)Dr. Gonzales will not be staying.  He is in his sixties and has already had 2 heart attacks in the past five years. Combine those 2 things and they make for a very bad combination in a survival situation.
