===more:I have a question about the Middle East.  If they can control most of the world's oil production, which America depends on, how the U.S. can control basicly the oil prices?  I mean when the U.S. stepped in during the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, why couldn't Iraq build the military tectnology/war factories, to build a force to be able to defend its actions?  And the U.S.,  who needs the oil form Iraq for years, be able to get ahead in military tectnology to kick (the 5th largest army in the world) in the butt. Shouldn't Iraq be able to afford to have the same or more money to build the same type of facilities to build up to the U.S. military?  Iraq may not have the resources as the U.S. does but can't they afford to have it bought and shipped in?  Don't get me wrong, I happy that Iraq was stopped, but it didn't look that hard to do.

===message:I don't know if this is going to make sense, but let me give
it a try.  First, I want to say that I'm kind of talking in
general terms, not just about the Gulf War.  I think that a
lot of why Iraq and the Middle East does not try to achieve
the same level of technology/defense/army/etc. that Western
nations have (you gave the example of the US, but there is
also Russia, Great Britain) is because they want to be 
guaranteed "protection" and "support" from nations such as
the US.  Yes, the US will look out for our oil interests,
and yes, we have to "protect democracy", but I think that
the Middle East countries are very careful when dealing with
us.  First, they won't, on purpose, build an army that might
make the US feel concerned or threatened.  How far do you 
think the US would go if it was going to loose its dominant
control of the Middle East oil market?  Would we go as far
as a complete takeover of Iran/Iraq/etc?  I believe that the
Middle East would rather remain as they are than risk the
wrath of the US.  Their armies are the 5th largest in the
world, and if we had not stepped in into the Gulf, I believe
Kuwait would have been taken over.  Also, the Middle East is
saving up tons of monies in oil sales, and it doesn't see
an oil shortage happening in the near future, so why rock
that boat.  Iran/Iraq/etc. may also feel that they might 
gain an advantage over peoples (like the Israelis) if they
continue being "friendly" with the US.  Now the US has its
standards concerning protecting democracy, human rights, etc.
but from history we see that it always is good to be a "friend"
of the US's.  Right now, I don't see why countries like Iraq
and Iran would want to rock their boat that lies in US waters
-- economically and politically at least.  This still leaves
some unanswered questions concerning the Gulf War, but it also
leaves out the strong religious beliefs of Islam.

===message:	WHy do we have the temptation of leaving Africa behind? Although superficially,we also talked about Africa (sub-saharan) when discussing the issues facing the "OTHER WORLD".  To me the use of "Other World" rather than "DEVELOPING COUNTRIES" is very questionable. It is a very biased term to use in class named "INTERNATIONAL STUDIES". Labeling those as the Other World just creates more barrier and divergence among the countries. If this is the case why do Americans bother doing business with these" Other world"countries? Why are you in Angola, South Africa, Israel, CHina, Hong Kong, Brasil just to name a few? It is time to stop these  bullshit and narrow minded. WE all live in a World of complimentarity. Every country has arole to play in this big picture. But this is not the main reason why I am here. I am here wondering why Sub-Saharan does not figure in the list of topics for discusion? Belaruss is there but not Africa even as a whole. My god this awful sad.
