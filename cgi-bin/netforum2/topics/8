===more:The question I'd like you to ponder is why do we talk about "Latin America"? Is it coherent or is it so varied that you can't generalize about the place at all?

===message:Latin America can be condisered on place, as long as we can consider Mexico, US, and Canada one place.  But, I think that a southern spanish speaking person and a northern french speaking person would strongly disagree.  To the outsider, I am sure,  Latin America does appear as one place.  But to an outsider, Europe also appears to them as one place.  The same goes for Africa and Asia.  Perhaps it is better economically and politically to appear as one place.  Isn't that the goal of the European Union?

===message:I think using the single term of Latin America conveys a homogenity that falls short of a true description of the area, in the same way as Europe does. Although I have a limited knowledge of the region, I think you have to think of it as "many" places. There are so many differences that exist between the different nations: geographic, climatic, ethnic, economic, political, etc..  I suppose the ease in referring to the region as one entity stems from the fact that  it is continuous, with most nations connected (exception being island nations of the Caribbean.) Also, there is the commonality of the Romance languages that are spoken there. Is that where the label of "Latin" comes from?

===message:I think Latin America consider as many places, because there are differences in ethnic, language, and culture around the area.  The geographical region is different too.  Some countries in this area view differently on the polical and encomonic matter.  There even some tension between different countries around this area.  If Latin America view as one place, than Asia would view as one place too.  Everybody know Asia is not a one place because same reason as in Latin America that I just mention.  Another example would be Canada. You got mostly the French in the upper middle of Canada.

===message:I definitely agree that Latin America is a place of great diversity and unique culture, but so is as earlier stated the United States.  The streets of Ames Iowa are quite a different place than the streets of New Orleans.  I personally think that the way the U.S. continues to struggle with diversity is a model for the rest of the world.  I don't think that we (U.S.) has handled it very well in the past, but we as well as the rest of the world can learn from our mistakes and take up the torch from here.  I think Nationalism is a strong and traditionally a very militaristic movement, and I think the only way to combat it is to cherish and celebrate the unique qualities of everyone while at the same time try to establish a way of life that will benifit all people and incorporate many.  So Latin America is a varied and unique place, but I think that if we can establish the common goals and at the same time retain some diversity Latin America could and should be a tremendously successful, diverse place possibley in the future the model for others to follow.

===message:I think that the peoples of Latin America would hang their jaws open in surprise that we are discussing this.  Yes, the countries of Latin America--many of them, anyway--share a common past of being visited and overrun by the conquistadors in the sixteenth and seventeenth century.  Many of the citizens of these countries, then, have some European heritage to them.  But why use this European event to judge whether or not Latin America is many places or few?  Before the Europeans came there were also hundreds of different civilizations and existence (and that had already fallen).  Like the nations of Native Americans that lived in this country before English and French settlers came, the indigenous people of Latin America were flourishing without the knowledge that there was anyone else across the oceans (or perhaps they may have known [?]).  Simply staring at a globe one may say that yes, South America is one continent, and since Latin America is mostly made up of South America, it is one place in that respect.  When one is talking of the people, the cultures, the climate (social and weather related!) Latin America is a place of many.

===message:I feel that humans have a tendency to put every piece of information into a nice neat category.  Such is the case with diverse regions with many countries and cultures.  Latin america is a label that is applied to that particular part of the world.  It doesn't mean that there is any disrespect directecd towards its people because we are lumping everyone together and calling them Latin Americans.  The same holds true for every other country in the world.  People may not know where exactly Bekarus is located on the map but they would know that it was part of the Soviet Union.  It is important that we do not get caught up in semantics when discussing these things.  Latin America is one place and many countries.
