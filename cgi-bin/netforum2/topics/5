===message:	I believe English can clearly be considered the universal language in the present age.  Because there is a need for all countries to communicate in a single language.  
This is evident by the fact that many countries require students to learn English in school.  The countries that don't are mainly already developed countries like France.  Even then, English is offered as an optional language class.  The Universality 
of English can be traced to more than just the bussness or the communicational aspect.  The pop culture which is very attractive to teens all around the globe get a natural 'want' to know more Engligh.  Even in 'closed' countries such as China and 
North Korea are forcing and encouraging its people to learn the language due to the ever greater need for communication with the rest of the world.  Although the majority of the world's people don't speak english at the present time, I believe they 
will in the future.  Mainly to keep from drouning in an ever changing global society which had chosen English as it's language.  I believe this has taken place because of a form of Soft Pressure being applied to all countries of the world by major powers 
such as the United States which uses English.  So, inorder to keep up with the 'States, all others are addapting the American Game Plan.
