===message:In my opinion, I think that sweatshops are a good way in 
helping other countries out.  I mean if we are trying to help them, whats wrong
with sweatshops. It gives them a place to work, it gives them income, and it gives them
a life. Again, who are we to judge if there working conditions are 
so terrible.  In the U.S. it is considered wrong to work that long and
for the amount there getting, but I think they are very happy and lucky to get a 
job no matter how bad Americans see the conditions.

===message:I think sweatshops is good in a way and is also bad in a 
way.  The good is that it give people job, income, and life.
The bad is that the owner of the sweatshop is ripping the 
workers off.  The workers is paying way less than minimum wages
that is requirer.  The hours they work is intensive and
with no break at all.  Also the condition they are working
in.  It's unfit for them and there are many sately violation
code that have been broken.  I think the government should do something more
about it to improve or change the way how sweatshops are operating
in this country.  If all the condition is change and improve,
I will definely agree that sweatshops are good and I will
have no problem with it all.

===message:In order for America to keep its standard of living so high,
it is only reasonable to use the cheapest possible labor
so that we can make as much profit as we can.  What people
do not realize is sweatshops provide America with our standard
of living.  The clothes we buy, the shoes we wear, and more 
recently, the computer parts are being made over seas so that
Americans can purchase these goods and keep some excess money
for savings.  

Although, since most sweatshops are not American owned, we
do not have the power to regulate how the workers are treated.
the only power we have is, since American contracts are so
large, is to threaten to break these contracts with sweatshop
owners we feel are not treating thier employees fairly, and
find other means of cheap labor.  If we do break these contracts,
then the community in which we provided these opportunites
are completely wiped out.  Therefore, either we use expensive
American labor to produce our goods and keep all of our money
for ourselves, or we provide opportunites for the world to
earn some of our money.

===message:Although the commentary we read on sweatshops had an effective arguement in terms of giving developing countries a start, I still have a little trouble with a couple of aspects. I suppose I can understand the low wage and the necessity of children contributing to the family's income.  However, some of the reports of  conditions and treatment that come out in the media sound utterly  inhumane. Surely with the power and influence the US has, something could be done. I'm a little curious if anyone in the class has a problem with Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods and their 40mil $ contracts with Nike? Most of the comments in this discussion seem to be pretty pro-sweatshop. Was the commentary we read for class that effective?

===message:I think that if the U.S. is going to set up factories in other
countries then the heads of the company should somehow see how
the operations are working.  I think that the companies who do
hire people overseas to make sure that they are being paid a 
little more and make sure that the conditions of the plant are
worthy of an American to work there.  I feel that is up to the
company to make sure that the workers are being treated fairly
and not the government of the U.S.  The companies are responsible
for their workers environment in the U.S. they should also be responsible for
the work conditions of all of their plants no matter where they
happen to be at.

===message:I agree with the articles thesis that sweatshop type labor is
in many ways a nessessary building block for developing world economies
The United States started out the same way and look where we
are now economically.  The artile stated that a sweatshop in 
Honduras worked children 75 hours a week for only 33 cents an 
hour.  But if the economy of the country is in such poor shape
than that could be enought to live off of in that country.  Its
all realative to the standards of living in the individual countries.

===message:I believe that sweatshops are a necessay evil for developing countries to survive in the global market.  It is necessary for a country to struggle before it can actually get ahead, through trial and error does a nation sometimes learn to get ahead.  With that comes personal sacrifices of individuals needs and wants for the good of the whole.  A lesson of history will tell you that all developed countries in the world have gone through economic and political hardships before coming into there own goals.  War and poverty are sometimes necessary pains for a country to have before it learn how to overcome its own diverse problems.  Sweatshops are just another lesson of life to some nations. It must learn to under go difficulties before it has a chance to get ahead.  Its people must be willing to not be exploited but to have the ability for self reliance even if it takes years to build; it must have the ability to take its first step through often unfair practices in hard labor.  No one said life was fair, a country has to realize that to often its people will have to suffer in order to get anywhere.

===message:I agree with the article that such manual labor as seen in
sweatshops are a necessary evil in the development of industry.
I think back to my history lessons, and remember hearing about
many different countries that have used sweatshops.  Probably 
over 90% of the world has used or is using something like a
sweatshop at some point in industrial development.  Now with
the trend of human rights, OSHA, and people who call for better
working conditions and wages for manual laborers, I think that
that is why so much is being made of not letting sweatshop 
conditions continue.  But look at who is doing the complaining.
It is the highly developed West.  I agree with many people that
there should be standard work conditions, and laborers should
not have to worry about dying on the job, and there should be
some safety standards; also the US companies that have their
own Other World sweatshops could help in making these standards.
But I believe that the West should back off and quit throwing its
own temper tantrum, and take a look at its own history.  Look
at the stages of development that we went through in becoming
highly developed and technologically advanced, and see if we
can see those same stages of development in newly developing
countries.  I guarantee that sweatshops are included in one
of those stages.  So if we can collectively set a few basic
standards, then we should just let the natural development take
its course.

===message:I going out on a limb here but I don't think sweatshops are 
necessarily bad.  I don't look at them that way.  I look at them as an opportunity for the unfortunate people that could be homeless without these jobs to get a chance at life.  I have a friend that works at a meat packing plant that I know wouldn't work there if he could get a job somewhere else but one time of messing with the law and getting caught, and you are doomed to sweatshop jobs.  Of course you might not be very sympathetic to these type of people and in that case, there are people that do have to put their children to work so that they can feed them.  They aren't trying to be cruel.  They are just the type of people that got very few breaks in life and are trying to make the most out of a bad situation.  For those sweatshops that really are like slave work, I feel sorry for them, but what are the alternatives?
