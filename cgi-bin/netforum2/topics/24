===message:I was thinking back to a day in class.  We were discussing pretty much the topic of inferiority, and how a black man in a class room feels weird around other people not like him.  No offense to him in any way.  I believe that some of these feelings are in a person's psychosis though.  I have a lot of black friends and they are always saying that everyone is staring at them but yet when I am around them.  Yes, people look at us, but it definitely isn't a stare and they could just as easily be looking at me, as them.  I just believe that some things aren't really what people make them out to be at all yet I realize that discrimination and these staring problems are a reality for a lot of black people.  I feel bad as a white person that black people don't think that we like them when we do.  We all are having inferiority complexes and it seems to be very hard to stop the cycle.  Many have tried and failed.  Then this thing with Catt Hall has also came up over the last year and I just think that maybe everyone should some how let bygones be bygones.  Mary Chapin Catt did say racial things, but she also fought for women's suffrage.  With the Catt Hall situation, I just felt like it caused a lot of commotion to get relations with each other nowhere.  I know if I was black I would probably have had a little different views.  But why can't we all live in the present intead of going back so far in the past and stirring up things so much.   There are many great people in our history that made prejudiced remarks toward people and they atill have buildings greater than Catt Hall being named after them.  Why isn't there consistency?  There were no fights there.
