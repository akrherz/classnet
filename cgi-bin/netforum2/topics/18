===more:Should employers be given stronger penalties for providing cheap labor which bring most of the illegal aliens in to the U.S.?  Or should there be stronger laws to deal with people slipping into the states to find work in these businesses that will allow them?

===message:In the case of illegal aliens, why not just make everybody legal.  What could it hurt?  Until the US becomes a strong police state, I believe, that there will always be illegal aliens.  They can work and pay taxes, even social secuity taxes.  I'm sure that the baby boomers will enjoy that.

===message:I do not think illegal aliens should be admitted into our 
country without going through the government.  They do not 
pay taxes and even if they did, how would we be able to 
make them pay taxes like everyone else?  We would not even
be able to keep track of who was working in the U.S. anyway.
They come and work yet they take their earnings home.  They are
not putting anything back into the community in which they
profit.

===message:I don't see illegal aliens as a big problem in this country.  First, we must remember that many of our own ancestors came to the United States searching for better opportunities:  jobs, money, freedom.  These are the same things that illegal aliens are looking for.  Also, these people will work jobs that most Americans won't.  Work like meat packing and produce harvesting is still needed in the United States, and until these can be more automated, immigrants can definetly be useful.  Let's show some compassion;  illegal aliens are people, too and deserve the same opportunities that many of our ancestors had and that we take for granted.

===message:    Illegal aliens are people too and have very good reason to 
try and sneak into this country, they have families to support
and lives to try and maintain. Sneaking into this country 
isn't exactly something you would choose to do for a weekend 
trip. Having grown up in southern Arizona and having a mother
that worked in an Emergency department at a hospital, I heard
the horror stories that these people endured. People shot and
killed by boarder patrol, drowning or getting stuck and 
killed in quick sand in the Colorodo river, being trapped in 
the middle of the desert without water and having to drink 
your own urine in order not to die of dehydration, tetnus, 
venomous animals (black widows, brown recluses, rattle snakes,
gila monsters) whereever you look, the list of things that
illegal immagrants endure in order to come into this country
just goes on and on, and many don't make it. When you're able
to look at it objectively and eliminate the fact that these
are real live people suffering, it's easy to say illegal
immagrants should just be sent back, but these are feeling 
individuals not just statistics. They have the right to try
and make it here. America was based on people that were
fighters, yet now that we've gotten what we fought for, it 
seems that we're unwilling to share the rewards with those 
that are now fighting for the exact same things.
