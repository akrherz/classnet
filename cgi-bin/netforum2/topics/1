===more:The June 8 New York Times Magazine is dedicated to how the world sees the U.S.
Why! How does the world see the United States?
Why is the U.S. "Inescapable" as the article I assigned you
suggests?

===message:I personally think that the article in the magazine seems
incomplete.  It seems as if the author is just showing the 
signs of Western/American influence, and then states why and 
how, without much look at the mentality of the people who
are embracing "our" culture or the history behind this.  This 
world is constatly 
changing and it seems that in history the nations that are 
doing well are picked out as models and the less fortunate
countries try and mimic those models.  I think that the phenomenon 
is obvious. If you see what sort of things from other
cultures pasts are still here today or have created an impact.
The culture of Europe during Imperialism set the standards 
for proper culture during that time because of Europes 
wealth and power.  Examples of that are tea time followed in many
many of the cultures effected by the English.  An even more
universal and obvious example is the way christianity spread
over the entire world.  Other nations adopted some of that 
culture, partially by force because of invasion by the stronger
powers, but also because all nations seem to have a desire to suceed 
and support the high standards of living that they see are possible  
in the powerful countries.  It just seems to me that the 
current trend is just another cycle with a new "have" 
model that the "have-nots" want to mimic, and not some new
and modern phenomenon.  The article seems to me to make it
sound like this is such a new and innovative happening when
it seems to me to just be a continuation of a historic 
trend.

===message:How The World Sees Us - Like we talked about in class, in 
previous decades the world has viewed the US as a political
"Big Bully."  Today other cultures are beginning to feel
threatened by the growing pop culture influences that are
spreading into all corners of the world.  I see in the future
the US being viewed as a cultural "Big Bully" -- not by 
individual people, necessarily, but by governments and traditional
institutions.  For example, not only in the US having major
influence through TV, movies, food, and music, but what about human
rights.  The US has always emphasized basic human rights, and that
is influencing individuals and groups in other cultures to push
for those same rights, despite it being a major part of their
cultures.   Will the US be seen as being too pushy on topics
other than pop culture, which is really very materialistic? Topics
concerning values and beliefs, which are a large part of what
makes up a culture.  A Chechnyan soldier wearing a Chicago Bull's
stocking cap is a good picture of the influence of the US on the 
materialistic culture, but I believe that the influence on the US
runs much deeper -- maybe not as noticable, but just as important.
Governments of other cultures already feel threatened by the
overwelming materialistic culture of producers/consumers, but
will we see more and more concern and then later more limitations
being placed on Americana when the deeper influences become more 
noticable?

===message:This comment is regarding the U.S. influence on culture, not necessarily on science and technolgy.If the French and the German governments get a little antsy when our language and style starts to creep into theirs, good for them. Frankly, if the American "culture" is proliferating throughout the rest of the world as the NYT mag implies, there should be concern. One need only look at the homogenization of our own society. You could practically place someone on any intersection in any urban area in the U.S. and the view would be the same: Walmarts, McDonalds, convenience stores, and strip malls. It would be tragic to be able to make the same statement regarding any urban area in the world. It seems to me that the attraction to having things "American," is an attraction to having things period. Since the U.S. is the model of consumption, and its images are constantly saturating the media, it seems natural that others would want it too. I think the "rest of the world" should be wary of these wants. I doubt however, that this sprawl of consumerism will subside.Also, I completely agree with Mr. Faux's analysis with the "have / have nots"

===message:	The United States has and always will be the rebel of the New World.  It seems like everything that it does is not good enough for its citizens and other countries.  If other countries are interested in American fads is that America's fault?  I don't think that is.  The United States was based on personal freedoms and open-mindedness.  What is interesting is that this open-mindedness also leads to extreme amounts of criticism.  It is not our foreign policy to force Nike shoes on the rest of the world.  We are giving countries freedom to decide what will work and what won't in there own countries.  We are not here to judge other countries and say that it is sad that they are dipping into American pop culture.  That is their buisness.  What is upsetting to me is that the same people that are picking at the U.S. are not doing anything to help out around here.  It is really easy for people to sit back and pick apart everything that this country stands for like freedom and yet go home and enjoy its rewards.  Yes maybe other countries are losing a little of their own culture and replacing it with America's pop culture but maybe that is because the people in those other countries are starting to enjoy the things that we as Americans have taken for granted.

===message:Veering off topic a bit, something that was said in class the other day struck a nerve of sorts--English as a universal language of sorts.  None of us are in a bubble; we all know that English is a fairly world-wide language.  Many people speak it as their native tongue.  Most people would consider it educated to be able to speak a variety of languages, as most international politicians do.  Let me ask this question, though: when was the last time we had a bilingual president?  Is this a sign of pure American snobbery or just our practice of isolationism that has gone on for decades?  
     And just what is this burst of American culture and (though often somewhat reluctant) international support for the "American Way"?  What will this do to Americans?  Does this signal a resurgance of patriotism or will America as a country get a swollen head?  Who's to tell...

None of us live in a bubble; all of us are aware that to "get anywhere" in business and politics, one has to learn English.  And, many people around the world do speak it as their native tongues.  What is this a result of?  Is it a product of colonial days when countless regions of the world were under British control and therefore much business was dealt in English?  Why do so many know it, and are forced to know it to "get ahead"?  Many international politicians know several languages, yet when was the last time we had a president to who could converse with fellow leaders in their native tongues?  Is this a sign of American snobbery, laziness, or just is it that Americans are cashing in on the world-wide use of English?  
Also, what does this burst of culture and (often somewhat reluctant) praise of the American way overseas?  Will this result in a resurgence of American patriotism, or swell the head of America a bit more?  Is our way REALLY best out of them all, or just best for right now????

===message:Some German of Greek, I really don't  remember, believed that new ideas are not new concepts, but rather improvement upon existing ideas.  The same, I  believe, goes for societes and sultures.  Yes, the United States has a hugh influenze over other societes of the world.  Is this influzence dostroying or adding llife to the other societies?  As long as the other societies borrow only certain points of the US culture (?), I believe that this is the natural way of things.  I think that, when another tries to be ecactly  like someone else, it is the sema as closing oneself off completely  from the rest of the world, and is just as unbenefical.  A past example, of another dominate society in the world, would be the Roman Empire.  How many of us today know and use Latin words?
