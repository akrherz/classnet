Why! How does the world see the United States?
Why is the U.S. "Inescapable" as the article I assigned you
suggests?

===message:The U.S. is most definitely the world power.  No we don't possess the smartest people on earth, nor the fastest, although that can be disputed-case in point-Gail Devors and Michael Johnson.  We don't have the most people in the world either.  Heck, we don't even have the most money in the world.  What we got is power, and boy do we got it.  How many countries do you know of that can go defend any country in the world and come out of it without this country blowing us up? Courage is also a word that we have.  We also have the resources.  Yes, it appears that we are in debt up to our eye balls, but we can trade with the best of them.  All is achieved through power.  We have respect of other countries because we demand it.  We get to be the center of every battle because we get right in the middle of it.  We are able to come and go as we please because nobody wants us as an enemy.  Don't get me wrong, it definitely isn't for centimental reasons.  Our entire country is kind of like those people that you meet through life that you put up with because you think well they might make something of themselves, but otherwise you can't stand them.  Personally, I think that power should be equally distributed so our country can be well liked instead of well feared.
