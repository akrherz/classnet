WOW!  Excellent question.  The short answer is "Yes".  In addition to having smaller surface area per leaf, conifers also typically have a very thick waxy cuticle to help minnimize water loss.  You might also be interested to learn that some conifers (e.g., tamarack, larch) are deciduous - and they have much thinner cuticles on their needles.
