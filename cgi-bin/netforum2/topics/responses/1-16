I'm not sure that the two-kingdom model "went into effect" at any particular point in time.  It is the bias we all grow up with - plants and animals are easily observed in the macroscopic, terrestrial world.  The two-kingdom system does have a long history - it  was used by Linnaeus (instituted binomial nomenaclature) in the 1700s.
