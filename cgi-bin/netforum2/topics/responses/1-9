Essentially we already have this problem - the species we already know about don't fit "neatly" into the 5-Kingdom model.  New species are being discovered constantly - some of these may not fit well either (consider the Archeabacteria).  With regard to the evolution of new species, and especially groups of species distinct enough to be considered a new kingdom....... that would be a very long process (millions of years), we may be quite lucky indeed if there are still human taxonomists around to worry about such matters. :)
