Not completely sure that I understand your question - heterospory and seed production are not always correlated - e.g., Selaginella is heterosporous, but does not produce seeds, Pine trees are heterosporous and do produce seeds.  The point, I guess, is to understand what heterospory is, so that you will be able to understand seeds/seed production as we discuss that topic.  <br>

"wood" is secondary xylem - I'm not sure if tree ferns produce secondary xylem, at least in the same way that conifers and dicots do..... I'll try to find out....
