First, remember that in some types of plants (all vascular plants) the sporophyte is the dominant generation, while in other types of plants (non-vascular plants) the gametophyte generation is dominant.  So, we have examples of both situations.  In terms of advantages, think from a genetic perspective - if a gametophyte has a recessive gene that is deleterious in some way, it will still be expressed.  In the sporophyte that recessive allele could be masked by a dominant version of the same gene.
