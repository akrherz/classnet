Not to be rude, but I think that your argument has weaknesses.  You have some very vagues statements that are difficult to follow. For instance, what are these "obvious advantages and detractions" of cloning and aging that you speak of?  How will cloning, a process costing over a million dollars per attempt with only a 1 in 50 chance of success, contribute to world overpopulation? 

As for your question about who should decide who gets to live longer and who doesn't:  The only obvious thing is that the rich and a lucky few from the middle-class will live; the poor will die.  Only those who can afford our advancing medical technology will ever benefit from it.  Current medical technology has undoubtedly progressed beyond the first kidney transplant in 1951 (Apello, 1993)and the first liver transplant in 1963. These technologies, while over 40 years old, are still only predominantly used by the rich and prestigious members of the world.  Mickey Mantle recieved his kidney transplant surgery even though his cancer had spread and he was inevitably going to die soon.  Meanwhile common Americans, having waited on the transplant list for month and years, died. Senators such as the one from Pennsylvania catapult to the top of transplant lists while others wait for years. 

Anti-Aging drugs, though potentially inexpensive to produce, will bear an ethical price so great that even the rich will not be able to afford it.
