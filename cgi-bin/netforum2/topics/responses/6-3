Thats a good point on the cosmetic world.  I could too imagine what would happen.  It would be like the breast implants--a phase of looking younger and beautiful till something goes wrong.  With the breast implants, it was the leaking.  With this special chemical, your face turns into cancer cells.  Then we end up paying for the mistakes by money and lives.  I hope though that this discovery will be put into better uses than beauty.

===message:Like Lori, I think you have an interesting point.  Do you think the industry would actually use the chemical though, or just buy the rights to it in order to keep it off the market?  If they put it on the market, it would put a huge dent in the day-to-day sales of cosmetics.  Have you ever heard the tales about how the oil companies buy the patent rights to carburetors that would allow engines to get 100 miles/gallon in order to keep their oil sales up?  Would the cosmetic industry do the same thing?
