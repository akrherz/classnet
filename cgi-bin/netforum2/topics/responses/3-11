===message:It is so true that it is the overpopulation that is the cause of starvation here, but it is also true that lack of food is also the indirect cause of their starvation.Their starvation is due to overpopulation which then causes reduction in food resources. Giving them more food would only worsen the overpopulation problem. In the long run, if this is done(giving them food), they will overshoot their carrying capacity just like what happened on Easter Island.
