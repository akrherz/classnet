===message:<P> I was curious if the article mentioned how Alzheimer's releases free radicals. I’m not very familiar with the disease, and  I was curios as to how it would release the free radicals.

===message:Unfortunately the article didn't say HOW the free radicals were produced.  And although the article does not state this it would be my assumption that the free radicals are the byproducts of the process Alzhiemers (and stroke) goes through when damaging the brain cells.  I would also guess that the result would be the same in any process that damages brain cells, but this might be a question that could be examined through research. If it was true that any type of brain damage produces free radicals perhaps the MnSOD would be of potential benefit in those cases as well.
