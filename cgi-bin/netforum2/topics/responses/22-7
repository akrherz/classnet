===message:Our group believes that with the population that this group has choosen, the bio-diversity will eventually decrease due to a lack of space, over-population, an excess of waste products, and many other factors.  The population will not have the technology, because they have a lower standard of living, and therefore would not know how to preserve the environment, by using modern methods such as recycling.
