===message:Right now, the earth is supporting six billion people. By reducing the population to three billion people it seems illogical to assume that the Earth will not be able to support that life, as you have stated. Having an improvement of technology will not decrease the amount of human life. Improved health resources will actually extend the life expectancy which will decrease the death rate. As the death rate decreases, population will increase. Also, once it's gone, it's gone. You can't 'replenish' resources, or biodiversity.
