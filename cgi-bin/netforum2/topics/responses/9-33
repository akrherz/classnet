===message:Although I dismissed it in my recommendation, education is on of the best tools that we have against any problem that our world may face.  I also feel that raising awareness can be done through some sort of advertising campaign.  If we advertised what global warming was as much as you see a Nike commercial on TV everyone would know what global warming was.  Another reason I agree education is important is because by educating and more people knowing about global warming, there are more people to brainstorm on how to stop it from happening.
