===message:When you have an animal do tricks, like at Sea World, I do not think it is immoral.  If you have a dog, don't you train it to do tricks.  It is good to train an animal to do tricks, it stimulates their minds.  If they do not have these tricks to do they get bored.  They also get bored with the tricks they know well, and like to learn more.  It is actuall good for them to learn all these tricks.  While it does not appear to be very nice to make a caged animal to do tricks on command, it is actually nothing they would not do in their normal environment.  So in actuallity, by having them jump out of the water, you are actually helping them cope with their environment and making it seem a little more like home.
