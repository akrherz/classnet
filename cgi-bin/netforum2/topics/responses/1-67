An example of the type of pine tree you are talking about would be "jack pine" (Pinus banksiana,  I believe).  The cones stay sealed until exposed to fire - providing a seed bank that is available immediately after the fire.  Yes, many types of plants are adapted to fire.  For example, the prairie grasses and forbs that made up the pre-european settlement Iowa landscape were highly adapted to fire.  Their strategy was to have the critical part of the plant (e.g., the shoot apical meristem) below ground.
