===message:I agree about the necessity of trees to keep levels of greenhouse gases safe.  I happen believe that deforestation in this country isn't the big problem.  The rate of deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and others dotting the earth, however, is mind boggling.  While the U.S. has decimated some forests in this country, it has planted a lot of trees where there weren't any before.  Hacking down huge tracts of rainforests in Brazil, for instance, is a far more serious problem.  Vast acres of trees are being reduced to charred dirt everyday.<P>
Technically, the U.S. can do very little to stop deforestation in foreign countries.  It would not be very diplomatic of us to charge in and demand that those countries stop cutting down trees.  This would be especially hypocritical because U.S. industries are the ones producing most of the gases that have put the earth into this mess in the first place.  The only thing that I can think of to save what's left of the monstrous rainforests, is to make the preservation of them profitable.  God only knows how to do that though...
