	Hmmmmmmm..... very interesting question - and not easy to answer either.  Part of the problem, of course, is that we don't know about the complete range of organisms in any of these Kingdoms (especially Monerans).  You also ask about several features - lifestyle, structures, functions.  With regard to lifestyles I'd probably go with Monerans or Protists.  With regard to structures/functions I'd probably go with Animals.  But plants and fungi do some pretty amazing things too.
