You have an interesting point about keeping "great minds" or perhaps other "worthwhile" people alive. But who would decide which persons are worthy of extended life and which ones are not?

===message:It would be nice to keep around many of the great minds of the past.  But who would decide who those great minds are??? There are so many in our past that have done so many wonderful and amazing things.  What if every great mind of our past were alive today.  Think of the possibilities!! But what about the problems.  There would inevitably be chaos.  Age brings stubbornness, and with stubbornness comes anger.  A bunch of angry people would not be my kind of fun.  And what about the great minds invloved in the wars of the past.  If every one of those minds were alive today, we would end up destroying ourselves because age does not necessarily bring with it intelligence.
