I'm not entirely sure that I understand your question.  Extrinsic barriers refer to physical barriers to gene flow (e.g., mountains/oceans) that result in the formation of species.  Extrinsic barriers resulting from Continental drift would be more likely to result in dinosaur species diversification rather than extinction.
