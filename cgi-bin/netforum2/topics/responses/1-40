We are exposed to many kinds of fungal spores in our everyday life.  Those that are able (because of their genetic information) to establish an infection in, or on, our bodies are the ones that are "harmful".  The effects vary from annoying (e.g., athlete's foot) to life threatening (e.g., fungal lung infections).  Fungal infections can be much more difficult to treat than bacterial infections because their metabolism is much closer to ours.  Chemicals that inhibit fungal growth are often toxic to our cells as well.
