===message:I agree with you Aaron.  I think that would could give some to other countries but they should at least exchange somthing for what we give them.  If they have a resource or something that is worth value in therre country we should tell them that we would like to trade our corn for the valued item.  If we did not do this then it would hurt the farmers and it would hurt the tax payers also.
