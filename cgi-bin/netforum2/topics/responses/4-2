This is a very interesting and informative report. However, the assignment instructions ask you to include the primary structure of your protein in your report. You may still receive credit for this by submitting the primary structure information as an addendum to this report. Simply submit the information as a reply to your original message reporting your assignment.<P>

===message:The primary structure of the alpha helix of hemoglobin is as follows:  val, leu, ser, pro, ala, asp, lys, thr, asn, val, lys, ala, ala, trp, gly, lys, val, gly, ala, his, ala, gly, glu, tyr, gly, ala, glu, ala, leu, glu, arg, met, phe, leu, ser, phe, pro, thr, thr, lys, thr, tyr, phe, pro, his, phe, asp, leu, ser, his, gly, ser, ala, gln, val, lys, gly, his, gly, lys, lys, val, ala, asp, ala, leu, thr, asn, ala, val, ala, his, val, asp, asp, met, pro, asn, ala, leu, ser, ala, leu, ser, asp, leu, his, ala, his, lys, leu, arg, val, asp, pro, val, asp, phe, lys, leu, leu, ser, his, cys, leu, leu, val, thr, leu, ala, ala, his, leu, pro, ala, glu, phe, thr, pro, ala, val, his, ala, ser, leu, asp, lys, phe, leu, ala, ser, val, ser, thr, val, leu, thr, ser, lys, tyr, arg.  The alpha helix contains 141 amino acids. <P>
The primary structure of the beta sheet of hemoglobin is val, his, leu, thr, pro, glu, glu, lys, ser, ala, val, thr, ala, leu, trp, gly, lys, val, asn, val, asp, glu, val, gly, gly, glu, ala, leu, gly, arg, leu, leu, val, val, tyr, pro, trp, thr, gln, arg, phe, phe, glu, ser, phe, gly, asp, leu, ser, thr, pro, asp, ala, val, met, gly, asn, pro, lys, val, lys, ala, his, gly, lys, lys, val, leu, gly, ala, phe, ser, asp, gly, leu, ala, his, leu, asp, asn, leu, lys, gly, thr, phe, ala, thr, leu, ser, glu, leu, his, cys, asp, lys, leu, his, val, asp, pro, glu, asn, phe, arg, leu, leu, gly, asn, val, leu, val, cys, val, leu, ala, his, his, phe, gly, lys, glu, phe, thr, pro, pro, val, gln, ala, ala, tyr, gln, lys, val, val, ala, gly, val, ala, asn, ala, leu, ala, his, lys, tyr, his.  The beta sheet contains 146 amino acids.  <P>
	Both the alpha helix and the beta sheet are represented twice in the tertiary protein structure for a total of four polypeptide chains. (G. Fermi, 1998) <P>
