===message:I was wondering whether any of the 183 people studied were twins.  I know that twins are very similar when it comes to genetic makeup, and since this study focused on the relationship of a specific section of the sixth chromosome and the degree of schizophrenia, it made me curious as to how close the results of such a study would be.
