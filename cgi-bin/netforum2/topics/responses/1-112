Very difficult question to answer......  My guess is that angiosperms will remain the dominant form of vegetation on our planet until there is some major change in the climate/conditions here on earth (caused by humans????).  There are examples of evolution leading to less complex organisms - for example duckweeds are quite small simple plants - but they are flowering plants.
