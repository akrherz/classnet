Molds are members of the Kingdom Fungi.  They typically reproduce asexually.  Without any sexual reproductive stages it's impossible to assign them one of the three Divisions of Kingdom Fungi (Zygomycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota), and they are placed in the "Deuteromycota".  Those molds that, on rare occasions, do reproduce sexually, can be assigned to one the three Divisions.
