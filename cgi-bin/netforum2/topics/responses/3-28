===message:Teaching agricultural techniques or starting them out in crop production might be more efficient in the long-run than simply  giving away surplus grain.  Although some land might be more fertile than others, this idea might allow a country who was too dependent on outside help in the past to now begin to become self-reliant.  The thought of everyone turning into vegetarians is unrealistic right now.  One unit of grain could feed 10 people if eaten directly, but only one person if fed to livestock.  For this reason more people could be fed by grain alone.
