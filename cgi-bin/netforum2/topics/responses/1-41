Interesting question.  It will undoubtedly be very difficult to name all the organisms on Earth.  Those that go extinct before they're named, we'll simply never know about (and we won't know about any interesting or valuable properties they might have had).  The important thing to realize is that, right now (due to human activity) species are going extinct at a much greater rate than new species are evolving.  That's why it is so critical to try to learn all we can about the species that are here now.
