===message:<P>I was curious about whether you ran across anything about a ‘PNA’ (Pre-nucletide acid). I’m not sure if such a thing has been suggested. It seems to me though that of the earth’s temperature was as hot as now thought, that RNA would never have time to develop. I was thinking that a PNA would have A,U,G, and maybe a substitute for C. Along with that thought I think a different backbone might be in order too. I was just curious if you ran across anything of the such.

===message:Out of curiosity I was wondering what your own opinion on RNA and the early atmospheric conditions of earth.  Personally, I don't see why scientists are so stuck on the earth's early atmosphere having to be an extreme in one way or another.  Until we know better I think we should be open to any and every possibilty.

I've never heard anything about PNA before, so I searched through the net to see if I could find something about it.  Unfortunately I didn't find much.  I'm curious myself about PNA since you've asked me.  So, I don't have much opinion except that your theory sounds logical.<P>

Here are a few web sites that I found with some info on PNA.<P>

I really don't know what to think about RNA now that Jonathan had asked about PNA as a precursor to RNA.  But, I think that Earth could have either been cold or hot, its just that life evolved when the temperatures was perfect. If RNA (or PNA??) can't servive hot temps, then obviously life evolved in cooler temps.  I agree with you with the arguement--we will never know what Earth was like then.
