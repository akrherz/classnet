===message:hi all,
I'm Wes.  I'm a freshman working on degrees in biochem and engineering science.  So, I guess you could say that I'm busy.  I like to rock climb, snowboard, bike, hike, and sleep.  If anyone would like to do the study-group thing, let me know.  I'm most definitely game.  Anyways, hi and good luck.
later.
