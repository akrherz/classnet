===message:Like Matt said, why is it considered wrong to "cheat death"?  Does that mean we shouldn't cheat death with penecillin? or measles vaccines? or develop new medical treatments of any kind?  Besides, this isn't really an anti-aging chemical.  Its a naturally occuring substance that is found in young human cells.  But I still think the most important applications of this knowledge will be in dealing with AIDS and cancer.

===message:I believe the anti-aging idea goes against a natural life.  
I do think that medicine should be used to help people, but
postponing death with a drug seems rediculous to me.  Those who are sick deserve to have treatment to make them well, but there is a time when your life is supposed to end.  Like many have said, population would explode, and who would have access to this type of product?  That's scary.  Life is to make the best of all you can before you die, because we don't know when that will be.  Controlling existance to that extreme goes against my way of looking at and living my life.

===message:What would be the use of living forever?? There is only so much that one can accomplish in one's lifetime before the body naturally starts to break down.  And even if the body were to have the ability to regenerate and make itself better, what would be the use?? We are meant to die and let the future peoples take over and make their own memories and discoveries.  By cheating people out of their own lives we are cheating ourselves.  A life that lasts over a century just does not seem very fulfilling.

===message:I don't think the issue is just living longer.  To me, the issue is "how are we living?"  We already know that the earth could support many, many more humans than it is supporting now.  The issue is, can we as humans live without destroying the rest of creation.  We could, but we're not.  And I don't know but what it may take the destruction of most of the human race as we know it to stop the destruction of the rest of creation, but again, I really don't know.

===message:It really depends on whether you are the one living it doesn't it?  I know many 16 year-olds, 40-year olds (well, maybe not many of them but a few), even 50 & 60 year olds who do not appear to be living a fulfilling life.  Is it time to say, "Sorry, your life's not fulfilling so time's up!"?

===message:I hear all these people who wish for a factual debate about this anti-aging stuff. I am just the man to give it to you. Look at China for a second.  An overpopulated nation that must limit the amount of children one fam,ily can.  Now you're asking why, and the response is that because they don't have enough food.  There is only so much land to go around, so why should we give people an anti-agung drug that will add to an alreday overpopulated world.  Ohers of you argue that we should keep the great people alive, but how do you determine the worth of one person over another?  You think oof a way that all people can recieve this drug without overpopulating this bation, then I say go ahead and anti-ager yourself.  The only problem is with more poepl we lose space, and that space goes to the production of food, so I say why mess with our ecosystem? Pardon the saying that has been around for centuries, but if ain't broke don't fix it.

===message:Damon, Hi.  I get what you're saying and insofar as it goes, I agree.  But, I don't think overpopulation is really the issue with this chemical.  It is Not a drug for anti-aging, but a discovery of a natural substance that occurs in young cells.  It is an area of Research that may allow us to understand how cancer and AIDS function, and perhaps allow us to find a way to battle them.  In both cancer and AIDS the devastation spreads because the cells are reacting abnormally--kind of like they did when the cells were young, kind of like this chemical Might make them act.  So if we understand this chemical and its function better, maybe we can cure cancer and AIDS.  So, from where I stand, this is Not an anti-aging drug, or fountain of youth; its hope for the future for the millions upon million who suffer from these diseases, either directly or indirectly.
