We won't adress this topic in 201 - but, you'll hear alot about xylem and phloem in 202.  Briefly, xylem and phloem are the two types of tissues that compose the "vascular tissues" of vascular plants.  Xylem is involved in the transport of water and mineral nutrients.  Phloem is involved in the transport of sugars produced by photosynthesis.
