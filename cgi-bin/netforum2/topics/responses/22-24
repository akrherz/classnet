===message:The main problem with scenario three is that if you look at the "less developed" countries of today you find that they are having trouble keeping their populations constant.  Poorer standards of health care, frequent social disruptions, and rampant diseases in the less developed countries cause significant decreases in the population. In addition to that, lack of advancement within the less developed countries would cause a further decrease in education because a problem would come along, such as a contagious, deadly disease, and the population would not be well enough educated to come up with a long term cure for the disease, therefore wiping out a majority if not eventually all of the human population.  Therefore the human population would not advance, but instead move backwards, to more and more caveman-like creatures, where their main concerns would be food and reproduction (and not the intellectual advancement of their species or the decreasing amounts of biodiversity within the global ecosystem), eventually dying out. (However biodiversity would probably increase because we wouldn't be around!)

===message:Nick Boyd, Jennifer Johnson, Rick Monserud, Janessa A. Morgan, Laura Nosbisch--First of all, by allowing countries to be "less developed", they may be using fewer number of resources, but they will also be wasting the resources they are using because they will not be advanced enough to utilize these resources properly.  Populations will not survive longer in "less developed" countries because life expenctancies are shorter due to lack of knowledge and utilized resources.  Also, in these countries, you find higher birth and death rates due to the same lack of knowledge and resources, as well as problems such as deadly diseases/viruses.  This may significantly alter the population to a dramatically low level.  How would you convince "developed" countries to revert to the "less-developed" ways, anyway?  Also, with 85% biodiversity remaining, although plant/animal extinctions may decrease to some extent, the available resoures would essentially go to waste with no humans looking toward the future and making advances such as those you would find in "developed" countries.
