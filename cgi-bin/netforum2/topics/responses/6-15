===message:   I agree with your thoughts fully.  In today's society, there are so many forms of "natural" population control.  Car accidents, suicide, pre-mature deaths, natural deaths, etc. They are all part of nature.    In nature, as most people think of it, death occurs every day, in many shapes and forms.  Animals die and decompose but new life eventually springs forth.  In our world, the same thing happens, in a sense.  People die and people are born.  Some diseases kill many and some diseases are stopped before they ever become a threat.  I believe this is all a natural part of life and it should continue this way.  By messing with anti-aging techniques, we are messing with something beyond our power. Nature is simply somthing we should not mess with.
