===message:Scenario two would leave us in a poor biological situation.  As E.O. Wilson said, "Biological diversity is the key to the maintenance of the world as we know it."  Leaving a population of ten billion people with only ten percent of biodiversity is wreckless.  With a drop in biodiversity of 90 percent in such a small amount of time as a hundred years would cause a catastrophy to so many biomes at one time that the entire biosphere would be threatened.  Today we have a little more than half of this population and people are still starving to death.  Damage to the entire biosphere would threaten the human race with extinction.  The lack in diversity in small gene pools would make the existing life extremely vulnerable to changes in environment or diseases.  High density in one population  would increase the spread of disease.  Also shown in todays behaviors of the human race, high density causes an increase of social problems such as crime and war, due to the competion for resources.

===message:With 10% of  the biodiversity left on earth none of the 10 billion people would be able to take their children to the zoo to see exotic  species  bacause they wouldn't be on earth any longer.  No matter the technology there has not been a way to bring back a dead species.   Cultures on earth would crumble without their specific sacrifices and dedications to animals.  Keeping 10 billion people up to current day standards would be a hard task, besides being costly.  People on Earth are starving and suffering now so why not double the population.  By doubling the population you are also doubling the risk of disease and elevating crime rates.  Overall, increasing the population and decreasing the amount of biodiversity would lead to a sad and dying world not a world of joy.

===message:We disagree with this group's interpretation of scenario 2.  It is important to consider the survival of all species on Earth and not just the human population. Ten billion people would quickly consume all available resources, particularly if their standard of living is similar to that of developed nations today.  (The Earth currently has 6 billion people.) Diversity is the key to survival of the ecosystem as a whole.  With only 10% of the biodiversity on Earth today the ecosystem is very fragile.  It is more susceptible to loss of species. The human population will in turn feel the effect since all species in an ecosystem are connected in a web of life.

===message:Becky Stodola, Lynnette Turner, Nick McKenna, and Victor Van Laar :

Hmmm...let us just say a couple of things regarding your little "scenario".
First of all, we need to say that we DO agree with your choice of having a well developed world.  As for everything else, we have a couple of problems.
1)  Lets just say that in this time and age, we are already struggling with poverty, overpopluation, and unequal distribution of resources.
2)  In addition how are we going to sustain the rate of the use of the biodiversity in the future, if we are already starting to use it up when we currently have only 6 billion people compaired to the 10 billion that you intend to have.
3)  How will only 10% of the current biodiverstiy be able to sustain a world of that many people? 

:-P

===message:We believe that having such a high amount of people would be 
bad for the environment.  With six billion in the world 
right now, how could 10 billion ever manage.  With the 
diversity also cut way down, the ecosystems would be 
destroyed and would not support such a large quantity of 
people.  The biodiversity might now also come back with such 
a low number of species left.  To the point that there needs 
to be a lot of interaction between humans; there can be an 
interaction between two people and not necessarily 10 
billion.  It is just too many people on one small planet.  
We believe that the planet would die and humans, as you 
believe, would be the downfall to this.  The only 
substitution would be having all synthetic goods and foods 
and I would hate to have dehydrated ice cream al

===message:We feel that due to the large number of responses we have received to our proposal, that we should clarify some of the points that were made. One interesting observation made by several of the groups in the class was that since we're already dealing with a problem of starvation, that the Earth would not be able to sustain ten billion people on only ten percent biodiversity. It's not the diversity that will sustain humans, it's which species comprise that ten percent that's important. This ten percent include "all the species tat are currently used for food, fuel, fiber, or pharmaceuticals." Therefore, we would be able to have the same things that we have now. The ninety percent that will be lost are things that humans do not use, some of which we've never heard of before. We wouldn't miss anything because we never had it to begin with. Right now, we do have the resources to sustain the whole Earth, but there have even been times in our country's history in which the government has paid farmers not to produce. This diversity does not lead to the conclusion that the gene pools will be small as well. Within each species, diversity will be as preserved as it is now. Not being able to bring back dead species is something that we'll never be able to do and for those who have said that they will try to regain their diversity, it is an impossibility. Evolution of a new species does not happen over night. Our greater technology will  be able to help us in many ways. We won't destroy ecosystems, because we will have artificial biospheres to preserve what is necessary for our survival. This will also help to sustain that ten percent so we won't lose it all. Another way this will help is in the area of agriculture. Having a greater knowledge of land and farming we will be able to use less land, thus leaving some land previously used for farming to humans for homes which will decrease the density. We will also have our biospheres to make previously uninhabitable places available for our use. Our world WILL be a World o' Joy.
