===message:It sure sounds reasonable for everybody to do the little things. To help stop global warming this is not feasible the problem lies more within industrial processes and deforestation than recycling and walking to work. I do agree that the little things could accumulate into alot of good especially if we all did our part. But the effects of large scale devastation is very hard to comprehend, we would do more as a society if we would try to help the developing nations develop their economies so they are not so hard on the environment. More regulations on industry world-wide is also needed.
