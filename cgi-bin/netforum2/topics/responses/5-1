===message:Over the summer I read a book entitled "Darwin
's Black Box" by Michael Behe.  It concerns the fact that 
scientists currently cannot explain the gradual evolution of 
such systems as blood clotting and cellular transportation 
because of their irreducible complexity at a biochemical 
level.  His conclusion is that life on the molecular level 
could not have evolved and that therefore some living 
systems must have had a designer, although there is no way 
to tell who or what this designer is.  Behe doesn't 
condradict evolution on the macroscopic level however, he 
just says the theory of Darwinian evolution has run into  a 
dead end concerning the inner workings of the cell.  I would 
like anyones opinion who has read this book.  I found it 
very convincing scientifically, but I'm not a molecular 
biologist so how would I know if he's got a sound argument.

===message:Sure, Creationalism exists and so does Evolution.  In the beginning, there would have to be something to start with.  How does that something get there though?  It boils down to the question of the beginning of matter.
It makes sense that there was someone (God) or something to start it all.
After this happened, doesn't it make sense that God would have left the creatures to evolve and to actually 'create' man, and that God only added the power of knowledge?

===message:I can't explain how it all began, but I do know that evolution makes sense to me.  I am not religous in the conventional sense, I have my own relationship with life. I don't understand how someone can cling to an idea so strongly that they are unwilling to explore other options.  From what I know of Creationism, and evolution the two can be reconsiled.  I think that the bible is taken to litteraly, it was ment to be a general guide line not a rule.  Creation says that the world was created in seven days, but who are we to say what a day is to a god.  I am not saying that all of you who believe in creation are wrong, and evolution is right, just that you should try to look at life from another perspective.

===message:   I don't believe Dr. Boury should have to worry about offending any one.  Her job is to teach us biology.  If you don't like the material, don't take the class.  I, myself, believe in evolution.  Some may argue that there isnt enough proof to suport evolution.  In my eyes there is plenty of proof, and the process is so complex that it will be a very long time before all the facts are known.  I havn't seen enough proof in my life to support creation, so I have been slowly moving away from my religion.  If Christianity is the "true" religion, why don't all the people in the world follow it.  No one can tell me that all Native Americans, Hindus, Bhudist, etc. are going to hell.

===message:First of all, I don't want to sound picky, but when you are talking about the Bible, you need to capitalize it.  It is the title of a book and deserves that respect.  If you haven't guessed, I am a strong believer in Creation.  I believe that what the Bible says is true.  Yes, maybe there isn't proof that you can see, but some things you have to take in faith.  You can't believe everything that you see.  Just because someone comes up with a logical explanation for something doesn't mean it's right.  Also, we know that God didn't just start it all off, but that he created all living things because it says so right in the Bible.  It even, if you read closely, talks about dinosaurs in the Bible.  
	I also don't see anything wrong with teaching Evolution.  But you shouldn't press it on people and say this is what you have to believe.  But it is always good to see the story from both sides.  
	I have more to say, but can't put it into to words at the moment.  I welcome any responses and thoughts about my comments.

===message:I believe than Creationism and Evolutionism are different words describing the same thing.  Just as doctors use medical terms when talking to other doctors and laymen terms when talking to patients.  Scientists use Evolutionism while Religous people use Creationism.  I feel I can say this because Our concept of a day and God's concept of a day differ.  For God a day can mean several thousand/million years in our time definition.  In the Bible it say that God made Adam from the earth.  Scientists have slready begun to prove that this is possible by making ammino acids out of ammonia, methane and water (substances believed to be in abundance during the early stages of earth).  From ammino acids scientists have been able to make peptides and then protobionts.  These are part of livng organisms basic structures.  Just because scientist have not yet been able to produce real living organisms doesn't make it impossible.  There are many ideas and concepts that started out without physical proof.  The technology to produce real living organisms may not be invented yet.  That is not to say that it won't eventually happen.
