===message:I agree with Andria in that there is no one step to solving the current problem with global warming.  Many little steps must be made.  I also agree with her on the point she made about cars being the major culprit.   Reducing the allowed emission of greenhouse gases from cars would be a major step in the battle against global warming.  This brings up the major problem with all plans dealing with this subject, execution.   Who is going to be responsible for carrying out these plans?  The financial side is the biggest question mark in my mind.

===message:I think that your recomendation is a fine idea.  Another way to go about lessening the amount of CO2 is to create cars that run cleaner.  They've been working on cars that run on different types of fuels for several years now.  One such automobile is the electric car.  Another runs on pure alcohol.  Although expensive, it runs extremely clean and produces little CO2.

===message:I totally agree with your recomendation.  Especially the part on finding a more efficient energy source.  When we decide to actually make a change and stop talking about change we will be helping our situation.    In "we" I am refering to our world leaders AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS.
