Very perceptive question.  Essentially, what you're saying is that are costs, or difficulties, associated with being a terrestrial photosynthetic organism.  But, you also need to think about the benefits of being such an organism - particularly the benefits available some 470 million years ago........ the benefit?  NO competition, no herbivores, etc... that was the advantage to adapting to life on land.
