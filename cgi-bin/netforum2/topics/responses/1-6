Perfection in taxonomy, as in any endeavor, is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.  However, it is clear that we CAN get a more complete picture of the diversity of life on Earth - if we put forward the effort.  I'm sure that a taxonomist (I'm not one) would also give "curiosity" as a reason.  A simple reason, perhaps, but one that has driven many, if not all, major discoveries.  <br>

<br>

What next?  Well, who knows.  Some of these organisms may be very important to understanding the evolution of life on earth.  Others may be useful to that species so "near and dear" to our hearts...... "Homo sapiens".  If the mold Penicillium had never been described by taxonomists, we would have been deprived of a very useful antibiotic.
