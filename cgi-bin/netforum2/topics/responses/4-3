===message:I have both sides to argue. I do agree that this country was built on freedom of choice but we as Americans need to help out as much as possible. We eat the most meat in the world and I feel that we should limit what we eat. Know how do you do that? I have no ideas right know but can come up with some with some research. Beleive me, I don't want to abecome a vegetarian but if it will saves some lives I will if I have to. The comment about the people not existing is a bit harsh. Just because you don't know someone doesn't mean you can't help them out. Look at all the homeless shelters out there people are brought in but no one knows them until tehy get in there. I can see it both ways and being a American I feel it is the deed to help out as much as possible.
