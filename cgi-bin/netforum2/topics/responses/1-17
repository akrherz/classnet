       Yes, indeed. For example, the ancient Greeks used taxonomic classifications. Some
       knowledge of taxonomy was essential for all native cultures (this plant is good to eat,
       this one will kill you......) Systems based on the Greeks were used up until the 1700s
       when Linneaus popularized the use of binomial nomenclature. (Darwin, remember, lived
       during the 1800s). All of these earlier approaches suffered from insufficient information
       - the species they knew about were relatively limited in number and location. Of course,
       we haven't solved that problem even today........
