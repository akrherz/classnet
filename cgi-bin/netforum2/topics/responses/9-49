===message:I recommend consuming energy or using it more efficeintly.  There are "little" ways of doing this, cutting annual emissions of carbon dioxide by thousands of pounds a year.  Make sure that airleaks around doors and windows are plugged with caulk and weatherstrip.  This may save up to 1000 lbs. a year for just one home.  Image if every household did this, how much energy would be saved.
