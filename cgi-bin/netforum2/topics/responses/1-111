The outermost layer of a seed is the seed coat - that would be the shiny, hard brown layer around an apple seed.  The fleshy portion of the apple (what you eat) is the "fruit".  The purpose of the fruit is to get the seeds dispersed by an animal that eats the fruit.  Red fruits are often more attractive to animals than green fruits.  That last question means you're working on a Mac :)
