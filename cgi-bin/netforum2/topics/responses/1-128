The production of agricultural hybrids is completely dependent upon human activities - this is called "artificial selection".  But, if humans stopped "fooling around" with plant genes, "natural selection" would continue.  E.g., the corn that was selected for wouldn't be likely to be corn that is adapated to high fertilizer application, and capable of extremely high grain yields........
