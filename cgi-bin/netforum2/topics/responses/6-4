===message:I agree with Dallas.  The benefits of these chemicals would not be the "fountain of youth" aspects, but the use of the chemicals to potentially end the deadly diseases that are considered some of the world's biggest problems.  This brings up an interesting question.  Why are we considering it ethically wrong to use this chemical for eternal youth, when research done to attempt to cure certain diseases is aimed at extending life as long as possible?
