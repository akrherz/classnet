===message:With what draconian program would you reduce the population by nearly half?  Would life be worth living in a world where our fertility, the most private aspect of our lives, is contolled so rigidly?  Wouldn't 3 billion people at a developed country's standard of living pollute the planet and consume its resources to the point of eroding whatever biodiversity you mananged to maintain?
