===message:Hi! This is my first semester as a junior and my second one at Iowa State.  I am a Biology/pre-med major.  I plan to attend PA school when I finish at Iowa State.  I would really like to attend the University of Iowa for that, but we'll have to wait and see what happens.  

I am married and have two great boys, Josh is 4 and Reid is 7 months.  They keep me very busy.  In fact, since Reid was born, I have been taking just two courses at a time because that's about all I can handle if I'm going to keep my children happy and my grades up.  

My husband and I enjoy biking, especially Mountain Biking which we did a lot of while living in Rapid City, SD.  However, there are't many mountains around Panora.  I also enjoy walking, swimming, reading (John Irving books are my favorite), sewing, and, most of all, spending time with Josh and Reid.
