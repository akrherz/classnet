I'm not sure how to respond to "How can this be......." - it simply is.  Bristle cone pines are known be quite long-lived - much longer than many other tree species.  By the way, the age of the trees is determined by making a core through the trunk (non-lethal!) and counting the "growth rings" - yearly increments of secondary xylem.
