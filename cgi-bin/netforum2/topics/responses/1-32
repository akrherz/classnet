Hmmmmm - a rather pessimistic viewpoint.......  Let me try to get you to think about some additional perspectives.  First of all, while more species may indeed be going extinct each day (currently due in large part to human activity), it's not likely that new species are evolving every day - mutations, new gene combinations etc. require long periods of time to lead to new species.  So, in essence, we are currently destroying species faster than they are being produced.  This means that the "biodiversity" of our planet is declining.  Whether you think that's a problem is, in part, a matter of personal preference - but don't forget that we humans depend on the natural world for many "services" (e.g., production of oxygen, food, medicines, decay of dead organic matter, etc.).  In addition, decreasing the rate at which planet earth loses species may require that we actually know WHAT we're trying to save - a species whose existance we're unaware might go extinct without any effort on our part to save it - a tragedy from a "biodiversity" perspective........ and, of course, potentially a personal tragedy if that organism happened to produce some substance that could have been used to treat some human disease......
