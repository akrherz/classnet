   I was trying to think of something to write for my "profile" and I came across yours.  I happen to be a senior in Nutrition Science too and I was glad to see that someone else is besides me (in this freshman level course). In fact, you are one of very few people I "know" that is a Nutrition Science major. I am currently looking at Grad Schools, so I wish you luck in Pharmacy school!

                                    Take care,
                                    Roxanne
