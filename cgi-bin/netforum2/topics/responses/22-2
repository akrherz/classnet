===message:We strongly disagree with your beliefs about the fourth scenario.  First of all, a population of three billion is much more susceptible to being wiped out by a plague or any other natural disaster.  Also, it has been said that technology is a main cause of resource depletion.  Well developed countries with a highly advanced level of technology would require more resource usage, resulting in  a severe decline of the available natural resources.  In conclusion, your scenario may provide a better standard of living, but it can also create the potential for an inbalance of the ecosystem.
