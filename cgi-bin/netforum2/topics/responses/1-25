Hmmmmmm.... under the conditions you describe the bacterial cell would likely survive - at least in the short term.  It is in fact possible to do what you suggest with both bacterial and plant cells.  Removal of cell walls is typically enzymatic.  The results are called "protoplasts" for plant cells and "spheroplasts" (I believe) for bacterial cells.  These are typically not able to survive indefinitely unless they reform a cell wall.
