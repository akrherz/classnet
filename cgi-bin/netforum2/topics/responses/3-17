===message:I think asking people to stop eating meat is an unrealistic solution to a global problem.  What people eat is a totally personal choice.  Although eating less red meat has been proven to be a healthier way of life, this would have to be a personal choice.  By offering information about world hunger and what we can do to help simply be eating less meat along with other health conscious ideas, people could then make an educated choice.  I think many people are simply unaware of the impact they could make.
