===message:In theory scenario 4 sounds like a feasible situation, however, you fail to take into account the fact that more developed nations over-consume their natural resources at an astronomical rate.  Case in point, the USA with its 275,000,000 people consumes nearly 80% of what is consumed by the whole world.  This means that the US, considered the most developed country in the world, uses 80% of the consumed product for only 5% of the worlds population.  Now, if the whole 3 bilion people in your scenario lived at this standard of living how long would the resourse available last?  NOT LONG!  Not to mention, how unethical is it to kill off 3 billion people??
