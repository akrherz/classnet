===message:     First a correction must be made.  10 million people and 10 billion people are a drastically different amount.  Assuming that 10 billion was meant, one can not help but argue the point that was made in reference to the lower option of population numbers, 3 billion or half of what exists now.  It is a known fact that higher populations increase the total populations risks of extinction by plague, disease, and yes by natural disaster too.  First plagues move faster in more concentrated populations.  So, yes, 10 billion people will survive better than 30 billion with that line of thinking but will not survive better than 3 billion.  Secondly disease acts in a similar fashion to plagues.  Thus, the same is true in both cases.  Thirdly natural disasters can in fact be more damaging to larger populations depending on the living situations of the populations.  If for example the people live in large apartments, which are needed for such large populations because of the lack of land, any disaster such as a tornado, earthquake, or fire would in fact wipe out more people due to the crowded environment.  Finally the human race has survived many devastations to its numbers and would probably not survive if a population of 3 billion could not survive.
     In terms of resources and biodiversity, this scenario is both good and bad.  Less developed countries are known to be more, not less destructive, to resources.  They are also known to deplete the resources faster than more developed countries, and with a population of 10 billion, the rate of depletion would be enormous.  Having 85% diversity is great but would not last very long under these circumstances.

===message:Scenario 3 would not be a good choice to implement.  While it is good that 85% of current day biodiversity remains, it is a problem that you have 10 billion humans living at a standard of living that is equivalent to current day "less-developed" countries.  This circumstance in itself is going to encourage disease and cause a very gruesome and painful population crash.  This scenario just maintains our current problems, and the lack of technological advances is going to deplete the natural resources, not increase them.  As was mentioned in The Diversity of Life, it is our current technology today that is allowing us to curb our usage of natural resources.  To destroy this technology would ultimately destroy what resources we have left.

===message:First of all, the Earth wouldn't be able to sustain 10 million lives without the technology of a developed contry.  Secondly, less developed contry is hard to define, and we think that less develped contries with that large of a population will still deplinish the worlds supply of natural resources.  A simple plague has wiped out large portions before and since the situation in scenario 3 says the contry will be less developed. If so, if a plague did occur they would not be able to defend themselves as effiently as a developed contry, and run the risk of extinction.

===message:First of all, the Earth wouldn't be able to sustain 10 million lives without hurting it's ecosystem.  It needs the technology to defend themselves from common diseases. Secondly, "less developed contry" is hard to define. We think that less develped contries with that large of a population will still deplete the worlds supply of natural resources. A simple plague has wiped out large portions before and since the situation in scenario 3 says the contry will be less developed then they are at risk of becoming extinct. Without the technology to defend themselves from the diseases that come with over population then they will struggle to exist.
