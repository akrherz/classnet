Ask yourself this question first - "can feral and domestic cats interbreed?"  The answer is "yes".  They are still the same species, so much of their behavioral difference is presumably due to their environments.  However, domestic and feral cats are likely to be living under quite different sets of selective pressures.  Given no interbreeding and enough time, they might indeed evolve into distinct species.  Tame them?........I don't know.
