===message:I would also be interested in a study group for tests.  Evenings are probably the best times... after 4 on M/W and after 5 on T/R.  The library sounds good.

===message:My name is Alison Feddersen, and I would be interested in the study group, also.  Evenings are best for me on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays; or afternoons, between 11:00 and 12:30 Monday through Friday (preferable.)  Let me know when something gets started.
