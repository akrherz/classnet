Not sure that I know the whole story here, but at least part of the answer is that mosquitoes can't serve as a host for HIV or (as far as I know) hepatitis.  If you look back at the Plasmodium life cycle, you'll see that in the gut of the mosquito is where the oocyst forms and the sporozoites (that infect another human) are produced.
