Good question - take a look at Fig 26.26 (p.542) to see one proposal.  The Archeozoa would consist of Phylum Diplomonada.  The Protista would include the dinoflagellates, ciliates, zooflagellates (we didn't discuss these) and the euglenoids.  Chromista would include the brown algae, water molds, golden algae (we didn't discuss) and diatoms.  According to this proposal the red and green algae would be moved to Kingdom Plantae.
