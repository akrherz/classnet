===message:I agree that giving away surplus grain to "needy" countries is the right thing to do.  I think some type of barter system would be practical, also.  I see no point to letting children starve just to let our excess grain essentially rot.  There should be support systems, too, though, so the country does not become totally dependant upon us.  Educating a country with agricultural knowledge helps them feed themselves for years to come.

===message:<p>While I think that the barter system looks good initially, it could quite easily lead to problems.  For example, by agreeing to trade with a country in exchange for food, we get to set the price of the food and could easily take advantage of the people's poor circumstances.  Also, by trading something as important to them as food, we would establish ourselves as an influential power.  We could easily abuse this power in an imperialist fashion and influence culture, policy, or even economy negatively.  I use the term "we" loosely because these points could easily be applied to "less friendly" countries such as China, etc.</p>
