===message:Actually having the government buy grain to give away would tend to support the price of grain, not reduce it.  (I'm not proposing that we do this--just making a point.)

===message:Gentlemen,  The government already buys excess grain from farmers.  They also pay them not to plant on all of the farmland that they may use.  I beleive that they have been doing this for many years.  My husband informs me that these practices already effect the price of grain and meat. Possibly to keep the prices from changing so drastically, kind of like that changes in the price of gas(maybe). But thus is a market econmy, you never know what is going to happen.
