===message:Our group was appalled by the lack of concern for the decimation of 90 percent of the current bio-diversity. How can one species have the right to decide the fate of millions of other species. Even if you were to base your decision off of what was benificial to humans, there is no real concise method of doing so. We have barely begun to catolog all of the species that do exist. We are in a unique position that we can forcably adapt and proliferate in almost any environment; however, we do have the choice of limiting our population across the earth in order to allow all the species their share of the planet. We have the intelligence and technology to be able to control the birth rate, and there is no reason why we should not utilize them.

But that is just our two cents worth!  :)
