    Once again you have managed to foolify your staements.  Even the smallest of children can tell you that any decision should be wieghed on a scale of pros and cons.  There are certain drawbacks to cloning an individual as there are obvious advantages.  It is imposible to say wether or not these scenerios are advantagous to us until we take a much closer look.  Please, Mr. Patak, do the world a favor and do not speak ever again.
                             ,Sincerely Chandler Tice
