       Good question. First, let me assure you that the majority of eubacteria are NOT the
       source of "awful diseases and conditions". I wanted to help you understand that some of
       these organisms may have impacts on your everyday life, but please don't think they all
       cause diseases! Some are very helpful (e.g., the nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia). But, and
       more importantly, why WOULD bacteria (e.g., actinomycetes) produce antibiotics? The
       reason is most likely competition among bacteria. If an actinomycete produces an
       substance that kills some other bacterial species with which it competes for
       food/resources, the actinomycete will have a competetive advantage. If it turns out that
       substance happens to kill bacteria that cause infections in humans, we call it an
       "antibiotic". Streptomycin is an antibiotic that you may have heard of that is derived
       from actinomycetes.
