===message:I wish it was possible to set world-wide regulations on industry, but its hard enough to get some nations to stop using child labor and sweat-shop....

Current environment woes stem from 3rd world insenstivity and ignorance of health and saftey measures that currently exist.

I wish we could regulate these other countries in ways that they would abide by, but I feel that is impossible.  Our destruction is inevitable because there is money at stake.
