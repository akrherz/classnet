===message: This group's assertion that underdeveloped countries are more resourceful and frugal seems bizarre since it is people in underdeveloped countries who are currently inflicting the most harm on biodiversity by slashing and burning the rainforests. Furthermore, that many people would quickly tax the resources available and biodiversity would once again spiral. We agree that scenerio four is a good idea, and feel that this group's reasoning behind rejecting it is inaccurate. Scenario four never specified the need to kill 3 billion people, merely that it would be possible to achieve.  While it would be difficult, population control by drastically reducing the birthrate could achieve a population of 3 billion people by 2098.

===message:By selecting scenario 3, this group stated that 
underdeveloped countries are more resourceful and frugal but 
in the future that might not be the same.  More developed 
countries will have developed the technology that could cut 
back on the destruction of biodiversity.  Adding an 
additional 4 billion people to the earth in a less-developed 
status would elimate the needed space for food production, 
increase the spread of disease, and would eventually reach 
the carrying capacity of the Earth.  In reality the 
less-developed countries will most likely be those that do 
not posses the technology to reduce the detremental aspects 
of their society.  These countries will still rely on fossil 
fuels, slash and burn tactics, and out dated means of 
population control.  In order to continue the human race we 
must continue to find new ways to produce the food we need 
while protecting our environment.  We feel this is not 
possible with 10 billion people living in under-developed 
conditions.  That is why we chose scenario 4.

===message:This group chose scenario three for some well-founded 
reasons, yet we wish to offer a different viewpoint to their 
proposal.  First of all, we must realize that with such a 
large poulation concentrated heavily in undeveloped areas 
that diseases and starvation would run rampant through these 
areas, and that the survival of these people at such a large 
population would be highly unlikely.  Secondly, it is highly 
unlikely that people in developed countries will be willing 
to give up their creature comforts to accept a lower 
standard o
