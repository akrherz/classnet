===message:I believe that there is a lot of evidence to support evolution although I also believe in the Bible and creation.  Through science I have begun to believe that it is a combination of both.  I do not feel that it has to be one or the other.  When god said "let there be light," could that also be the "big bang?"  There is evidence from both ideas that seems to follow the same path.  Does anyone agree that is does not have to be one or the other (evolution or creation), and that maybe by putting both of the ideas together, that the "black boxes" in both of the ideas will be filled in?
