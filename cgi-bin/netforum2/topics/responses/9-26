===message:Hi Wes, <P>

I'm afraid I need to ruffle your feathers a little.  What do you mean by saying there is nothing we can do about CO2 emmissions?  And, what is this attitude of "might as well have fun and not worry much about it"?  Come on Wes. I think its time for you to wake up and smell the CO2 (or is CO2 odorless?).  There are plenty of things we can do.  You did mention that we should "make everyone walk", which isn't necessarily a bad idea, but it doesn't seem to be completely practical.  I think we all have to realize that it took a long time for us humans (especially those of us in the United States and other industrialized nations) to develop our bad habits and we are not going to change our habits over night but we can think about all of the decisions that we make in our daily life and start to make decisions that are environmentally friendly.  Start with little decisions and do something every day.  A big, big factor is going to be education.  We need to start educating children when they are young and before they have established bad habits. <P>

I definitely agree with you on the idea that we need to eliminate all of the other pollutants that are emitted into the air by factories and industry, but I doubt that you will be able to convince me that CO2 is not a major problem in the issue of global warming, or that there is nothing worth doing about the problem. <P>

Oh, just wanted to let you know that a herd of fish is actually called a school of fish.  Also, what is the source of your information on those pesky termites? By the way, I vote for leaving those pesky termites alone and changing our blasted nasty habits that got us into this problem in the first place.  One more thing, electricity can be generated by solar photo voltaic technology, to run those pesky little cars so you can still run around town havin' a good ol' time.
