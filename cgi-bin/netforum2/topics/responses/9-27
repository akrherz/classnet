===message:I agree with the "laissez faire" approach that Rohit suggests.  Historical precedent shows that increased governmental regulation actually serves to decrease creativity and initiative, the two qualities perhaps most necessary to resolve the problems of global warming.  Many anecdotal incidents highlight the farcical results of the EPA's meddling in the affairs of citizens.  It is only when there is a clear noncoercive initiative, economic or otherwise, that the greatest reform will occur.
