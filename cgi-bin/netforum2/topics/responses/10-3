<br>	Interesting question and reply.  The answer does involve DNA - specifically WHICH genes in the genome are expressed in each type of cell/stage of development.  So the real question (and a topic on which there is alot of current research) is, HOW do cells know WHICH genes to express?

===message:<P> So genes contol cell differentiation. So then the Genes could be turned off right? Or would inhibitor molecules keep the genes in question from bieng activatied.
Also, if cell diferentiation could go backwards,then you could you make a phloem cell back into a meristem cell, right. then could you grow a whole new plant from that, kinda like clonning.

	Good question!  Genes can be "turned on" and "turned off".  In some cases there are inhibitor molecules (usually proteins) that repress gene expression, in other cases there are activators (again, usually proteins) that induce gene expression.  With regard to "reversing differentiation",  that is possible in some circumstances with plant cells. For example, individual parenchyma cells can often be induced (using the proper hormones) to begin cell division and can regenerate an entire plant - this is in fact a "clone".  For a sieve tube member from the phloem, this would not be possible as, at maturity, sieve tube members lack functional nuclei.
