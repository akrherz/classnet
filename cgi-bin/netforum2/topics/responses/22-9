===message:We had a few disagreements with your argument for scenario 4.
First of all, we disagree with your observation that "more developed" countries have a lower birst rate.  For example take China, one of the most highly developed countries of our time in technology and society.  Yet, look at their population, over 1 billion.  WOW!  We do not think that the population got this large from "lower birth rates"!
In addition, by reducing the population to 3 billion people there will not be enough people to sustain our "developed world". There will be a lot of advancement in technology, hopefully, and more people will be needed to man these positions. Who's going to work at Burger King? 
Finally, more development and technology does not necessarily mean that there will be less strain on the  environment.  Typically, higher development means that there will be more.  More technology in the past has meant a drive to find more resources to deplete and keep that technology going.
