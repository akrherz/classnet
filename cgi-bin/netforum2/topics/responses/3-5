===message:Hi Dr. Ingebritsen!  

I'm a Freshmen majoring in Dietetics here at ISU.  I'm from Washington, IA, which is 30 miles south of Iowa City.  (I admit I'm a Hawkeye fan!)  Of course in Dietetics I have to love food, so I love to cook!  As a stress reliever I'm in Oratorio Choir, Hixson Scholar, ISU Volunteer (I have a soft spot for the elderly when volunteering), and this semester I'll be in the ballroom dancing club.  Other than that I like to go out with my friends. If and when I have spare time I also enjoy the performing and visual arts. (musicals, plays, artwork, ect.)

Keep in touch

===message:Hello, my name is Amy Wall.  I am a senior here majoring in exerise and sport studies with a minor in psychology.  I am taking Bio 202 because I have hopes of getting into a occupational or physical therapy program once I graduate from ISU.  I plan on graduating in December of this year.  I decided to take Bio over the web because I thought it might be an interesting, new experience.

===message:I am from Greene, Iowa, a town of 1300 people.  There were 35
kids in my graduating class.  I am a sophomore in Psychology/
Pre Physical Therapy.  I grew up on a farm, about 12 miles 
Greene.  We raise hogs, which I really don't like working with.
I'm the second of seven children.  I have an older 21 year old
sister, a brother, 17, and sisters 16, 4, 2, and 1.  I help a 
lot with the little ones.  In high school I participated in
cheerleading, band, chorus, theatre, and national honor society.
I value friendships and like to learn about people.

===message:Hello all.
My name is Joy Ward and I am a junior in Horticulture. I am from Ankeny originally. but moved to Ames in 1994. I live here with my husband and two cats, Oliver and Phisher. We have several aquariums, and spend quite a bit of time working on the tanks. I'm also a plant freak (hence the major), so I can usually be found wherever there's chlorophyll. I'm taking this class because I like the independence of choosing my best times to study.

===message:Hi-  My name is Erin. I'm a junior here at ISU.   My majors are Biology and Spanish.  I know you're probably wondering where that combination came from...  I took a year off to study abroad and travel through Central America and decided to put that to practical use by adding another major. 
I grew up here in Iowa near the lakes (Okoboji).  In my free time I like to travel, read, and spend time with my 6 roommates.
