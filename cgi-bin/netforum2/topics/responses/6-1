===message:I agree with Jay that we must first focus on the quality of the life and the lifespan that we already have. With all the diseases killing people everyday we should focus on saving lives rather than prolonging them for many years. A second thought that I had was related to the media and cosmetics world. Perhaps this will be yet another way to make those who are not as fortunate to be able to afford this discovery even less adequate. In a society where how you look is already more important than what you think, this may be the downfall of "What's inside is what counts."
