Not sure that I completely understand your question.  Perhaps it would help to restate the idea:  Archebacteria have more in common with (are more closely related to) eukaryotes than do Eubacteria.  Fungi and animals are more similar to each other (especially at the cell and molecular level) than either group is to plants.  With regard to "how" - the answer, though incompletely known, lies in the evolutionary history of these organisms.
