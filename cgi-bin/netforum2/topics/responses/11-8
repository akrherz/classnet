===message:I agree that Bt-toxin should be used widely so that the pests don't become immuned too quickly everywhere.  Hopefully scientist can research more, making Bt-toxin in corn so strong that ECB can be wiped out, not just partly, when they munch on the corn plants.  The outcome is not for certain though.
