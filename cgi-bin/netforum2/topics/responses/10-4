===message: <P>Well, here whats came to my mind. I was thinking good question, really good question. Then I looked at some pictures on page 684 and got an idea.

	<P>Okay dicots live year after year. So in herbacious plants the  xylem and phloem are around the outside in a circular pattern so that when the plant continues to grow the old and dead plant material can be pushed to the center.  Then Being used for transport of water or support. Well that works great if you have a vascular cambium layer. In monocots all that energy of organizing plant structures is a waste of energy. The plant dies every year anyways.
