Hmmmmm....... you realize, of course, what that approach would mean to intro bio students?  Instead of learning a "handful" of Kingdom/Phylum/Division names - we'd be wanting you learn 1.5 million names (one for each currently described species).  Not a pretty picture......  But, seriously, the important point is that the goal is to understand life on earth - to do that you have put these organisms into an evolutionary context, and that's what clasification is all about.........trying to determine which species are closely related and which are distantly related.  It isn't easy to do that, however.
