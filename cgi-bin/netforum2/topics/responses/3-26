===message:Discussion Proposal 1:  I think that it is the United States obligation to help more needy countries.  Yet, simply giving grain away is not the solution.  People are working very hard for the production of that grain and they need to see a profit from their hard work.  A system of trading and bartering could be set up.  Other materials that these coruntries could give to the united States that would be helpfukl  to us could be given in exchange for the greains or perhaps a political allegiance could be formed with the countries in need.
Discusssion Proposal 2:  I do not think that it is neccessary for the entire U.S. to become vegetarians to solve this problem.  However, people could definitely lower their consumption of meats.  This would help to feed others who are hungry and would also help to improve the overall heath of Americans.
