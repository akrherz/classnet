===message:This scenario is implausible because reducing the current population by half would decrease the genetic diversity.  We can't control which half of the population will be cut so we will be uncertain what skills and knowledge we will lose.  How would there be an increase in technology?  How are you planning on cutting the population in half? This seems like the most unrealistic of all the proposed scenarios.
