Not sure that you can think about this question from the perspective that you imply in your question.  Plants don't "choose" which phase of the life cycle will be prominent....  the point is that having either phase be prominent can be a successful strategy - but the MOST successful plants (in terms of current numbers of species and percent of total biomass), angiosperms,  have the  sporophyte phase prominent.  May have something to do with minimizing the amount of time spent as a haploid organism in which recessive lethal alleles could kill the individual organism.
