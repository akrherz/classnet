===message:We see what you are saying about our planet being on a trend towards scenerio 2, but therein lies the problem and ultimate downfall of the human race.  The world today standing at 5.8 billion people is already vastly overpopulated and the results of this imbalance remain widespread and unpredictable.  The thought of 10 million live and let live happy people running around earth is a rather romantisized dilusion.  Also, how would you provide "comfortable" living conditions to almost twice as many people as exist now when we are already uncapable of this today.  Also, think about food.  Yes, new inventions perhaps reliant on solar power could come into widespread use for energy, but without some major reconstruction of resource consumption and food production, people would be starving right and left.  We believe that new technology will become available to ensure less dependence on our natural resources and put less strain on the environment, but these new techniques of erasing the effects of overpopulation do not solve the real problem, nor will they be inventive enough to lessen damage on ecosystems.  Also consider waste.  What can we do with 10 billion people's waste products?  Recycling is an answer, but not good enough.  It's not even good enough for today's number of people.  You have some good ideas, and as we progress, society and it's technology will progress.  But it needs to progress faster than it ever will if we are to save the already failing biological balance on planet earth.  Adding people will only add more problems that we aren't ready to deal with.  If you are that concerned about letting people copulate at random and reproduce excessively, maybe we should invest in NASA and populating Mars, because this planet is not equipt to deal with such a grotesquely selfish and out of control species.  At this point in the game, it seems like cutting back on reproduction may be "cruel" or "offensive", but we are litterally screwing ourselves into our own extinction.
