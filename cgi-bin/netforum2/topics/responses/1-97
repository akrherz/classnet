To contrast seeds and spores, I would recommend that you go to the "Seed plants" lecture on Darwin.  <br>
<br>

Antheridogens promote "out-crossing" by providing a situation in which the egg and sperm come from separate gametophtyes.  These gametophytes, at least potentially are derived from spores produced by distinct sporophytes.  The mechanism by which antheridogens affect gametophyte development is unknown.
