Very hard, if not impossible, to answer how it evolved...... it was simply one of the earliest succesful body plans for vascular plants......  In terms of advantages/disadvantages, I've not seen any data on this issue, but I would hypothesize that one advantage might be minimization of water loss due to small surface area.  One disadvantage might be lower levels of photosynthesis due to small surface area.
