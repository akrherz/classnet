===message:It is very clear that ultimately more efficient technology is the key to reducing harmful emissions from automobiles. I don;t believe that these governments and corporations are going to fund the development of these technologies out of the goodness of their hearts, nor is the average consumer (not those who are posting on this bulletin board !) going to be willing to pay hundreds of after-tax dollars to buy cleaner automobiles. A good "carrot and stick policy" -steady tightening of environmental standards balanced with economic incentives for consumers(for example, you get to write off part of the purchase/maintenance costs of a "green car" off your taxes - this will stimulate demand for the cars and encourage the manufacturers to produce more of them) would be a good starting point. But in the meanwhile, watch for hordes of lobbyists and their experts lining up outside Washington to prove that such economic incentives are ultimately detrimental to our economy ... more creative energy is typically spent in fighting legislation than in figuring out how best to comply ...
