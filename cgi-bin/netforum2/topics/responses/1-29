The assumptions (e.g., far more offspring than survive to reproduce) made in Darwin's concept of natural selection are certainly  "basic rules" now.  What Darwin didn't know was anything about the mechanism of transfer of genetic information, or the idea of how catastrophic events (e.g., large meteor impacts) might cause mass extinction, followed by rapid speciation among the survivors.
