I'm guessing that by "three kingdom system" you are referring to panel (c) of Fig 24.10.  That system is actually proposing three "domains" (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya).  Domains are a taxon at a higher level than Kingdoms.  Presumably, the Domain Eukarya would be subdivided into four (or more) Kingdoms.
