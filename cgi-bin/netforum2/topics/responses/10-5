===message:I understand that a companion cell is a specialized parenchyma cell that is connected to a sieve-tube member.  (A sieve-tube member is a chain of cells forming tubes in the phloem of a plant.) They are elongated, thin-walled, and have a distinct nucleus in the cytoplasma.  Companion cells are linked with sieve-tube members by small, cytoplasma filled tubes, which are smaller than pits. <P>
I couldn't find an explanation how companion cells help the phloem, but I'm guessing that it helps with the transportation of sugar?<P>

	Companion cells particpate in a process called "phloem loading" - essentially this is active transport (uses ATP) of sucrose into the sieve tube members.
