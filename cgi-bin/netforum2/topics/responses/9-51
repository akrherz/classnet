===message:Many of the solutions, like this one, suggest planting new trees. However, this overlooks the fact that it takes many years for trees to grow and in the mean time, the problem will worsen. In addition, where are these trees supposed to be planted? Much of the land fertile enough for trees is used for farming, housing development or other uses. It's not simply empty waiting for trees to be added.
