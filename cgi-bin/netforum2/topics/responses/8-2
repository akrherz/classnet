===message:Did this article state any advantages of using bacteriocins compared to the current method of killing bacteria on food? If this is an expensive way of killing microbes in food, then why pay more for a process that (I assume) takes more time, energy, and money?

===message:I'm assuming that the main reason to pursue this form of food preservation is because it is Natural.  Instead of adding a potentially carcinogenic man-made material to the food, we use natures means of preservations.  While it is supposed to be expensive, I would imagine that those people who already spend more money on "organically grown" foodstuffs would possibly be willing to spend more money for "naturally preserved" foodstuffs as well.
