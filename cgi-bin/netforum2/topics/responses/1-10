I'm not quite sure that I understand your question.  The binomials are made from Latin (or latinized) words.  Generally the names reflect something about the organisms (e.g. the saccharum of Acer saccharum means "sugar"), where the organisms are found (e.g., Ulmus americana - American Elm), or who discovered the organisms (e.g., Crataegus mackenzii - a species of hawthorne named by K.K. MacKenzie, 1877-1934).  Hope that helps.
