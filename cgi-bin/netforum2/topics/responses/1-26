Well.......... there would be lots of discussion, many papers published, probably a fair amount of controversy - but, if in the end, the observations/experiments with this new type of organism were repeatable by numerous biologists, either the definition of an existing Kingdom would be expanded, or a new Kingdom would be instituted.  Suppose that living organisms were found on one of the moons of Jupiter - would you expect that they would fit neatly into one of the Kingdoms we've defined here on Earth?
