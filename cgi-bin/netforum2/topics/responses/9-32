===message: <P>Now I agree with you about the cars. They obviously create lots and lots of CO2.  I seem to remember a report about  this inventor that developed a way to mesure the cars emotions as it drove by a sensor. the device then Took a picture of the a cars license plate. The thinking was that 10% of cars create 80% of harmful emotions. this device would then allow law enforcement to require individuals to clean up their car’s act or revoke a drivers license. Of course I was of this nature would have to be passed but nothing ever came of the invention. There were also reports of a prototype car that could run at 80 miles per gallon. Although I never saw this demonstrated, as I did with the other device.

<P>One thing i’m not sure I agree about is your plan for cold fusion. We might as well be searching for element 115. (The fuel for rumored alien craft at area 51.)  Sure scientist have said an element of that weight  <B>MAY</B> be stable, and they also said cold fusion <B>MAY</B> be possible, but it seems like a wild goose chase to me.  There must be other alternatives.  One of the more peculiar use a completely independent Robot system located in a desert of some type. Only a few robots would be made. Then they would create solar panels to catch light, and oven to heat the sand into usable elements to make more solar panels and robots. It is really an interesting read. I suggest you read it. You can find it the the    October 1995 issue of <U>Discover Magazine</U>. the title is <U>Robot, build theyself </U>

	<p> I agree with almost everything you said in your message.  Even if we discover this mythical enegry power.  Won't the problem of global warning stay arise.  It seems to me that mankind treated the world like garbage and no we all must pay the price.  Almost all of our energy sources produces waste gases that hurt the ozone, so we can only hope for a miracle to solve our problems
