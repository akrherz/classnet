Hmmmm......... very tough question to answer - particularly if you don't have easy access to a "time machine"......The extinction of the dinosaurs is paralleled by the extinction of many gymnosperm species (especially cycads and conifers) and the continued diversification of the flowering plants. (although flowering plants were quite abundant before the extinction as well).  Why might plants be affected differently than dinosaurs?  My guess is that many plants produce seeds that are capable of remaining dormant for long periods of time - I doubt that was true of dinosaur eggs.....
