Frightening question - partly because nobody really KNOWS what would happen to planet earth
if the rain forests are destroyed. Certainly, we would lose a great deal of biodiversity - much of
which we wouldn't even know we had lost (i.e., species not yet named/studied). There might
also be other changes, including impacts on the climate - i.e., changes in rainfall patterns, etc.
