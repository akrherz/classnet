Whoa!  Now that's a bunch of questions.......<br>
<br>
What are the most widely accepted theories about the evolution of chlorophyll in early
autotrophs?   - I don't know.......<br>
<br>
What exactly composes this complex molecule and is it theorized that when animals
and plants "split" that the heterotrophs lost this pigment, or did animals simply never have
chlorophyll in the first place? <br>
<br>

Look at Figs 10.8 and 26.26. <br>
<br>
Were the earliest autotrophs capable of sexual reproduction, or is
that mostly an advanced reproductive mechanism? <br>
<br>

Sexual reproduction appears to be an early event in the evolution of eukaryotes, including autoptrophs.  The earliest autotrophs, of course, were prokaryotes - which don't exhibit sexual reproduction, though they do have mechanisms to achieve exchange of genetic information. <br>
<br>
What are some theories on the development of
carnivorous plants and how are they thought to have evolved? <br>
Carnivory among plants is an adaptation to nitrogen-poor environments.
