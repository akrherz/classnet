       First, remember that the suggestion of an "undigested prey" mechanism is just that - a
       suggestion. No one knows for sure. Second, consider this. If an undigested "prey"
       cyanobacterium is present in the cytoplasm of cell what might it do? One thing it might
       do is reproduce (via binary fission) so that there are now numerous cyanobacteria inside
       of the cell. When the cell divides by mitosis (or some more primitive process) followed
       by cytokinesis it is certainly possible that some of the cyanobacteria would be present in
       each daughter cell. If possessing the cyanobacteria had some advantage (e.g.,
       production of sugar with light energy), you might expect that such individuals would
       have an adaptive advantage, at least in some environments.
