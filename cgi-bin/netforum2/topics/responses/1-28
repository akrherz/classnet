Hmmmmm ........ not entirely sure that I understand your question.  Simply touching a fungus would not be enough to cause, for example, the decay of skin on your finger.  But, if the fungus is capable of infecting humans, touching the fungus might allow an ifection to begin in which case the fungus would derive its nutrition by degrading some component of your body.  E.g., think about an example like "athletes foot".  <br>
