===message:Kevin Schulte and Carolyn Kenyon.  We don't necessarily agree with this scenario, because if there is 3 billion people and they are living to the standards of "developed" countries, they will be using TONS of resources and fossil fuels.  SO, these resources will eventually run out causing major problems for the survival of humans.
