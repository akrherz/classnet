Not sure that I know the answer.  Your mom is allergic to either the penicillin antibiotic itself, or some other substance (perhaps a protein) derived from the Penicillium fungus that contaminates antibiotic preparations.  You may or may not be allergic yourself - allergic responses are genetically determined - you know, meiosis, syngamy, recombination and all that.
