===message:Mr. Patak you would not want to know if your last waining days are approaching? Wouldn't you want to live those days to the fullest or would you prefer to spend them (I can only assume)lounging about playing playstation, and pretending you can play basketball?  I would think you would rather spend them on a beach sipping margaritas and hanging with senioritas.
