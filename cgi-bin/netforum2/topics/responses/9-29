===message:	I, too, agree that it would be good to have more carbon 
dioxide absorbing items in the environment to keep it out of 
the atmosphere, but I think that putting potted plants along 
streets and stuff may be a bit far-fetched.  Planting trees 
along these streets, thought, may have more of an impact.<P>
