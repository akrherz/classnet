===message:You are right about people not understanding the effects of the greenhouse gases on the animals that inhabit this planet.  It seems that many people seem to think that if we don't do anything about what is going on, that the earth itself will die.  But I think you would agree (as others have) that that is not the case.  Humans will die, animals will die, but the earth will remain (along with the roaches).  I just wish there was a way to so what the next ruling species of the earth is going to be.  From Plants, Insects, Dinosaurs, Humans... ???     I don't think we will last either.
