===message:I think we as a culture and human race have already decided that we don't want to kill the planet or ourselves, and we
have taken action by recycling and even having earth day 
once a month.  Only problem is most people don't stick with it long enough to actually help, we get all geared up for earth day and once the day is over so are our thoughts on saving the planet.
