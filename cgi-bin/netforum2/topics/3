===message:In my opinion, I think it would be okay to take something 
from another country if was going to cure a disease that has had the medical field stumped for the longest time. I don't know how it could be considered unethical if you are trying to save the lives of millions of people.
Scientists help each other out by giving each other their data and conclusions
so that we do not make the same mistake again, also saving everyone the money and time.  
But on the other hand, if it was a product, like a computer chip or something like that, thats 
when the questions come if it is ethical or not to steal the technology from 
another country. When we are talking about stealing a product just to make money, that would be wrong.
I guess it depends on how the product was used either for the good of the human race
or if it was used just for self satisfaction of glory and fame.

===message:What do we do?  We have a problem.  Should we accept people 
who take from others for the betterment of the society as
a whole....Who knows.  Look at it this way.  If I were to make some miracle product or drug and I sold it
as a source of income for myself...and a big corporation 
got a hold of what I was doing...then some how duplicated my
good and decided to sell it for a cheaper price than I was
selling it for...just so I could break even with very little
profit.  Now this corporation is making it for less and charging 
just under my cost so that people will but it and they make a 
huge profit.  You know what...I'm out of a job.  What do I do now?

===message:	It is very hard to choose a topic and decide if it is unethical or not because everyone has a different set of moral values.  When talking about ethics there are so many different views on why people have come to their set of values.  Pressures from society, parents, religion and possible inate morals vary so much that it is almost impossible to delegate what is ethical and what is not.  If gaining knowledge and using it to help people-kind, if that knowledge is gained from someone else, is ethical or not is hard to say.  If there is a cure for cancer lingering in the tribes in Africa or in Latin America it would seem against human nature not to use it to help everyone.  But, with that in mind, what about nuclear weapons?  If terrorists can get wind of how to make nuclear warheads is that unethical?  Should everyone be allowed to know how to make them?  Ethics on these issues would change according to each different situation.  But, when each situation comes up, who gets to decide which ones are good and which ones are bad.  Human nature is also prone to exploiting knowledge in order to acheive personnal objectives.  I am not one to believe that finding a cure for AIDS or cancer would be wrong, even if it meant taking knowledge from a tribal group not able to gain the profits that a large corporation would gain from selling the cure.  But if you look at that senerio is it ethical for a large corporation to make a profit off of curing millions of people of a terminal illness?  Each person will just have to decide for his or her self what is right and what is not.  Unfortunately the people who are in control the buisness world are the people whose personnal ethics are put on everyone else.  Is it ethical that Nike should be allowed to use children in sweatshops to make shoes because it is cheeper than having expensive Union factory workers put them together in the US?  Is it ethical that people knowing Nike does this, will still buy their shoes?  Where is the line?  I feel that as long as people can get up in the morning at look at themselves in the mirror without feeling guilty or ashamed of who they are than whatever moral choices each person makes are the most ethical choices they can make at any given time in their lives.

===message:Ethics to me is a very hard thing to discuss because people have very different values on a lot of things,  I feel a lot of this comes from the way we were raised and the society we come from.  When we had the discussion in class about people finding a drug that can cure cancer, but people in Mexico already knowing about it and sharing it with us for the better of our society I have a very hard time with people making money off of this because they got there first and these people not seeing a dime.  This will always go on in the world whether it is ethical or not.

===message:What is ethical or unethical depend on your personal moral.  It could also depend on how you were raise as kid when growing up.  What real matter is how majority agree is it ethical or unethical.  To me, if there ever a chance to save million of lives I would do it and it would be an ethical to me.

===message:You are right that ethics is a hard topic to discuss, but I
believe that it is  very important when talking about the
world coming together in a "global community".  Everyone has
his/her own set of values and standards that come from their
backgrounds and experiences.  But what about those standards
of right and wrong that are shared by so many people, and 
others that conflict?  Will there be in the future an
imaginary "Book of Shared World Standards" that everyone in 
the global village will agree to live by?  Who will decide 
what the most important standards will be?  These are the
same type of questions that are asked about other topics that
are changing with the world - i.e. technology, human rights,
politics, etc.  I can see in the future conflicts arising 
over ethics.  Will it be possible for us to live in our global
community in peace without a set of shared values and standards?
