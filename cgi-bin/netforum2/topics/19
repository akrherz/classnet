===more:I have a few questions about the issues with sex in the military and how it has been handled with lately.Why are persons (man\women) in the military, being dismissed are asked to resign when it is found out that they have had relations with married poeple outside of the military ranks?  Is this because it would give the impression that the military breeds its personal to sleep with anyone or something along this nature?  Why is it the military's problem who its personal are sleeping with after they are done with work.  Iam positive that this type of behavior has been going on in any military thoughout the world, but why is it just becoming a issues now?

===message:Some of the stuff that's come out regarding sex in the 
military is questionalble. I think the drill sargeant at 
Aberdeen was a pretty serious situation. Overall, I guess 
if it's illegal for civilians, it should be illegal for
the army guys and gals. However, all this attention to 
extra-marital affairs is completely rediculous, especially in the case of a service person with a civilian. 
First of all,is it really anybody's business, secondly I think half the 
people that are raising the stink have done the same thing. 
Although I don't have any statistics to back this up, I 
would imagine that if they decided to take disciplinary action
against everyone who had been involved in an indiscretion, 
there wouldn't be that many left. Just to clarify, I'm not stating explicitly that this is right or wrong, I just think it's nobody's business but the people involved.

===message:     To most civilians the military has often been looked down upon and very confusing to understand.  To the press it is a haven for spotlighting only the bad further pulling any good the military possesses.  It is true I believe that you have to be in the military to trully understand it.  I have spent four long years of my life in the Air Force.  I have been places and have seen things most people would never believe, that is why I often refrain from saying much about it.  It may be too hard to understand it, after all reality is a very ugly thing.  War is one of those realities and in war you need a certain code of conduct.  That is why there is a need for rules and regulations.  There has to be a sense of order and trust.  Those that serve have voluntarily given up half there rights that civilians take for granted.  The first day I enlisted I gave up my right to free speech, no longer could I say what I wanted when I wanted.  This is a very necessary evil to establish order.  Without this order, people would be unable to follow.  This sense of order or law is outlined in what is called the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  It is very clear that the military has to live up to a higher standard of living.  Civilians have to understand that those in the armed forces are government property.  If ordered to go to war and fight I would have no choice.  If military people were given certain priveledge of choices like these it would remain in chaos.  That is why adultery does not help anyone in the military.  The military must maintain profesional standards.  Adultery will only cause distrust and distention in the ranks.  Moral problems are hard enough and if adultery were allowed it would cause more problems amongst its people who have to work and may have to fight and die for each other.

===message:The military mentality is stuck in the 50's (I for one
think that this is a good thing, but that is just my opinion).
They believe in the ideals of American society, the family
first, serve your country and family with honor, respect those
both above, below as well as those equal to you, be willing
to give your life for the ideals and honor of your country.
Just look at the Marines, their moto is Semper Fi, always 
faithful. You sure as hell are not being always faithful if
you're involved in sexual relations with someone's spouse. By
commiting adultry, you are betraying your country, your fellow
military and most importantly the public. These problems that
are arrising about sex and the military are not because these
soldiers are having sex, they are arrising because these 
soldiers are commiting a crime and a sin. That Flinn woman 
was being persecuted because she slept with an enlisted woman's
husband and she was an officer. And not only did she commit 
adultry, when she was originally confronted about the issue
she lied about the affair and said she would break it off and
did not do so. She deserved to be dishonorably discharged,
no matter if she was a man, woman or whatever, she was a liar
and an adulterer. She may have been a talented and intelligent 
woman and I do respect her for her accomplishments in the
military, but her actions clearly showed she was not suited
to military life. Besides if little things were disregarded,
where do we set the limit? The military is there to serve a 
purpose, and to serve that purpose strict discipline is 
necessary. IF the military regulates how your belt buckles 
are arranged on your shelf, what would make you think that 
they wouldn't regulate what types of behaviors are acceptable?
Besides these people knew what they were doing was wrong and
what the consequences would be if they were caught and yet 
they did them anyway.
