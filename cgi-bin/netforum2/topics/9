===message:In my opinion, just because we are taught to believe or accept something in our culture, it does not make it right or the only way of doing things.
I mean when the Timothy McVeigh verdict was going to be aired Fridy afternoon on national televsion and how he was going to be punished, I just think that some countries would consider that to be wrong, just as we think there's is wrong as well.
We are taught to believe that we are right in everything that we do.  But just because some where else something is not done exactly how we do it, we consider it totally backwards and inhumane to treat a human being that way. 
I am not saying that he does not deserve the verdict he recived, I am just saying that televising it live for millions of people to see and hear, and then seeing people celebrate it, just does not give us the right to judge any other country's culture.

===message:I agree that for the most part, we do not have the right to judge others' cultures as our culture is far from perfect.
However, in spite of the fact that our media makes a circus out of sensational trials such as the McVeigh case or O.J. Simpson, our freedom of the press exposes both the good and the ugly side of our culture.
In many cultures of the world, practices which totally abuse human rights can be kept suppressed.  I wonder if televised public stonings of women found to be guilty of adultery wouldn't create more world criticism instead of just accepting that as a part of their culture.

===message:Because we have such a diverse culture, I think that many 
Americans feel that we have both the right and responsibility 
to judge and interfere in a selfish way other cultures in other countries.
Our own history has shown that we are a very judgemental
people.  The Timmothy McVeigh trial is a good example.  With 
this trial I kind of got the feeling that wether he was in fact guilty or 
not, he would have been found guilty anyway.  The crime that he 
allegedly committed was such an abomination, that somebody 
was going to get punished for this.

===message:On the topic of judgment and how it pertains to trials, this country seems to have always been really trial happy.  The Limbergh baby case in the '20s, the trial of the couple in the '50s convicted for treason and selling secrets to the Soviets (I forget their names), right up to the William Kennedy Smith trial, Rodney King, and OJ, we CANNOT get enough of them!  There is an entire CHANNEL on some cable systems devoted to judging and sentencing our criminals (Court TV).  What sort of obsession is this?  Do many Americans simply like to physically watch their peers kneel at the mercy of the judicial system?  Who knows.  Interesting fact: the US has six percent of the world's population, but HALF of the world's lawyers.  We as Americans cannot get enough of judgment!!!

===message:There is no way to ever take judgement away from humans.  We as a race counld not exist without it.  Yes maybe there are problems with the media getting involved in trials and whether a truely unbiases juror could ever be chosen but these things are superficial in the grand scheme of life.  I think that particularily in the United States we are (not to step on any toes) winers.  We are very loud winers at that.  This is not a bad thing, we have the freedom to live a "fair" life full of "equal opportunities"  so I think that this country's obsession with the judgement of others is because we don't want anyone to get away with anything that is not fair.  Again not to get into trouble here, I beleive that even with all of the smoke and mirrors involved in trials and the sentences that come out of them don't really mean anything because there is only one true judge (in whatever form) in this world and everything else is just a bunch of humans running trying to control other people.  ( Look  by writting on this topic we are judging judgement there is no escaping it.)

===message:"THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE."  Anybody that hasn't heard this song either isn't from here or is not into nationalism.  It is our duty to judge those who have allegedly done wrong.  In order to live freely, we must live without fear.  We can't do this if we always have to look over our shoulder because we can't judge anyone.  Years ago, because our trials were not in depth, many innocent people lost their lives.  Granted that this still goes on today, we cannot be expecting to be perfect with trials all the time, but now our trials are so in depth because we want to give everyone the greatest opportunity to prove guilt or innocence.  As far as judging other countries, we have no right unless they harm us.  If they do we must be rational at all times to try to keep as much peace as what can be retained.  We look like a big bully.  Sometimes we really are.  Then other times we have trials such as the Tanya Harding case and the OJ Simpson case that just makes are judicial system look like seaweed.
