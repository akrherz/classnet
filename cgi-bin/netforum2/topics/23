===more:All I can say is ouch!  Hey gals! How would you like to be sewn up and then taken apart again by get this, not a doctor but a cashier or a waiter.  No wonder so many people die from infections from this stuff.  Woo!  I'm sure glad I'm not from this type of culture.  I couldn't go on if I had to wait until I was married.  I'm just teasing.  It sounds like pure agony which I never want to be a part of.  I try thinking why women would get this done and all I can think of is fathers don't trust their daughters, they don't want to be tempted to sin the unthinkable, and because maybe they want to torture themselves.  We have no right to tell these people to stop doing this but we can cringe whenever somebody talks about it.  I also think that these people that are getting this stuff done are thinking from somewhere other than their brains.

===message:   I really don't think that it's possible to judge the
cultures that preform these surguries by our own standards.
If anything, these should be government regulated so that 
the sanitary measures and the welfare of the recipient can 
be monitored. Also, why is male circumcision an acceptable
practice and female isn't. If anything, this could be tacked
up to female equality. Women talk about wanting equal rights,
equal treatment, well here we are.
