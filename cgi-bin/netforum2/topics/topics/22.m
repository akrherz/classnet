===message:Our reasons for choosing scenario four are as follows:
By having 3 billion humans, we have predicted that we over use our supply of natural resources, and also will lessen the chance of damage to the environment.  A developed world is also ideal because of technology.  Water treatment, health resources, and other advances will help preserve the initial state of the earth better than a "lesser developed" one would.
Biodiversity, also, is an essential condition; it guarantees foods (both plant and animal) are still available, therefore sustaining the basic food chain or web. The additional new species will help replenish the 15% of resources that were lost.

===message:   Our group has chosen scenario 4.  We feel this scenario would most benefit future generations of humanity.  With 3 billion people, everyone would have a high standard of living, and there would be plenty of resources to rebuild.  The world as a whole would be highly developed, which is essential to the conservation of the remaining resources.  Economically, it is more feasable for developed countries to protect the planet from pollution and exploitation of resources than less developed countries who must be concerned with mere survival.
    
    This scenario would also provide for the survival of the largest number of species.  If fewer were to survive, essential organisms would be destroyed, resulting in the destruction of all the world's ecosystems, and ultimately, the end of mankind.  It is impossible for us to know which species are "keystones" of ecosystems until they have disappeared and the system collapses.  
    
     This scenario will result in the long-term survival of the largest number of people with the highest standard of living.

===message:	Scenerio 4 is obviously the most desirable if it could truly be reached by the yeat 2098.  It involves a cut of over 2.5 billion people from today's human population.  This would nearly cut our population in half and bring our inflated species down to a more ecologically balanced 3.0 billion.  It would be difficult to curb out the current growth rate and accomplish a decline in population, however, this is the most desirable and necessary step in saving the biodiversity of the planet and eventually the human race as well.  The planet cannot support as many humans as exist now for any extended period of time, and if our over-used resources are to ever be replenished, we must cut back on our numbers and abuse of the environment.  Over population is the root cause of numerous worldwide problems including pollution, contamination of water supplies, starvation, disease, extinction, and ozone depletion.  As E.O. Wilson describes in "The Biodiversity of Life," we are changing the world we live in by altering the climate, composition, and biodiversity that resides here as our species overpopulates the planet and selfishly devours resources for human consumption.
	Also in Scenerio 4, 85% of current day biodiversity remains, which is economically important for supporting our needs for food, fuel, fiber, and medicine.  We will never know what the species of the world have to offer or how they may evolve if we extinguish them with our careless activities.  Humans cannot exist without the biodiversity we evolved from and continue to rely on.  The true value of nature goes far beyond human use or even understanding, therfore we must preserve and protect as muh as possible while bringing our population back down into a naturaly environmental balannce.

===message:     By the year 2098, we believe that the future of Planet Earth as determined by a group of scientific advisors, will be most closely related to scenario 2, where 10 billion humans will live like developed countries, and maintain 10% of current day biodiversity.


     

     We selected scenario 2, because we felt it was an adequate compromise between limiting lives and resources. We opted to cut lives back to 10 million. However we felt that it would be a greater shift to live any other way than what was normally expected, which was like a developed country, so we chose to remain with good comfortable living conditions.  Although there is a flaw to our selected scenario, only 10% of the biodiversity of Planet Earth will remain. However unfortunate this may seem, we believe that conditions of life will still be maintained and that we will just have to cut back, do without, and find new ways to obtain our resources. Things have not always been this convenient for humans, so we believe that we can go back to the primitive ways of obtaining resources and still manage to live comfortably. We also feel that by the year 2098, it wouldn't be so surprising if we came up with replacements for our resources anyway.




     We believe that the other groups which selected scenario 4 are being unrealistic. Although their scenario will work just as good as ours, they have to figure in exactly how they will go about eliminating such a large amount of people. Not only by what means will they eliminate them, but also how they will select those to be eliminated. It's beginning to not sound like America to us.  Yes those 3 million will live comfortably like a developed country and they will have 85% of their biodiversity left, at what cost to society will all that be. We feel it is a far greater cost to society to eliminate lives than it is to go without some of our resources we have become far too dependent on anyway.

Finally, 85% of the present biodiversity would be needed to sustain a balanced ecosystem.  Although this scenario shows less developed countries as being part of the of an ideal future, it is the only way in which a balance could be maintained between the population and the resources, while supporting diverstiy.

	The loss of 15 percent of our biodiversity by 2093 seems large, but if you consider that on our current course we will lose 20% of our planets diversity by 2020. Scenario four reduces that number by 5 percent, as well as slowing the result by 70+ years.

	Also, reducing the population to 3 billion would require either a severe natural disaster or an aggressive program to curtail the birth rate, which is not practicable and would go against many people's consciences.  The 3 billion people living at current developed nations' standards would probably pollute the planet and consume its resources so whatever biodiversity we maintained will be used up in the years to follow. 
	Our 10 billion people will be able to preserve the high biodiversity because of the lower standard of living.  We do not believe that this precludes a decent level of technology, comfort, or the advancement of scientific knowledge.  This depends on what technology we chose - more necessities and fewer luxuries.  To maintain an equilibrium, the world must be in a peaceful state to supply all peoples with food, water, energy, etc.

Victor Van Laar
<br>
	Our group has chosen to implement scenario 2.  We believe that this scenario has various strengths that make it a good choice for the future of mankind and planet Earth.  First we feel that it is important that everyone has a high standard of living equivalent to modern-day developed countries.  By having this high standard of living, future generations will not only be able to sustain themselves, but also sustain their habitat.  Even as we can easily observe today, good society development and living standards are best for the growth of stable societies and stable minds.
Second, we do not see the 10 billion human population as a problem, but as a benefit.  With such a large number of people, there will be enough people for both labor work to continually advance human technology and for constant interaction.  Interaction among humans is important because it provides for entertainment, academic gatherings, and large, structured families—i.e. A world of Joy!
Finally, the great loss of biodiversity is striking, but is not ultimately detrimental to the human race.  Humans will still have all the species necessary.  Also, with such a large number of people, future generations will have the ability to watch over those species better, both to guard against their drop in numbers and to guarantee their existence, especially for our survival.  True, the loss of the biodiversity will inevitably cause various ecosystems to crash in nature, making the job of species preservation difficult.  To remedy this, though, man can create "bio-spheres" to preserve the ecosystems of the biodiversity remaining.  This will at least keep the ecosystems of necessary species from crashing.

According to E.O. Wilson, "Biological diversity is the key to the maintenance of the world..."          In a developed country the reproduction rate is lower so the population growth will be slower.  Living in developed countries will also meet the needs that many humans are accustomed to today such as food, running water, clothing, shelter, and entertainment.  Being developed allows for more efficient use of resources and therefore causes less of a strain on the environment.

===subject:Scenario 2
===message:If our group was in charge of the future of Planet Earth, we would choose to implement Scenario 2 because it is the most plausible solution to our current problems.  We realize that the current exponential growth of the human population must be drastically slowed down.  This will inevitably happen by either starvation, widespread disease, or a decision by the human race as a whole to lower birthrates; population control will definitely occur, even though it may be involuntary.  We also feel that the estimated biodiversity remaining is the best possible projection for the future of our species because every species currently utilized by the human race will be present.  Even though some species that might be beneficial to humans either directly or indirectly may become extinct, humans have proven themselves to be adaptable to almost any environment, including places with very little food or water, such as the desert.  Therefore, humans will find a way to survive, especially if they are living at the level of a developed country as was stated in Scenario 2.


Our group ruled out the three other scenarios for various reasons.  In Scenario 1, the earth would be far too overpopulated to sustain itself for long, especially with the reduced level of biodiversity, and the people would be living at a level of function that is lower than that of developed countries today.  In Scenario 3, there would be more biodiversity and an optimal population, but the standard of living would go down.  We felt that this was unacceptable because the point of trying to coexist with other species is to maintain the current standards exhibited by both populations; we should not go back in time.  Scenario 4 was rejected because the population is only a little more than half of the current population on Earth.  To achieve this, there would have to be almost no new births between now and 2098, which is a very undesirable situation.  For these reasons, we believe that Scenario 2 is the best option for the human race.

===message:     Scenario 4 is clearly the best option.  3 billion humans is half of the population that exists now.  Already this planet is experiencing overcrowding.  Also with the countries all being "developed", the population is more likely to be educated, have fewer children, and get married later.  These "developed", educated countries would then be able to prevent future overcrowding.  Through education and recycling, the 85% of biodiversity remaining could in fact be kept forever and become new sources of medicine, food, new products, and biological stability for the entire planet.  The planet itself could become healthier with the decreased pollution due to less people and better technology gained over the years by the work of many developed countries.  The down side to this scenario is that the human population would have to experience some sort of disaster to decrease its numbers down to half.  However, diseases, such as AIDS, natural disasters, plagues, cancers, and accidents are all increasing with the increase of human population.  So, it is not totally impossible that humans could see this low population number again.

While it is good that 85% of current day biodiversity remains, it is a problem that you have ten billion humans living at a standard of living that is equivalent to current day "less-developed" countries.  This circumstance in itself is going to encourage disease and cause a very gruesome and painful population crash.  This scenario just maintains our current problems, and the lack of technological advances is going to deplete the natural resources, not increase them.  As was mentioned in The Diversity of Life, it is our current technology today that is allowing us to curb our usage of natural resources by using them more efficiently.  To destroy this technology would ultimately destroy what resources we have left.

===message:If our group were able to decide the fate of the future based on one of the four presented scenarios, we would choose Scenario 3. This is because people in less developed countries are more resourceful and frugal with their resources.  Because of this factor, resources would remain readily available for future generations.  The United States is considered to be the most developed nation in the world today and we use more and waste more resources than all the other nations combined. If this trend continued, the available rescources will depleted because of developed countries culture promotes waste.  By lowering the standard of living the consumtion rate would be decreased drastically, and humankind will be able to live farther into the future.  Scenarios 1, with it thirty billion people and 10% biodiversity would be infeasible because with that number of people there is no way the resources would last.Scenario 2 is also ridiculous because the diversity is low, the number of people is high, and their consumtion rate is high because of their standard of living.  Scenario 4 have an advantage of low population, but at what cost?  I don't know about you, but we feel that it is just a little unethical to kill off three billion people.

The species left on earth would include those used for people for food, fuel, fiber, and pharmaceuticals including those to be used in some new way.    These resources would be used in small amouts due to the small population giving them time to produce more and not wiping the species off the planet.  The animals would be able to resume their natural habitats taken over by people and live the way that they should.  Kids in the future would now what animals share their planet.

There is also a greater possibility for another species to replace it.  Lastly, there's more competition for limited resources which promotes natural selection and can lead to the prevention of overpopulation by species.  Another thing to consider is that with a "developed" country there is more access to things like medicines and forms of birth control that can help regulate the birth and death rates.

Developed countries will be far less dependant on natural resources because new technologies for the production of electricity and other utilities will be developed by 2098. The scenario sheet states that animals are being used in new ways by humans. Certainly in 100 years, new means of producing the things developed countries require will have been developed. Take solar energy or fusion as an example. Developed countries will be much safer for both Earth and its' inhabitants, as these countries tend to be more healthy. As history has proven, less-developed countries tend to have a much higher birth rate because of a lack of birth control. In order to continue as a species, humans must at the very least control themselves and not drastically increase the population. Population control would be much more attainable in a develped country.

One of the possible flaws in our scenario is the noted 
decrease in the human population.  Yet this can also be 
viewed as a negative consequence of a decrease in resources 
available and the all too rapid expansion of the human race.  
Our scenario allows for the preservation of these rare

We feel that by implementing a strong contraceptive awareness program with as limited reproductive regulation as possible, we an slow the exploding population growth without killing people off.  We also felt an ever-present need to maintain as much biodiversity as possible while allowing countries to become "developed" so they can learn to utilize materials more efficiently.
