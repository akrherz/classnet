So your stuck along the highway, your car is overheating.  When lifting the hood to look for that thing where you should put the coolant, it suddenly closes on you leaving you in pain with a car that doesn't work.  The muscles in your back are in pain, but you can't for the life of you remember what those muscles those are called.  You suddenly think to yourself, I should have used INNER BODY ONLINE, the only place on the internet where you can learn both HUMAN AND AUTOMOTIVE ANATOMY!!!  <<P>>

All i have to say is this site is just awesome!!  I have literally spent almost and hour playing around with it and i have learned so much.  (..and i am sounding like and infomercial...=)...)  The grapics are great, it is very informative.  There is information and pictures and descriptions of absolutely anything and everything you want to know about the human body.  You can either go through this program using a little anatomy lesson or you can cruise through the interactive body on your own. You can go through 10 different body systems.  There are animations that i haven't even gotten too yet.  You can even go under search and search for a particular topic or part of the body! <<P>> 
I highly encourage you to go through this, just because its neat, or atlest keep it on file because this site would be a great reference tool.<<P>>

As far as the AUTOMOTIVE anatomy....i'm about to go there...my dad would be very proud if he knew i knew how to even GET the hood open to look at the rest of the car!

"The Whole Brain Atlas," is web site that maps the brain.  The site was developed by Keith A. Johnson M.D. from Harvard and J. Alex Becker from MIT.  The site has hundreds of images of the brain.  One section lists 106 structures in the brain and maps them all on individual links.  Affects of aging on the brain are discussed and shown.  Another section has images of brains affected by many types of afflictions including cerebrovascular disease (stoke), cerebral hemorrhaging, neoplastic disease (brain tumor), degenerative diseases (i.e. Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease), inflammatory or infectious diseases (i.e. multiple sclerosis AIDS dementia).

It also gives an intersting way in which this sort of transplant can be made possible.  Presently it is extremely hard to find a success story when transplanting animal organs into humans.  Our immune systems attack an animal organ because our bodies recognize this new organ as a huge infection and it is destroyed or rejected.  However there is hope, scientist have been studying a way to customize organs by introducing human genesinto the animal's organ to make it less foreign to the human's body.  This web site helped me understand organs better by relating the effectiveness of organ transplants with our immune system and our genes.  I did have one question; Does our immune system act on foreign bodies only because it doesn't recognize the genes in that object?This site was easy to use mostly because it was only text.

===message:http://curry.edschool.Virginia.EDU/go/frog/menu.html<P>
This website is a step by step tutorial about dissecting a pithed frog (A pithed frog has his spinal cord, so it's techincally dead, but its organs are still functioning.  By starting with the "Introduction" button on the main menu, you can follow the dissection from pinning the frog to the pan to digging out its spleen and ending with a brief summary of how to dispose of the frog.  The tutorial is made up of descriptive steps accompanied by pictures.  The pictures aren't the greatest quality I've ever seen, but they show everything you would want to see (and anyway, if the quality wsa any better, it would've made me queasy.)  Many short movies are scattered throughout the tutorial showing a demonstration of most of the steps.  In addition, some of the movies show the frog's still-beating heart and expanding lungs.  I was particularly fascinated by the lungs; they blow up like balloons!<P>
The tutorial was extremely easy to follow.  All the steps were very descriptive, and the movies made every little incision very clear.  The pictures highlighted each organ being examined, and made identification easy.  Also, after each tutorial page, you can take a short quiz where you point out different organs and incisions yourself.<P>  
Overall, the page was a lot of fun.  I never had any troubles navigating through the site, and everything loaded quickly (even the movies loaded within fifteen seconds!).  I've dissected three fetal pigs through my educational career, but I've never seen a dissection where the organs were still working.  I found this very interesting in a morbid way.

This is the website of Dr. William H. Cliff, Dept. Biology, Niagara University, Niagara Univ., NY 14019, and 
includes a compilation of seven human anatomy and physiology case studies. <P>

This website has several objectives.  The first is to help students develop the necessary synthetic, analytical and diagnostic
thinking skills early in their program of study by introducing case analysis for various human organ system conditions.   Second,  
it should help deepen the student's understanding of the normal human anatomy and physiology, prove immediate, real- life 
relevance, and help develop an appreciation that the mastery of human anatomy and physiology is essential for achieving the 
clinical expertise of a competent health professional.  And third, to help students become truly knowledgeable by helping them 
to correctly apply the facts they have learned about the human body to the solution of relevant, real world problems.  <P>

This website did not necessarily contribute a significant amount of knowledge to my understanding of animal form and function, 
but it could be helpful for medical students who wish to sharpen their clinical diagnostic skills of human organ system conditions.  
This site appears to be relativley new as there are only seven case studies available to read at this time.  The site does have a 
system in place to recieve case studies submitted by other individuals in order to expand the available listings.  The site is very 
easy to use, as most of the pages are data only and no graphics.  I would recommend this site to any budding physicians wishing

This article which was written by Catherine W, Brittell M.D. is meant to let people know about the symptoms of Multiple sclerosis and that it can affect many different areas of ones life. Even though the effects are not totally curable they can be slowed by early detection. Dr. Brittell outlines major tests to determine which body functions are being affected and then offers means to treat them. She list not only skeletal muscle control, but also bladder and bowel control as well as sexual problems. Dr. Brittell illustrates that with early detection and proper treatment these problems can be slowed or rehabilitated back to normal. Although the degeneration of the muscle cells is the problem, the power of the mind is often key in healing.

While the section on structure and function is somewhat dry, it is labeled so that you can skim the section and find  the information you need quickly.
