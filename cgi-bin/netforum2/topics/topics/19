===more:     I read about tarantulas and their bites.  Tarantulas are responsible for .9% of all spider bites.  They inject venom with every bite.  Yet only 5% of people who are bitten have an allergic reaction.  This article discussed the precautions you should take to avoid spider bites, and what you should do if you get bitten.
     I was surprised that tarantulas weren't more deadly.  I was under the impression that all tarantula bites were harmful to humans, but they aren't.  This article was informative about how to treat a bite--so if I'm ever bitten now I'll know what to do!!
