===message:Bt-toxin is a protien produced by a soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).  The genes from Bt are inserted into corn hybrids (and other crops) which produce the Bt-toxin.  When the larvae of (specifically) the European Corn Borer (ECB) eats on a Bt-toxin corn plant, the Bt destroys their intestinal walls and causes them to die of hunger.<P>
There are many benefits to this technology and only about one disadvantage.  Comparing Bt to insecticides, coverage and timing of insecticides is not a problem since the toxin is already in the plant.  Bt is not a threat to the environment, animals, humans, and most other insects.  Many tests have proven there are no allergic reactions in humans and is environmentally safe.  Since the Bt corn plant is protecting itself from the European Corn Borer, yields are higher at harvest time.  Price of the Bt-toxin corn seed is expensive now, but is expected to go down as time goes on. The biggest problem with Bt is the resistance that is likely to happen with the European Corn Borer.  Plant geneticists are designing Bt corn to produce very high levels of Bt protiens to hopefully kill all ECB--ECB larvae with no genes for resistance plus those with one copy of a resistance gene.<P> 
I recommend this technology should be adopted and applied ONLY when scientist are sure they can kill the ECB.  I think now that it's already been used, ECB will be resistant in parts of the country, then eventually everywhere.  That is not for sure and we'll have to wait and see the results.  I think this technology is valuable for future advances.

The benefits of employing BT-toxin in agriculture are tremendous.  For one, since BT-toxin is a natural pesticide it can be used at no cost to the environment like other pesticides.  The cost of using Bt-toxin is that pest may become immune to the toxin.  If we used the transgenic plants widely we could have a situation like the great potato blight that wiped out nearly a whole countries crop.  Because of this I don't think that we should use the BT-toxin widely.

II.  I believe the costs of BT corn (for those who choose to use it) are worth the extra expense.  The benefits of the BT toxin are availability and insurance.  I learned a bit about BT corn and the corn borer during the summer of 1996. I worked for Northrup King and applied corn borer eggs to  BT corn.  (We applied them mixed in sand with giant syringes.)  I was informed that the BT toxin is naturally in the soil and had insecticide traits.  This makes it very readily accessed.  As for insurance, even though it may seem like a waste of money if the borers have a poor year, the expense will be made up for through the yield or previous or following years.  I have also heard that there may be problems with altering the genes and a bacterial resistence that is present.  Because of this new information, my suggestion is to limit the use of BT corn until more data can be collected and interpreted.  If it could cause harm to humans or animals, it would be terrible to find that out too late.  A given time should be allowed to continue testing it, and then a possible widespread use could take effect.

I must say that I am a bit hesistant about running out and planting millions of corn plants that have been genetically enginneered to produce a lethal protein.  In the above article, the author made an important point.  "Constant long-term exposure to pest populations to Bt encourages survival of individual pests that are genetically resistant to the toxin.  Over many generations, the proportion of resistant individuals in pest populations can increase..." (Report Calls..., 1998).  This natural adaptation to a new threat is why mankind will NEVER beat nature.  Our technology and ingenious is nothing compared to the simplest and most delicate ecosystem on this earth.  Therefore, any of the technological advances that we may make will simply be adapted to in short time.  The long term benefits of such work will probably be null.  However, I do think that man has had a profound effect in some areas of research and life.  It's just that, for every sucess, we have a thousand failures.  To conclude, I think that the introduction of Bt-producing crops is an interesting and important idea, but I'm not sure as to how wise it may be in the long run.<P><P>
In reply to Lori Applegate's message, I have to agree with her.  She identified numerous advantages without overlooking the one glaring disadvantage.  In her suggestion as to the application of Bt-crops, I also agree.  If there is a 100% chance (which is an oxymoron in nature) that pests will be wiped out or at least weakened by Bt, then I would say that Bt crops are suitable FOR THAT AREA.  However, since insects can travel wherever they wish, one month after planting, genetically resistant individuals could be the exception, not the norm.  Therefore, I still would be quite hesistant about introducing the new crops in my field.

===subject:Assignment 4, Part 2
===message:BT sprays have been used for around 40 years as an effective method of pest control.  It only seems natural that the next step in pest control would be to change the genetic makeup of the crops themselves.  Scientists accomplished this with BT corn.  BT corn has many advantages as well as disadvantages.<P>
The most obvious advantage is the controlling of the European Corn Borer (ECB).  There are also several less obvious advantages.  Because it's a natural pesticide, it has a much lower cost to the enviornment.  Farmers get bigger yields, and soil strain is decreased.  Although the seed costs more, farmers are able to save money because they don't have to put chemicals on the corn, and at the end of the season, they have a bigger yield resulting in more money for the farmer.<P>
But even with all these advantages, there are still several disadvantages.  By using the BT corn, it will eventually make the use of the BT spray non-effective, and with the BT spray's ability to kill ALL ECB (because they are not able to develop resistence that can be passed on to offspring), this is a very decided disadvantage.  This leads to the biggest disadvantage of the genetically engineered BT corn--the ECB is able to build up a resistence to the BT corn and subsequently pass that resistence on to future generations of ECB.  This trait would encourage the ECB that is resistent to the BT corn to survive, and after several generations, this population of resistent pests would be greater causing the BT corn to lose effectiveness.<P>
In order to counteract this effect, scientists say farmers would need to plant some non-BT corn as a haven for some of the ECB.  BT resistence has been found to be a recessive trait, and if we can maintain a population of non-resistent ECB to mate with the BT-resistent ECB, we will maintain future generations as non-resistent populations.  This haven would need to be close enough to the BT corn to ensure that the two populations (the resistent and the non-resistent) would be likely to breed and have non-resistent offspring, yet it needs to be far enough away that there are in fact two distinct populations.  If this were to happen, it would reduce the population of resistant ECB while maintaining many of the advantages of the BT corn.<P>
But, this raises another disadvantage.  History has shown that most farmers tend to do the most economically expedient thing of the moment (plant all BT corn) while ignoring the future disadvantages (BT-resistent ECB).  There will be a decided immediate cost disadvantage of planting two seperate crops--the BT corn, and the non-BT corn to function as a haven.  Becuase of this extra cost, fewer farmers are likely to want to do this, and in order for the BT corn to be successful, it is necessary for the farmers to take the responsibility on themselves.  If this haven is not established and maintained effectively, we will soon breed future generations of BT-resistent ECB.<P>
To me, the most important aspect is maintaining a low cost to the environment.  I believe that if there was a sure way to enforce all farmers to use BT corn "properly," then it would be a good, useful way to protect corn.  But, because there is no way to make sure all farmers will follow this plan and establish appropriate havens, I'm afraid we will see a future generation of BT-resistent ECB.  I think that we should just abandon the BT corn and allow the farmers who wish to use BT to continue using BT sprays which are proven effective without the disadvantage of develping resistent generations.<P>

===message:Last year a new type of plant was introduced into the commercial market place. A farmer couldn’t tell the difference from an standard corn plant and this new type of corn plant. He may have noticed ( if he planted the Bt-corn) that his yields were a little higher. On the average 40 million tons of corn around the world never make it to market simply because of a little bug called the European Corn Boar.  This new type of plant I've mentioned, Bt-corn, addresses this problem head on by simply killing the ECB. The Bt-toxin kills the ECB by Dissolving the intestinal wall of the ECB and causing the little bugs to die of starvation. So this solves the problem of the ECB in theory. unfortunately the issue is much more complex. Some would like to think that this new type of corn is a waste of money. That it is will only lead to resistant ECB in a few years. That the Bt toxin is harmful to humans. Some of these allegations may be true, but then again, we don’t really know. As to the problem of development of resistance, it is very important to realize that the Bt-toxin has been used in agriculture as a spray for half a century.  So if you ask me the ECB has had ample opportunity to display resistance. Now, I'm not saying the ECB will not eventually become resistant. I’m just saying it may take longer than three growing seasons as some have said.  I would recommend that the EPA keep a close watch on the Bt-corn and the ECB.  They have systems to keep resistance from happening and it would be a good idea for a watchful eye.  As for the Bt-toxin harming humans, I think this is a scary point. Once again I refer to the issue that the Bt-toxin has been used for half a century. Not only that but the levels of the Bt-toxin in plants is   20% lower than the spray used per acre.  The only attack i have yet to address is that of the value of Bt-corn. Well if corn prices stay as high as they have been in the last few seasons every bushel counts.  Farmers may very well pay a premium price in the beginning to reap greater rewards at harvest time. For every argument only time will tell, and the fact remains the Bt-corn is out there and people are using. I just hope that a constant vigilance is kept to make sure everything is working as planned.

http://www.nk.com/infosilo/news/btwhite.html<P>

Part 2<P>
Bacillus thuringiensis is a soil organism that produce toxins that kill many pests that threaten our plants.  The toxin is ingested by insect larave.  Inside the intestines, the crystalline toxin rips up and paralyzes the digestive tract.  Depending on the variety of insect and toxin used, death occurs between twelve hours to five days after ingestion.<P>
Scientists have succeeded in making corn plants with the gene that produces the Bt toxin.  These plants make their own pesticides and are far more resistant to insect attacks, especially from the European corn borer.  Tests have shown that even under low infestation levels (one or fewer borers per plant) the Bt corn outproduces normal corn by six bushels per acre.  Under higher infestation levels (more than three borers per plant), the benefits are even greater.  The Bt plants produce 19 bushels per acre more than normal corn plants.<P>
The Bt corn also has a higher resistance to disease.  This is because the corn borer pests usually eat holes in leaves which leaves (HA! I made a pun!)the plant more succeptible to fungal and disease infections.<P>
All these new advantages are great and ecologically sound, but (as usual) there is a serious draw back.  According to many articles (and a biochemistry professor I listened to once), the corn borers can develop resistance to the toxin in plants.  This could wipe out the whole Bt corn idea.  Not only would it render the transgenic plants useless, it would make the spray Bt pesticides less effective too.  I think this is an issue that scientists should proceed with with caution.  I believe that more testing needs to be done before anyone takes any big steps.

===message:It is difficult to answer the question of whether the Bt corn technology should be widely adopted without looking at the cost and benefit data, which I couldn’t find on the web. The following discussion is based on information compiled from various web sites dealing with pest control.
<P>
The general consensus appears to be that the Bt technology is very effective at controlling corn borer larvae, and no major side effects are reported or anticipated. There are therefore clear benefits to using Bt corn. However, we need to consider the cost side as well.
<P>
The first question is whether the use of Bt corn is appropriate as a pest management device in a given year. A computer model developed by David Onsted at the University of Illinois at Urbana (see the website referenced in Part 1 of this exercise) shows that in the years where ECB populations are not at economic levels, traditional hybrids outperform Bt corn. The "economic injury level" is the population density of the pest (e.g. ECB larvae per plant) at which the potential loss of crop yield economically justifies the cost of treatment (see Larry Pedigo’s paper at www.ent.agri.umn.edu/academics/classes/ipm/chapters/pedigo.htm for more information on this topic). Clearly, therefore, the judgment about the use of Bt corn in a given year depends on whether the projection population density of ECB larvae is high enough to justify the extra cost of Bt corn. 
<P>
Given that the decision to use Bt corn has been made in a given year, the next question is to ascertain the amount of corn to be used. Onsted’s computer model also shows that if 100% of the corn acreage was planted with Bt corn, the ECB larvae would develop resistance to the Bt toxin in one year ! Onsted’s recommendation is that no more than 80% of the acreage be planted with Bt corn, and that that 20% non Bt corn should always be planted in strips next to the Bt corn so that susceptible corn borers can survive and mate with resistant corn borers. The model indicates that this will increase the resistance to 20 years. So this appears to be a natural limit on the usage of Bt corn.
<P>
In summary, therefore, it seems that rather than using Bt corn as the only means of ECB control, a combination of approaches may be desirable. In any year, the choice whether to use Bt corn should be based on the forecast of the larval population density. This forecast value depends not only on genetics and ecology, but also on the intervention strategies adopted in the past - the forecasting model therefore needs to be a dynamic time series model that is updated every year with actual data. I don’t know if such a model exists for the ECB, but population models are common in biology, so I assume that one has been developed for the ECB as well.
<P>
A hybrid strategy  does not imply that we should use pesticides; an integrated pest management approach focusing on biological solutions is more desirable, since pesticides will invariably prove to be an expensive option if the cost of externalities (bad environmental effects) resulting from pesticide use is included in the cost calculation. A website at www.nysaes.cornell.edu describes the breeding of small stingless moths that act as parasites in ECB eggs - maybe this approach can be combined with Bt corn.

Farmers in the United States are attracted to such products by their high yields and low production costs while environmentalists are concerned that the genetically altered plants could cost consumers dearly down the road.  BT corn, for example, yields twenty bushels more per acre than traditional hybrids, not to mention the savings from not having to spray.  (Tobin, 1997).  Environmentalists are concerned that the use of BT corn could create new strains of ampicillin-resistant bacteria since the BT sequence contains a promoter for the ampicillin resistance gene which could be picked up by bacteria in animals’ and humans’ digestive tracts.  Furthermore, there is a concern that the widespread production of the crop will create a BT-resistant population of corn borers, and that the process of genetic manipulation may somehow decrease the nutritional value of the corn.  Europeans are upset that the U.S. is attempting to foist a new product upon them without providing an alternative since BT corn is not separated from traditional varieties in storehouses.

	My opinion on the subject is that BT corn production should be allowed if the farmer decides he can profitably market the corn domestically.  The economic advantages are certainly great, and by planting small plots of non-BT corn, the corn borer resistance problem could be combated.  Laboratory tests could be conducted to evaluate the ampicillin-resistance problem.

The toxin is alters three genes in corn, which makes it resistant to the bacillus thuringiensis. It is also used in cotton and soybeans.The reason it works is due to the fact that while it is harmless to humans, in high enough doses it kills pests. However, it is highly possible that through enough use we could see incidents similar to  introduction of DDT a few years ago. The insects became resistant to it and the concentration of this chemical climbed up the food chain. Because of this, other countires are wary to import this product and while some countries, like Canada, also produce it, the European Union refuses to accept this import. They fear that the BT-resistant corn borers will create a similar immunity in neighboring weeds.

===message:The use of corn seed hybrids containing the BT-toxin has many obvious short term advantages including less stress on the environment, lower costs to the farmer, (because of less pesticide use) and, most importantly, protection from many caterpillars (e.g. ECB), beetles (e.g. corn rootworm), and aquatic flies (e.g. black flies and mosquitos) that destroy millions of bushels of yield every year.  These advantages make hybrids with the BT-toxin very appealing to the farmer.<P>
With all of the benefits of BT-toxin hybrids, it seems almost too good to be true, and it partially is.  The biggest problem with widespread use of BT-toxin hybrids is the resistence that will soon be encountered.  It is widely believed that the ECB would very quickly develop a genetical resistence to the BT-toxin in the same way the Indian meal moth and the ECB in a lab have already done.  The ECB as a species has many advantages that would probably lead to its development of some type of resistence.  Every phase of the ECB life cycle involves corn, so the ECB has no escape.  Another advantage the ECB has is that as a moth it rarely flys over 2 miles away from its birth place.  This will encourage local development of resistence. Resistence will be sped up because the ECB produces multiple generations every summer.<P>
The resistence will be slowed some because the different seed companies will develop different BT-toxin hybrids and different toxins could be used together.<P>
The long term effectiveness of this type of pest treatment is certainly in question, but it does not make sense to have  this technology and not use it.  With the genetic engineering minds at the seed companies always running, some type of solution will be found.  Hopefully this solution will be found before widespread resistence to the BT-toxin is formed, which could take years.  BT-toxin hybrids should be used to the fullest.

Recent Research. Advances in biotechnology have produced improved prospects for developing new Bt
insecticides and an ability to place Bt toxins within crop plants in a variety of ways. For example, genes
directing the production of Bt toxins can be incorporated into certain plant-dwelling bacteria. When these
altered bacteria grow and multiply within an inoculated host plant, the Bt toxin is produced within the
plant. Genes coding the production of Bt toxins have also been inserted directly into the chromosomes of
certain crop plants. Although the development of this technology may seem ideal, the season-long,
high-level control it can provide will also pose a great risk for the development of insect resistance to the
Bt toxin. Bt products have been used successfully for many years, but resistance in field or laboratory
populations of the diamondback moth, Indian meal moth, Colorado potato beetle, and tobacco budworm
has been reported. One mechanism for resistance is the reduced binding of the Bt toxin to the midgut
receptor sites. As genes for production of insecticidal compounds are added to crop plants, developers
must devise methods of preventing or managing insecticide resistance in target pests. Current plans to
develop and use "Bt-corn", "Bt-potatoes", and other crops that produce Bt toxins are progressing much
more rapidly than plans and actions designed to manage resistance in target pests. <P>

Obviously, we do not know all of the costs of using Bt-toxin containing corn.  It is likely that the european

payers will have to pay dearly for.  It is possible that the Bt-toxin containing gene could be cross-bred into 
other plant species, creating problems that one can only imagine.  Another cost to the farmer is the premium 
price which he will have to pay for this new technology. <P>

Benefits of using the Bt-toxin containing corn could include: monetary profit for the seed and bio-technology 
companies; reduced quantities of other more harmful insecticides being introduced into the environment and 
possible short term monetary gains for farmers. <P>

It appears to me that if you look only at the equation of planting Bt-toxin containing corn vs. planting regular 
corn and applying the necessary quantities of insecticides that there may be a short term benefit to using the 
Bt-toxin containing corn.  Wouldn't it be nice if it were so simple.  Please, it is not that simple.  As the article 
above states: "current plans to develop and use "Bt-corn", "Bt-potatoes", and other crops that produce Bt 
toxins are progressing much more rapidly than plans and actions designed to manage resistance in target 
pests" or, how to address other unforeseen side effects.  I highly recommend that this technology should not 
be widely adopted.

===message:In the BT-toxin treatment I see immediate short term advantages for individual farmers. After all, who in their right mind would not want to grow all of the corn they possibly could for their money. However, looking through a wider viewpoint we can look at the overall less money for their corn. The lower amounts of money received by farmers for their corn could result from a flood of excess grain in the markets. This often happens in todays market with just a good growing season, the supply exceeds the demand. In the future with a growing world population we may need to utilize this and all other genetic engineering tools to produce as much grain as possible. Now is not the time in my opinion, the market could not stand it.
Another important point to consider would be the resistance  the corn bores could acquire to resist the BT-Toxin, many other times we have come up with pesticides which work against insects but very rarely does a resistant population not soon follow.
Other important issues are social one

===message:The short term advantages of Bt corn (such as lowered costs and insect protection) seem wonderful, but on the same note we need to remember the long term disadvantages.  Widespread use could lead to resistance, which in turn would cost the farmers more to keep the EBC away.  Many are saying that we should plant both Bt and non Bt corn.  In doing so, we are giving the EBC a chance to develop in both circumstances.  In doing this, we are preventing widespread resistance.  As a society, we have a tendendcy to do the most cost efficient thing and put the long term disadvantages in the back of our minds.  While planting both Bt and non Bt corn may not be as immediately cost effective, the long term savings could be substantial.

I agree totally with Dallas Crowley.  Though we have the tendency to think on a short term level only, it would only be to our benefit if we thought on a more long term scale.

===message:The natural BT pesticide produced by bacteria  sounds like a dream come true for farmers producing herbs and vegetables universally.  It has been widely used on an abundance of organic herbs and vegetables, and particularly corn, targeting a small amount of insects at a time, breaking down easliy and swiftly, and is harmless to people and animals.

However, the down side to this apparently "ideal" pesticide is that when overused, like many treatments, insects can develop a resistance, making the Bt toxin obsolete in many cases.  Within the last 10 years, more and more of these resistant insects are developing, and today there are over 500 insects having evolved a built-in protection against the toxin. It appears that the current debate is whether farmers should be required to follow techniques that would lower the resistance risk. Farmers would need to make a commitment to use the new techniques wisely and meticulously to achieve results, a task that  some farmers may not be willing to untake.  

The answer seems logical;that using the transgenic plants as a solution to the farmers growing toxin resistant problem will almost assuredly capture the best of both worlds because the new transgenic plants will work for themselves.  The fact remains, however, that insect resistance to the transgenic corn plants is inevitable.  Therefore, the farmers are once again at square one, being boxed into a corner of using newer techiniques for anti-resistance.  I think that farmers have no choice but to be prudent, continuing to employ the transgenic plants they are ready to implement the newer resistance lowering techniques, and then rotate cropland keep areas where nonresistant insects will mate with resistant ones to keep resistance from spreading too quickly.

===message:Have we learned anything from the pesticides of the past?  The BT-toxin provides us with a great oppurtunity to learn from our past mistakes.  We once used DDT as a pestcide, but this toxin has little or no effect on the instects of today.   By abusing the use of a toxin, the insects with a tolerance to the pesticide will survive.  These insects will survive, reproduce, and pass the gene onto the offspring.  We did that to DDT and we are doing it to the BT-toxin.  Now how can we prevent this from happening? It is quite mix sections of BT-toxin treated seeds into non-treated.  By alternating every few rows, The population of the corn bores  will diminshes, but still leaving the weak gene in th gene pool.  This will not allow the bores to build a tolerance and we are all happy.

===message:Researches have genetically modified corn so that it produces the protein of a soilbacterium in its leaves stalk and pollen.  This protein is called “Bt-toxin” and is producedby Bacillus thuringiensis.  This helps the plant to protect itself from the European cornborer.<p>There are some benefits to this new technology, but these benefits may not be long lasting. Developers of Bt-toxin have admitted that the use of these plants may hasten the evolutionof Bt-toxin resistant insects.  This new technology may be beneficial in the short term, butits use may hinder crops in the long run.  Bt-toxin has been used externally as a naturalpesticide for many crops.  If the use of Bt-toxin containing plants hastens the resistance ofinsects this will cause a problem for these growers, and we may find that we need toreturn to pesticides that are not as environmentally friendly.  I believe before thistechnology is widely used that there should be more extensive research to prevent thisresistance.<p>Reply to Bt corn part 2 by Lori Applegate<p>I agree that because Bt-toxin has been already used ECB will eventually be resistant inparts of the country, and eventually everywhere.  I also feel that this technology shouldhave only been applied when scientists were sure that they could prevent this.  Because ofthe use that has already occurred there will some day be resistant ECB.<p>

Part 2:  Incecticides are very controversial these days because of concerns about food safety, groundwater contamincation and thier effect on other forms of life living in the same environment as the organism they are designed to kill.  BT-toxin containing corn has several benefits when a comparison is made to traditional insecticides.  Because is naturally found in the soil and produces endotoxins specific to lepidopteran larvae it causes few detrimental effects on non-target organism.  With the use of BT-toxin there would be a decrease in the use of the pesticides that contaminate food and water as well as the animals that eat them.  Some of the          diadvantages of using BT-toxin is that the larvae may become resistant to it if it put into widespread use.  Insects that have become resistant will grow out of control and produce major crop damage in the future.  A further problem of resistance developing is it may be difficult to find another solution to killing the insect.  The actual cost of the BT-toxin may also cause a problem.  This is an expensive technique to put into widespread use although the crop that results may more that pay for the BT-toxin.  <P>
It is very difficult to determine what the future holds.  My recommendation is to use BT_toxin sparingly in places where the larvae are a major problem.  Otherwise I think that it would be wise to conduct further testing to see how fast these insects do become resistant to BT-toxin in a contolled laboratory environment to help prevent an infestation in the future.
