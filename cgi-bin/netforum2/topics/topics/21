===more:Corla reefs are the most diverse and reproductive groups on earth.  Their habitat is in warm, clean, shallow waters of world wide tropic oceans. Reef-building corals are of the order Scleractinia in the class Anthozoa of the Phylum Cnidaria.  Some coral colonies contain thousands of polyps.  
Many problems of coral reefs are human caused.  Fortunately, they can be remedied due to the fulfilled communities and the mass reproduction of coral reefs.
