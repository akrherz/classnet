===message:Hi.  My name is Dallas Crowley.  (I know.  Most people with the name Dallas are guys, but I'm an exception.)  I'm a sophomore in high school and would very much like to be a biologist.  Right now, my main interest is is marine biology with an emphasis on the cognitive intelligence of cetaceans.  However, after my first biology course, I find that I'm also interested in genetics.  I am on the school's varsity Drill Team (we placed third at state!), was manager of the volleyball team, and I' currently inolved in large group speech (reader's theater).  I'm the oldest of two kids (my little brother is only two).  As to what I hope to gain from this course, I mostly hope to gain a strong foundation for future courses in biology.

===message:I'm Eric Underbakke.  I'm a freshman at Iowa State University.  I'm an Agricultural Biochemistry major.  I like almost anything to do with science (Not geology though, sorry), and I assumed that biology classes were a must for any serious biochemist.  My hobbies are fairly dull.  I read too much, and I adore movies.  I am also fond of guinea pig maintenance.  Apparently, I am also fond of starting sentences with the word "I."  I guess I like writing a lot, but that's just a fetish, of sorts.

===message:<P>Hi, my name is Tom Ingebritsen. I will be your instructor for the
first part of this course (Units 1 & 2). I am also the Course
Director which means you should contact me regarding any
administrative problems that you might have.</P>

<P>A bit about my background. I grew up in Oregon and received a
Bachelors Degree from Oregon State University in 1968. My major was
Chemistry. I then moved to Indianapolis, Indiana where I worked for a
drug company, Eli Lilly, for ten years. I was in their
Atherosclerosis drug development program where I did research on
cholesterol metabolism. During that period I was also working on my
Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the Indiana University School of Medicine
also in Indianapolis. I completed that degree in 1979. I then went to
Scotland where I spent three years at the University of Dundee on a
Postdoctoral Fellowship. In 1982 I returned to the United States and
took a faculty position in the Department of Pharmacology at the
University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. Where by the way
I became a life long Bronco's fan. GO BRONCOS IN SUPER BOWL XXXII!!</P>

<P>I have been at Iowa State University since 1986 where I am
currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Zoology and
Genetics. My major area of interest is distance education and
outreach to biology educators. In addition to this course, I teach
another on-line course Gen 308/508 (Biotechnology in Agriculture,
Food and Human Health). I am director of a program called Project
BIO. This is an outreach program with the broad vision of developing
and sharing biology education resources via the internet. It is a
multidisciplinary program involving seven departments and programs at
Iowa State. It is also a partnership of biology educators at Iowa
State University, Iowa Community Colleges and Iowa high schools.
Assisting faculty in the development of on-line biology courses is
currently the major area of emphasis in the Project BIO program.</P>

<P>On a personal level, I am married. My wife, Denise and I have a
four year old son, Isaac, who we adopted from Russia in December,
1996. He keeps us very busy! I also have two older children, Eric and
Tracy, from a previous marriage. Tracy is attending the University of
Florida and Eric works for an investment company in St. Petersburg,
Florida. My wife and I are active in our church, we enjoy eating out,
going to movies, playing cards and entertaining friends.</P>

<P>I look forward to participating in this course with you.</P>

===message:Hi All!  My name is Jim Colbert, and I will be the instructor for Units 3 and 4 of this course (Plant Structure and Function).  Let me tell you a little bit about myself: <br>
<br>


	I am a native Iowan - I grew up in Cedar Rapids.  I received my BS in Biology from Iowa State in 1978 (the same year the wheel was invented).  I earned my MS (1981) and PhD (1985) degrees from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  I then spent 3 years as an Assistant Professor at Colorado State University in their Department of Botany (I'm pulling for the Broncos too...... but I'm not really a big football fan).  In 1988 I returned to Iowa State and joined the Department of Botany here.  I am currently an Associate Professor.  I teach Bio 202 (in *real time* as well), non-majors Botany, and a graduate course in Plant Molecular Biology.  My area of research interest is root-preferential genes in maize and soybeans. <br>
<br>


	I'm married and have two great kids - a son (15) and a daughter (12).  My wife also teaches at Iowa State.  I also have a dog - a yellow lab that we call "Sundog" (sometimes she even comes when we call!!!).  My interests include numerous types of outdoor activities:  hiking, cross-country skiing, canoeing, winter camping, fishing (especially smallmouth bass), pheasant chasing (I'd call it "hunting", but my dog and I invite relatively few of them home to dinner), and morel mushroom hunting. I like a wide range of music, movies, and reading the occasional sci-fi novel.  I also spend alot of time watching my kids play sports (baseball, basketball, and softball). <br>

	And YES - the picture on the course home page really is me....... but my hair isn't always so wild.  That picture was taken in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area a couple of years ago at the end of a winter camping trip.  If you've ever wondered what your hair would look like if you didn't take your stocking cap off for 10 days in a row - now you know.

I was 1st Team All-State Class 1A quarterback in football, and my team went 7-2.  My junior year we were 9-2 and advanced to the state play-off quarter-finals.  
Sports are a passion for me.  When I'm not participating, I can  usually be found watching or reading about sports.  I love most all outdoor activities, especially golf.  
After high school I am undecided on where I am going to college.  I have it narrowed down to a few choices, but I'm clueless after that.  I may play football, but that would be second to acedemics.  I am planning on entering the medical field.  I have spent many hours at my local hospital and even a few in the ER at Iowa Methodist.  Medicine is definately in my future.

===message:I’m David Vleck, and I am one of the three ISU faculty members responsible for teaching Biology 202 on the Web. I’ll give the lectures on animal structure and function.

My interests in biology center around physiological ecology  and comparative physiology. I like to find out how animals’ physiology, morphology and behavior enable them to exploit the enormous diversity of environments in the biosphere.  I’m interested in the differences between animals, their adaptive significance, and their evolutionary origins. I’ve studied animals ranging from sphinx moths to burrowing rodents to lizards, penguins and ostrich eggs. I’m interested in how animals use resources, especially water and energy, and how the availability of those resources constrains the things those animals can do. One advantage of studying animals from unusual environments is that you have to go to unusual places to do it. Biology has taken me to Australia, Panama and Costa Rica, the Galapagos Islands, and Antarctica, as well as lots of places around the US. Africa is next on the list.

I moved to ISU about 1993. Prior to that I was at the University of Arizona, so a lot of the animals I’ve studied and the biological examples I use to illustrate concepts are from desert environments. When I was an undergraduate, I  went to Pomona College in California, then got a Ph.D. at UCLA. I did postdoctoral work in Seattle, New York and Adelaide, Australia. At ISU I teach in courses in physiology and environmental physiology, and participate in seminars on animal physiology and the evolutionary biology of organisms and populations, as well as doing Biology 202.

I graduated ten years ago with a Ph.D in Civil Engineering, and since then have done a mixture of things - some university teaching, several years of research and now my consulting work. The reason I'm taking this course is that while I'm well trained in Physics and Chemistry, I have no training in biology, and I've become interested in the field - also, I'm contemplating pursuing a medical degree, and this course will hopefully be a good pre-requisite. My work requires me to be on the road a lot, and so I'm hoping that the web format will allow me to keep up wherever I am - though the technical challenges of accessing the web from hotel rooms abroad will no doubt be daunting ! I've a lot of hobbies I have very little time for, but mostly I read and listen to music - classical and jazz, and now that I'm enrolled in this course, I'll probably not have time for these either !

===message:    Where I'm from is a difficult one....My father was in the Marines and we moved around a lot. If I had to narrow it down I would say Southern California and Yuma, Arizona. Both of my parents are from the Quad City area, and with the failing health of my grandparents, I decided to move back here to be with them. Unfortunately, my studies have suffered because of our relationship, however I do not regret neglecting my studies in favor of time with them because they were and always will be the greatest friends and all around good people I have ever known.
    Hobbies wound be reading and art. Which is appropriate seeing as I am a BPMI (Biological/Pre-Medical Illustration) major.
