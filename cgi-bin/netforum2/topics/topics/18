     The classs Hirudinea differs from the other annelids in many ways.  They have a set number of segments (usually 34), 
they have a dorsal-ventrally flattened body, and in most species they have both anterior and posterior suckers.  
     The class hirudinea is more commonly called leeches.  There are approximately 500 different species of the class hirudinea.  They are hermaphroditic and they live in moist, warm conditions.  Most leeches live in freshwater, although others live in marine environments, and still others live on land.  Another trait common in the class hirudinea is that most are either carnivorous or parasitic. Physicians also study the anticoagulant that they secrete as they feed.
