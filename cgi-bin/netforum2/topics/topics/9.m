===message:It's my understanding that plants in general will prosper due to the effects of global warming.  Higher carbon dioxide concentrations result in higher respiration (and therefore production).  However, green plants respire water vapor as well as oxygen.  Water vapor is the most abundant green house gas in the atmosphere.  So, while the plants prosper in a high CO2 environment they're doing so at the expense of long wave radiation out, that is, it will be reflected back to earth, increasing global warming.  <P>
While CO2 is in the atmosphere at high levels, I think perhaps methane emissions are of greater worth as far as reduction.  Methane is up to 20 times, molecule for molecule, more potent at absorbing radiation than is CO2, and it's also the most rapidly increasing green house gas. 
I thnk we should invest technology in areas like agriculture or lanfill management to try and siphon the methane emissions and use them for fuel.   Yes this adds CO2 to the atmosphere, but remember CO2 is 20 times less absorptive than methane.<P>

Researchers have pointed the blame at the  elimination of trees, particularly tropical rain forests, and the burning of fossil fuels.  Trees absorb and recycle carbon dioxide.  Without them, we have an abundance of carbon dioxide which could have a very drastic effect on our earth in the future.  When radiation from the sun hits earth, it is reflected back into space.  Carbon dioxide and water vapor in the atmosphere take in this reflected radiation and aim it back towards earth.  This is called the greenhouse effect, and it creates warmer temperatures on earth.     I think that the best thing we can do to prevent global warming is to plant trees, and to reduce deforestation.  With trees we could eliminate the abundance of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere because the trees would absorb more and recycle it.  We could also be more concious about how we use fossil fuels, especially coal. There should be regulations on how plants and factories can emit dangerous gases into our atmosphere, creating global warming.

For starters when you plant new trees try to position them so that they will eventually help protect the house from the sun during the summer so that the energy needed to fuel buildings is reduced.  Buy items that have minimal packaging.  This can save energy in the manufacturing process as well as save trees needed to absorb C02.  You can also buy recycled items, so that fewer new trees are cut down, and recycle stuff, so that there will be more recycled items to buy in the future.  And then there is always the possibility of riding your bike, walking, or carpooling whenever it is an option.<P>

here's my statement:  according to multiple sources, namely the website above, plants do not contribute to global warming (trapping of greenhouse gases), but they do help to elimate some of these potentially dangerous compounds.  why do i say potentially?  well, to be honest, many scientists are not yet certain that global warming is bad, but all do say that global warming will have SOME effect on the biosphere.  Water levels may rise, temperature may increase, habitats may be altered...but these aren't necessarily bad things.  global warming could be just another part of nature's cycle.  We've had multiple ice ages, and just as many hot flashes as well.  The earth is a resilient body, capable of sustaining a direct hit by a meteorite six MILES in diameter.  That's probably what killed the dinosaurs.  But, even after a catastrophe such as that, the earth survived.  so, all i'm saying is that global warming may signal the end or at least the submission of mankind, but, to the earth, it's like breaking a light sweat, with about the same consequences.<P>
so, before we all run out and buy electric cars (which will pollute almost as much because of the electrical power (read: COAL) needed to power them), think about the BIG picture.  if the earth is gonna heat up, there's nothing we can do about it.  it's nature's way, so we might as well have fun and not worry so much.  i'm not saying that we should burn gas and oil for the fun of it, but we needn't make such fuss over the little things, just try to fix some of the big things.<P><P>
here's my recommendations for reducing greenhouse gases:  make everyone walk.  seriously, the development of efficient mass-transit systems that are non-polluting would be a major help, especially in cities already plauged with smog and other nasties.  BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) is one of the leading models for an efficient way of getting around San Francisco.  If the 500 largest cities in the world did away with cars, that would help tremendously in keeping emissions down.  also, stricter pollution controls in industry, along with conservation of forests, replanting of stripped areas, and other such measures would decrease greenhouse gas production immensely.  But, if we REALLY wanna limit CO2 production, we have to kill all the termites out there.  Did you know that termites produce TEN times as much CO2 as humans do?  yep, those little buggers are not only ripping apart houses, but they're also killing us.  i say we fumigate the whole planet.  that'll fix things.<P><P>
my response:  i'm replying to Jonathan Mullin's message.  I think he's right, especially about punishing those who violate environmental protection laws.  i know that i said before how we shouldn't care all that much, but industry is one of the main contributors of poisonous gases and other wastes into the environment.  sure, screw greenhouse gases for a second and think about what would happen when all the birds have three wings???  that'll change thanksgiving dinner, for one.  not only does industry spew CO2 out, but lots of other gases that are MUCH more deadly and dangerous.  carcinogens, neurotoxins...you name it, they cough it out of those damn smokestacks.  or they simply let it run into streams and rivers, killing trees, fish, and other wildlife (but thankfully, those pesky termites, too).  however, the tradeoff isn't that great.  what's a couple million termites to a herd of deer or a....what's a herd of fish called?...or a grove of trees?  i'm not so sure that plain old CO2 is the problem, but all the other junk that's released IS.  so, those laws we have in place, they're there for a reason.  example: DDT.  why are so many species of birds endangered?  DDT.  even posessing a can of the stuff is illegal.  there's a reason for those laws, and when they're not obeyed, bad things happen.

<P>
The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon by which the greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, ozone and nitrous oxide) in the earth’s atmosphere prevent all the solar radiation that the earth receives from being radiated back to space. This keeps the earth’s average annual surface air temperature at about 15 degrees Celsius. Without the greenhouse effect, the earth would be 33 degrees Celsius colder on the average, and would be uninhabitable. 
<P>
In the past 10 years, prominent scientists have contended that in recent times, the greenhouse effect is contributing to an increase in temperature of the earth’s surface, because of the increased emissions of greenhouse gases (especially carbon dioxide) caused by human activities. This increase in temperature is referred to as "global warming". It is predicted, albeit with considerable controversy, that global warming will result in significant climatic and ecological changes in the next 50-100 years, that will significantly affect future life on earth.
<P>
Three  human activities are identified in the literature as major contributors to global warming: burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and the oxidation of soil litter and humus. Each of these activities involves plants in direct and indirect ways. The burning of fossil fuels contributes to the augmentation of greenhouse gases since their combustion yields carbon dioxide and other gases such as nitrous and nitric oxides and sulfur dioxide. Fossil fuels originated as plants, and therefore plants are indirectly involved in the increase in greenhouse gases occurring from this source.
<P>
Deforestation impacts greenhouse gases in two ways. First, when forests are cleared for agricultural purposes, primary and secondary vegetation is burnt, which directly releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Second, plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen during respiration, and deforestation reduces the opportunity for this absorption. Studies show (Adger and Brown, 1994) that the conversion of primary growth forest to permanent agriculture results in a loss of 220 tonnes (British) of carbon for every hectare of deforestation. Clearly, in this case, plants directly affect the amount of grrenhouse gases
<P>
Finally, carbon is trapped in the soil by the biomass present there. Inefficient agricultural practices that result in the erosion of topsoil cause the biomass to decay and the carbon to be oxidized into carbon dioxide. This is the third method by which plants influence the amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
<P>
A simple, inexpensive and workable method for reducing the effects of global warming does not exist; if it did, it would have been adopted by now, and we would have been spared the extended controversy. There seems to be less and less argument among scientists about the existence of global warming - the primary debate now is about its extent, and the impact that it will have on the climate of the future. The debate therefore is between the "avoiders" and the "adapters". The avoiders are those who see the future consequences of global warming to be so serious that they feel that steps, however expensive, must be taken immediately. The adapters reason that the overall impact is not likely to be very serious, and even if it is, is unlikely to occur for another 5-10 decades, by which time it will be possible to adapt to its effects. The solution proposed therefore depends on which camp a person belongs to, which is less influenced by scientific factors than by a person’s political and social beliefs.
<P>
Belonging by temperament to the avoider’s camp, and being of the belief that uncontrolled pollution and deforestation are not natural consequences of economic progress, but are displays of aggressive extravagance, my solution is going to lean towards encouraging reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. But also being practical, I believe that any attempt to control emissions by international law will not be enforceable without significant costs. Therefore, though imperfect and still very hard to implement, I favor a market solution (see, for example, Wiener, 1997) where countries are given an economic incentive to reduce greenhouse gas emission. This approach is already being used in the U.S. to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions in factories. Under this approach, countries that do not have a cost-effective emission reduction technology can buy "emission allowance" from countries that do. The allocation of the allowances would need to be carefully determined and might be dependent on historical emission patterns. The allocation would be administered through international treaty with options for reallocation to ease any distortions. In the short run, there would be an incentive for rich countries to participate, since in the short run, they can purchase emission allowances without the immediate need for expensive emission reduction technologies, while poorer countries can gain revenue from the sale of the allowances. In the longer run, it stimulates countries to think of creative options to reduce emissions. Monitoring and enforcement would be similar to those required under any international treaty.

The Global Warming International Center (GWIC) is the international body disseminating information on global warming science and policy, serving both governamental, non-governamental organizations, and industries in more than 120 countries. It sponsors unbiased research supporting the understanding of global warming and its mitigation. <P>
 

Part 2:<P>
First of all, my understanding is that plants converted the high concentrations of carbon dioxide of the early earth to organic compounds.  This happened most notably during the Carboniferous Period of the Paleozoic Era, but, aside from times of catastophies such as huge volcanic activity, the carbon dioxide levels have generally decreased in the earth's atmosphere until the dawn of the industrial revolution which began about 150 years ago.  Again, this reduction in carbon dioxide was due to a net conversion of carbon dioxide to organic matter primarily via the process of photosythesis of plants.  The in last 150 years, humans have been converting huge quantities of organic compounds, mainly in the form of petroleum and coal, back into carbon 
dioxide thus increasing the atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide.  <P>

So, plants are an indirect cause of increased levels of greenhouse gases because humans are burning the organic compounds which the plants converted via the photosythesis process, however plants are directly involved in the reduction of greenhouse gases by converting carbon dioxide into organic compounds, thus reducing atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases.  <P>


Part 3: <P>
First of all, I can not think of any way that humans can have a direct effect in minimizing the impact of greenhouse gas induced global warming.  I haven't even heard of any capacity to minimize the effect of this years el-nino, other than to forcast inclimate weather and recommend for people to take necessary precautions.  I assume that this question wants me to address what steps we can take to reduce the greenhouse gases which are causing and will continue to cause global warming.  If this is the question, my recommendation is for governments to begin to tax fossil fuel energy at taxation levels considerably higher than what they currently are.  This would do several things:<P>
1. It would reduce the consumption of fossil fuels just because they are more expensive;<P>
2. It would make renewable energy, (preferably solar energy and hydro-electric energy) more affordable than fossil fuel 
energy, therefore increasing its use;<P>
3. It would generate tax revenues which could be spent on: <P>

Part 2
<br>
My understanding of global warming is that it is caused by depletion of the ozone layer.  CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) were said to hover in the atmosphere, since they are insoluble in water, and eventually creep up into the stratosphere.  While present in the stratosphere, these substances, included in Freon, are mixed with high-energy radiation.  This causes chlorine atoms to become free.  The atoms readily mix with ozone to form ClO and O2 gases.  Plants produce O2, so this is where the relationship between plants and global warming comes into effect.  Since ozone depletion rate increases as chlorine increases, this is thought to produce the holes in the ozone.  This would cause global warming because ozone is a very important protective layer around the earth.  It keeps dangerous ultraviolet rays from reaching the earth.  Some of the harmful rays penetrate, but ozone provides a great deal of protection.
<p>
The web site I found stated that CFCs found in the Freon that is present in air conditioners, refrigerators, and aerosol spray cans doesn't affect the ozone much, if at all.  It was stated that termites release gases just as harmful to the atmosphere as these Freon-containing products.  Since time began, humans have not created nearly enough pollutants to cause any noticible damage.  I don't know if I agree with this or not, because of the global warming taking place.  CO2 gathering in the atmosphere cannot be used up fast enough, so it is at higher levels than before the Industrial Revolution.  This carbon dioxide traps the heat from the earth, causing the global warming.  It acts like the glass walls of a greenhouse.
<br>
Part 3
<br>
If this is possible in any way, we should increase the number of CO2 absorbing organisms, plants, on earth.  
Population explosions are a problem, but there are areas of land that aren't totally necessary to clear away.  We could even increase the number of potted plants and cover the city streets and blocks with.  I really don't know any other creative or logical ways to correct this problem.

===message:As I understand it, global warming occurs when "greenhouse gases" (carbon dioxide, mostly) are in overabundance in the atmosphere.  Normally the sun shines its radiation down on earth, and some of it is reflected.  The rest of the radiation warms the earth (except Iowa), and is reflected back into space also.  When greenhouse gases are in excess in the atmosphere, after the radiation warms and bounces off the earth, CO2 (and cohorts) absorb the radiation and re-emit it in all directions, including back at the earth.  This radiation that bounces from the sun to the earth, off the earth's atmosphere, and back at the earth again, causes too much heat.  The whole process works on the same concept as a plant greenhouse.<P>
This, in itself, is not bad for the earth.  The earth has gotten hot before, and it will again.  The problem arises when there are little monkey men (i.e. humans)  who speed the process up with cars and industry.  The earth will survive the whole ordeal, no matter how badly humans pollute the air.  Life on this planet (humans included) may not survive it, however.  It's not a pretty senario.  Environmentalist groups have been doomsaying about melting ice caps, California sinking under the waves (would that really be so bad?), increase in tropical diseases, and air conditioning bills that could make a grown man cry.  All these things could happen if the world (actually, the US is probably the biggest culprit), doesn't clean up its "greenhouse gas" emissions.

Personally, I think the answer to global warming (and many other environmental/energy crisis woes) is to figure out cold fusion.  We'd have no shortage of energy, and no harmful pollutants.  This may be a pipedream, but current answers just aren't good enough.  Energy plants running off biomass fuels may solve an oil shortage problem, but they still produce greenhouse gases.  Windmills and solar energy still seem to be an unrealistic solution.  We can't use either till we figure out how to control the weather.  Nuclear energy (the excessively warm fission kind) doesn't pour out greenhouse gases, but it does create scary radioactive byproducts.  I truly believe that we'll have that mythical, renewable power source someday.  And if we don't, we may have to seriously cut back on our power usage.  And no one is going to want to do that.

I truly believe that the only way anything is going to get done about this problem is to remain aware of it. Those of us in this course right now are the biologists, botanists, engineers, researchers, scientists and leaders that are going to sculpt the future of the planet. We can delude ourselves and say that global warming isn't a problem and let it slip our minds, OR, we can commit to the ecosystem being a priority in what we do. We can help raise community awareness. We can plant trees and sponser organizations to do the same. We can make it our life's work to study the problem and find the solution. We can support environmental causes that help implement that solution. We can engineer cleaner burning fuels and explore alternative energy sources. <P>

===message:	The atmosphere surrounding the earth not only serves to support life chemically but also acts as an insulating blanket which keeps the sun’s heat in the ecosystem.  The earth is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the sun; i.e., the earth radiates energy back into space at the same rate it absorbs energy from the sun.  As seen from space, the earth has a temperature of 254 K outside the atmosphere (about –2.5 degrees F), a temperature much too cold to sustain life. Through a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect, the atmosphere retains a great deal of the sun’s energy which would otherwise radiate back into space.  Water vapor and carbon dioxide are the atmospheric components responsible for infrared absorption.  (Brown, 1994) <P>
	As humanity alters the natural carbon dioxide balance through its diverse machinations, the temperature of the earth may rise a few degrees over the next century.  Since plants rely on carbon dioxide to produce photosynthesis, they are intrinsically affected by the changing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  Indeed, as the levels of carbon dioxide rise, plant growth actually increases, particularly plants with a C3 Calvin cycle since these plants are more affected by carbon dioxide availability.   Due to this selection, the dominance of C3 plants may increase as the carbon dioxide levels increase.  (Campbell, 1996) <P>
	As more and more areas of forestation are being destroyed, the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rise since a great amount of carbon dioxide is converted to glucose through photosynthesis.  It is estimated that each year, 20% of the carbon dioxide emission due to humanity is caused by the annual destruction of 25 million acres of rain forest.  (Helikson, 1992)  Plants are the regulators of the carbon dioxide cycle, and it is to plants that humanity should turn as it seeks the answer to this dilemma that has the potential to drastically alter life as we know it.

===message:The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon where greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, ozone, etc.) prevent the solar radiation from being radiated back into space.  This is called global warming.  Some global warming is necessary in order to keep the earth's temperature at a level where the planet remains habitable.
<br>
The increased production and emission by humans of carbon dioxide have contributed to the overall rise in global temperature.  The burning of fossil fuels is the primary way that humans increase CO2 production.  Fossil fuels were originally plants-therefore plants are indirectly involved in the increase in greenhouse gases.
<br>
Deforestation is a key issue in global warming.  Most deforestation is done by burning, causing a direct release of CO2 into the atmosphere.  Plants, which normally use CO2 and release O2, are being killed. So by simply burning trees, we are not only increasing the CO2 levels from the fire, but we are increasing levels because of decreased photosynthesis.
<br>
There is no cheap way to solve the global warming problem.  Yes, we can control emissions and fine for deforestation, but these things take money.  Our government, and the other governments of the world, want to save us from the harms and dangers of global warming, but they are not willing to do the work it takes to achieve this.  We as individuals need to do what we can, but we need to make it a global effort.  Yes, planting trees and making stricter regulations, as suggested by Sarra Nachtman and Jonathan Mullin, are wonderful ideas, but we as a culture and human race need to decide whether we want to slowly kill our planet and selves, or if we want to take action and make a difference.

===message:There is a natural greenhouse effect that keeps the earth habitable, but man is disrupting the precarious balance of this natural greenhouse effect.  Greenhouse gases are made up of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and chloroflorocarbons (CFC's).  Once emitted these gases can stay in the atmosphere decades or centuries before being absorbed or broken down.  The main source of emissions of CO2 is the burning of fossil fuels.  Thirty-five percent of these emissions come from the use of household utilities, thirty-one percent come from transportation, and twenty-one percent come from various industries.  With all these unnecessary CO2 emissions the earth's environment is changing at a much faster rate than normal.<P>
Plants are especially effected by these changes.  During the process of photosynthesis plants use CO2 and sunlight to produce energy and nutrients for their cells.  Theoretically, because of this use of CO2, plants should be flourishing with the amplified greenhouse effect.  Theoretically.  But there are many side effects of global warming that harm plants.<P>
Because of the fast changes occuring in the environment plants are unable to adapt well, and therefor several species of plants may become extinct.  There is also the fact that the higher average temperatures will cause a raise in evaporation resulting in dry soil and drought.  Those factors will make it harder for young plants, that don't have well established root systems, to survive.  That would not only lower plant population, but it would lower the amount of CO2 taken in by living plants because young plants take in more CO2 than well established plants.
On top of that humans are cutting down trees for paper, pencils, firewood, and other items that "must be had."  Again the population is reduced, cutting the amount of CO2 absorbed by plants to be used in photosynthesis.<P>
So although the accumulation of the greenhouse effect should, theoretically, cause plants to flourish, this is not the case.  Instead the effects of global warming are causing the environment to change making the plant population less efficient in using CO2.  If the current trend toward global warming isn't altered, the blue and white marble will end up a barren desert rather than a green paradise of plant life.<P>

  The greenhouse effect which keeps our earth habitable contain gases such as CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, water vapor, and CFC's.  As these gases are expended into our atmosphere they can remain there for several years and even decades.  This action causes what is known as global warming and which is becoming a very big problem to our planet.
  Many things contribute to global warming such as production and emmision of CO2, industries, and household products.  Our earth's plants are greatly affected by global warming and because of this many plants can die or even eventually become extinct.
  I feel the only real way to to help the global warming issue is to mkae sure everyone is being informed the best they can be.  The household products are already becoming more safe by limiting the amount of CFC's in the ozone but actual info is the best way to go.

Part 2: Plates are related to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in that when they are burned carbon dioxide is produced.  Trees are burned every year for the purpose of farming.  This is called the slash and burn technique.  New land is bleared by burning in forest regions because old farm land has  been depleted of minerals needed for plants to grow.  The carbondioxide released from the trees when burned accumulates in the atmosphere.  Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may absorb infared radiation reflected from the earth's surface and reflect it back toward the earth raising temperatures-global warming.  Another reason plants are related is because they are an important store of carbon.  When these trees are burned we not only accumulate carbon dioxide, we destroy a way of taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. <P> 

Part 3: The recommendation I have to minimize the greenhouse effect is better forest management.  If better forest management was practiced the trees being cut down would be replaced.

Plants other than trees also contribute to reduction of greenhouse gas.

As far as minimizing the impact of greenhouse gas induced global warming goes, many people are already contributing to this, in such projects like the Global Relief Forests.  Minimizing this problem won't have a huge affect though, until everyone starts contributing.  Doing those little things, you know the ones that seem like such a huge nuisance.

The best way to combat the impact of greenhouse gas induced global warming is by reducing the emission of industrially released greenhouse gases and creating higher emission standards for new cars.  Emissions from some large factories are leading causes in the excessive amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Industries should be forced to maintain high standards in emitting as few greenhouse gases as possible.  The automobile industry should also have to carefully monitor the rate of emission on their new vehicles.  These solutions would not solve the global warming problem, but they would get us headed in the right direction.

A lack of plants is actually the cause of this accumulation. Plants naturally regulate the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through photosynthesis, however when there are fewer plants and there are more outside sources pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than there is plants to take it out, a build up occurs. The burning of the plants releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases. So in effect double the amount of carbon dioxide is being allowed into the atmosphere. In cases such as the frozen arctic tundra, global warming is causing the tundra to unthaw. This now moist  unthawed area of organic matter is now allowed to decompose, the organisms which are decomposing then release large amounts of excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is a big contributor to the green house effect.One way in which we could possibly solve this problem is to stop deforestation world-wide. A way to take carbon dioxide out of the air synthetically could be a possible way to resolve the problem also however it is not feasible. I believe each government should set aside at least 10 million acres which are not already forested and plant groves of trees. These trees should be ones which we could harvest in the future for profits, however a set amount must be maintained.

The rising temperature maybe increasing too fast that plants may not be able to migrate to conditons more favorable.

However, in a faster changing environment, plants that cannot disperse rapidly over long distances may not survive.  Some types of plants might be affcted more than others.  Habitats for tree species are more likely to shift faster than the rate trees can migrate.  Droughts would increase insects, disease, and forest fires, especially where forest are under stress.

Carbon dioxide and other naturally occuring types are supposed to retain warmth in the atmosphere. However, the excessive amounts of these gases present in the atmosphere make  them a little too successful, which can lead to several enviromental imbalances. 

	Plants are involved due to the fact that they require carbon dioxide as an ingredient in photosynthesis. The destruction of tropical rain forests and the cutting down of other vegetation drastically reduces the amount of carbon dioxide used by plants.
