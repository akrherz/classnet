===subject:MnSOD and brain cells
===message:In the February 1st issue of the Des Moines Sunday Register, it was reported that researchers from the University of Kentucky (UK) had identified the enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD).  They reported that MnSOD seems to reduce molecules (free radicals) released by strokes and Alzheimer's that produce further damage to brain cells.  They have also identified that this enzyme occurs in uric acid (or at least that uric acid mimics the activity of MnSOD).  This study is supported by previous research that identified superoxide dismutase for its ability to slow cell death.  (Another "fountain of youth").  The fact that uric acid acts like MnSOD is important because it offers the potential of treatment applications.  This is also the first study that shows that MnSOD plays a key role in blocking the production of the free radical superoxide.<P>UK researchers are currently testing the theory that the damage caused by strokes and Alzheimer's is so great that natural levels of MnSOD are unable to meet the challenge.  In order to test this, they are genetically altering mice and human brain cells to produce high levels of MnSOD.  Preliminary results indicate that higher levels of MnSOD do indeed decrease the level of brain damage seen in mice with induced strokes.<P>The next question that remains to be answered is if uric acid will decrease the effects of a stroke once it has already occured.  Clinical trials with humans could occur in the next five years.

===subject:Bacteriocins
===message:	Traditionally, food manufacturers and consumers have always been concerned about the bacteria living in consumables.  Antibacterial chemicals have, until now, been the orthodox method of controlling the levels of microbes in food.  However, scientists have begun exploring an alternative for killing these bacteria:  proteins called bacteriocins which function as very narrow-spectrum antibiotics.  Bacteriocins are naturally present in food, but only in the past decade have scientists begun to search for the proteins and consider ways to market them.  Getting FDA approval to add purified bacteriocins to food would be a costly process.  Since the bacteria which produce the proteins are natural, however, scientists induce the bacteria to produce bacteriocins, kill the bacteria, and add the dead bacteria cum proteins to food packaging or even the marinades or breading which would be used with the food.  With the popularity of non-chemically treated foods, the use of bacteriocins would serve to protect so-called organic products while selectively eradicating dangerous bacteria in any type of food.

===subject:RNA World Gets Flamed
===message:A current theory in evolution is that RNA was the first molecule that could copy itself and forge chemical bonds.  It’s believed that life arose in scalding settings, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents.  Raw ingredients for RNA assembled in the high temperature atmosphere and oceans--serving as the genetic librarian and molecular workhorse of the cell.  This was till DNA and proteins evolved to do these functions.  Scientist, however had not yet examined what range of temperatures the nucleobases of RNA could survive.<P>

A study described at the American Geophysical Biennial Ocean Science Meeting revealed that the nucleobases [specifically adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U)]
that make up RNA, fall apart within days to years at temperatures near boiling.  A new study revealed that half of the nucleobases degrade within nineteen days to twelve years at 100 degrees Celsius.  A chemist, Matthew Levy from the University of California, says that this time period for life to evolve is too fast.  A, G, and U can persist for a million years or more at 0 degrees Celsius, but C’s half-life is 17,000 years.  Levy concludes, “...that perhaps C wasn’t part of the first genetic material.”<P>

A cold Earth is not ruled out to preserve the RNA world.  However, an atmospheric chemist, James Kasting of Pennsylvania State University in University Park, says models still point to a hot primitive Earth.  Kasting concludes:  “...we know so little about how life began that we should not use the stability of nucleobases to constrain our models of Earth’s temperatures.”<P>

===subject:Schizophrenia
===message:<P>For a while now geneticists have been trying to link Schizophrenia to a genetic disorder (SN: 11/4/95), but first attempts focused on people exhibiting a broad range of symptoms. People with schizophrenia are diagnosed as having disorganized thinking, bizarre delusions,  and negative social attitudes. This time the geneticists targeted a certain section on chromosome 6. The study consisted of 183 people from 10 Canadian families. About one quarter of the participants were diagnosed as schizophrenic. Their seemed to be correlation with the more psychotic ones behavior the stronger an indication of the presence of gene in question on the sixth chromosome.

===subject:Lab animal health concerns
===message:	The National Research Council (NRC) said in its report, Biomedical Models and Resources, that animal overcrowding in research facilities is threating animal disease models.  In the report the NRC stressed that animal overcrowding is creating the perfect circumstances for possible infectous disease outbreaks.  These outbreaks could eliminate irreplaceable study animal populations.<P>  
	The National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) responded by agreeing that the problem was urgent and something must be done to solve it.  The NCRR plans to develop more reseach facilities.  The facilities would not only provide more space, but would be specialized to ensure that populations do not cross and spread disease.  By implementing its plans, the NCRR would "significantly increase the current capacity" for animals in research facilities.<P> 
	Despite its good intentions, the NCRR remains limited in its ability to deal with these nation wide problems.  The 1999 NCRR budget proposed by President Clinton has just $7.8 million out of its total $108 million included for the improvement of animal facilities.

===subject:Cortisol
===message:Alfred Sapse after years of promoting his theory that a stress hormone plays a role in the development of Aids, cancer, multiple sclerosis, and other devastating diseases is finally being joined by other researchers.  If they're right, drugs that block the stress hormone cortisol could transform the treatment of millions of people. Critics say that although high concentrations of cortisol do occur in Aids patients, they are the result not the cause of the disease. Sapse and others back their findings by pointing to several European studies which have shown that concentration of cortisol in the blood of Aids patients can reach immune punishing values.  Sapse predicts the drug he founded procaine HCI, or anticortisol will reverse immune decline caused by cortisol.  In an unpublished study, Sapse and his colleagues explored the drugs benefits in 20 patients with either Aids or HIV, after being treated with the anticortisol drug the concentration of CD4 T lymphocytes, the infection fighting white cells that decline dramatically during the course of Aids improved from 140 cells per cubic millimeter to 360 cells per cubic millimeter.  Sapse says the patients became asymptomatic after the treatment.  Similiar results were also founded in a pilot study taken in Sao Paul, Brazil this time on 40 people showing symptoms of HIV. <P>
