Ole Brix, A. Bårdgard, S. Mathisen, N. Tyler, M. Nuutinen, S. G. Condo, and B. Giardina.  1990.  Oxygen transport in the blood of arctic mammals: adaptation to local heterothermia.  Journal of Comparative Physiology B 159:655-660.

Brix and colleagues examined the temperature dependence of hemoglobin oxygen affinity in three mammals (reindeer, musk ox, and human) to see how regional differences in body temperature might affect oxygen delivery to the tissues, and to see whether the hemoglobin of arctic mammals is better suited to delivering oxygen to cold tissues than is the hemoglobin of humans.  Because temperature affects pH  as well as having a direct effect on Hb-O2 affinity they examined temperature effects across a range of pH values.

The authors measured oxygen affinity of hemoglobin using several methods, all of which gave similar results.  Results are presented as P50, or partial pressure of oxygen at which a hemoglobin solution is half (50%) saturated with oxygen.

P50 values vary with pH, being higher (meaning lower oxygen affinity) at low pH.  At any pH, P50 values for reindeer and musk ox are higher than that of the human.  At a uniform body temperature of 37° C, the difference in oxygen saturation of arterial and venous blood (an index to the amount of oxygen delivered to tissues) is almost equal in all three species.  The absolute amount delivered by musk ox is about 23% lower because they have a lower hematocrit than reindeer or humans.  Hematocrit is the fraction of blood volume that is taken up by red blood cells. When venous blood is at low temperature (20° C), however, oxygen delivery drops by 70% for the human, but only 57% for reindeer and 46% for musk ox. It appears that arctic mammals have hemoglobin structures modified to enhance delivery of oxygen to tissues at low temperature, permitting them to use regional heterothermy to conserve energy without compromising oxygen delivery.

This research would add some interesting comparative information to Wallace’s textbook in the part of chapter 38 titled Respiratory Pigments and Oxygen Transport, on page 847-848.  As it is, the book doesn’t mention that temperature, and in particular, regional differences in body temperature, can have any effect at all on hemoglobin oxygen delivery.

The article tests factors that affect the rate of milk synthesis in mothers.  Previous research has shown that milk production is closely related to the appetite of the baby.  This fact is rather surprising considering the amount of variation in appetite that a baby has day-to-day, including the frequency of breast feeding and the amount of milk the baby drinks.  It has been often thought that the frequency of breast feedings influenced the amount of milk produced, but previous studies have found no solid correlations.  More recent studies have shown that the amount of milk the mother produces has more to do with "the degree to which an infant empties the breast."  The researchers who published this paper wanted to determine exactly what the relationship between the degree of emptying and the amount of milk produced (on a short-term basis) was.<P>
To test the relationship three studies were undertaken.  In Study 1, the volume of milk each mother gave was recorded as a percentage of their total daily milk expression (by the way, I think ‘milk expression' is a scientific euphemism for pumping out the milk).  The researchers also recorded the time of day of each milk expression and the interval between them.<P>
In Study 2 the rate of milk synthesis was calculated by measuring the volume of the breast between milk expressions  (I'm sure measuring breast volume was a tricky feat).  The researchers determined the volume of milk produced by measuring the changes in breast size before and after milk expression and the weight of the milk given. <P>
Study 3 tested how milk synthesis was affected by altering the breast feeding regimes.  By varying different aspects of breast feeding (it would take too long to describe all the ways), the researchers calculated the changes in the rates of milk synthesis by subtracting the prefeeding rates from the postfeeding rates.<P>
This study showed several things.  First of all, it showed that measuring breast volume was a good way to determine the amount of milk produced (this had also been shown in a previous study by the same researchers).  Generally speaking the researchers found that milk production varied with the time of day of the feedings and the intervals between feedings.  The paper notes that circadian rhythms of the constituents of the milk as well as milk production were dictated by the infant's feeding patterns, but circadian rhythms couldn't explain the pattern of milk expression.  The researchers suggest further studies about the circadian rhythms of milk production.<P>
The researchers also found that milk production was inconsistent with the current model.  According to their studies, milk production was greater than normal if the intervals between breast feedings were short and greater than normal if intervals were long.  Unsurprisingly, they also found that this pattern was greatly different between mothers.  In addition, the studies found great variability between the degree of emptying and the rate of milk synthesis during 24 hour periods.  On a longer term, however, degree of breast feeding did have an impact on the milk synthesis.<P>
This study illuminates a few of the short term mechanisms of milk production.  The emphasis on milk synthesis as a function of the degree of breast emptying suggests that inhibitory substances may leave the breast with the milk.  Because of this milk synthesis would rise as more inhibitory substances left with the milk.<P>
This paper might fit in with the chapter on animal reproduction.  The book doesn't say much about lactation, but it is a defining characteristic of mammals and would be worth the space.

This experiment was performed on 80 male rats.  Thier diets 
were changed from cansien to soy protein.  Prior to feeding, 
the rats recieved one of four antagonist treatments followed 
by a feeding of 5 mL of either casien or its composite amino 
acids in solution.  The antagonist treaments either 
consisted of opioid antagonists or a choleocystokinin.  All 
of these were administered in .25 mL of a saline as a 
carrier via injection.  Fifteen minutes later, the rats were 
fed either casien or amino acid solutions.  After a 
conditioning period (14 days), the rats were treated with 
the antagonists for seven days.  Body weight gain and intake 
were measured.  Eight days later, two hours after feeding, 
the rats were decapitated and frozen after a blood sample 
was collected.  Gastrointestinal tract content and mass were 
measured.<P>
<P>
The antagonists influenced intake when the rats were given 
pre-meal casien but not in the rats given pre-meal amino 
acids.  The results indicate that casien provides opioid and 
CCK associated bioactivities that are involved in intake 
regulation.  Casomorphins and CCK are both regulators of 
gastrointestinal motility and delay gastric emptying.  This 
results in gastric distention and vagally mediated satiety.  
This research suggests that opioid and CCK activities are 
associated with intact casien to accelerate the onset of 
satiety and reduce intake of meal-fed animals.  Other 
measured paremeters that were affected in the same way 
included body weight accretion, fecal output, and 
gastrointestinal tissue mass.<P>
<P>
This research suggestst that milk contains properties that 
may enhance the onset of satiety which would reduce 
incidence of obesity.  If proved, this research would 
benifit dairy farmers by increasing the market for thier 
product.<P>

A good place to put this in the book would be in chapter 37

In this research, the effects of testosterone on the forearm musculature of normal and castrated leopard frogs were observed.  During the mating of frogs, the male mounts the female and waits for her to deposit the eggs and the subsequent opportunity for fertilization.  During this time, other males may attempt to subvert his position.  Specialized muscles utilized for clasping have been identified in male leopard frogs.  The authors thus postulated that leopard frogs would make an ideal model for studying the effects of androgens on muscle development.<P>

Five groups of frogs were used in the study:  Placebo, Testosterone, Castrated/Placebo, Castrated/Testosterone, and Control.  Testosterone was administered to the frogs via an implanted 5 mg pellet.  After six weeks, the frogs were terminated and dissected.  The authors identified both testosterone-responsive and non-responsive muscle groups.  In both the Testosterone and Castrated/Testosterone groups, the mass of the testosterone-responsive muscles had 28% to 164% more mass than in the placebo and control groups.  Castration had no effect on the frogs' response to testosterone and had no negative effects on muscle mass.<P>

<P>
Houstek and Holub examined the mild cold acclimation (22 degrees C for three weeks) of two groups of hairless mice, those that are immunocompetent and those that are immunodeficient, and the effects it has on the amount of Brown Adipose tissue (BAT) present. The athymic nude mice of the BALB backround are used as the immunodeficient mice while BFU mice are immunocompetent. Thermogenesis occurs in brown adipose tissue.  This tissue is usually abundant in newborns and decreases in adult rodents but can be reactivated by cold acclimation.  Hairless mice are used because they have a lower insulation factor when compared to other rodents and the effects of thermogenesis can be seen more easily.    <P>
<P>
The authors use the interscapular portion of BAT as the amount measured for analysis at temperatures of 28 and 22 degrees C.  Results are presented as total weight of BAT, BAT protein and BAT/body weight ratio.  Hamster UCP-an antibody is also measured because it determines the thermogenic potential of the BAT. <P>
<P>
Both groups of hairless mice respond to cold acclimation by generating UCP and increasing the thermogenic ability of the BAT. The cold-induced increase of the thermogenic capcity is much higher than in the immunodeficient mice than he immunocompetent and this is due to the greater amount of BAT produced in the immunodeficient mice.  A T-cell defect in the immunodeficient mice may be responsible for low amounts of BAT in the normal environment and then a great increase during the cold accimation because of hypothermia taking place in the surface tissues.  This represents an important adaptive response in the immunodefient mouse.  It appears that the immune system of the mouse is related to the thermogenic tissue of the body. 
<P>
Although there is not very much said about brown adipose tissue in the text, it would add something interesting to Chapter 39 about the immune system.  Since human babies are born with a large amount of BAT some sort of comparitive information could be provided.

Andrea G. Bodnar, Michel Ouellette, Maria Frolkis, Shawn E. Holt, Choy-Pik Chiu, Gregg B. Morin, Calvin B. Harley, Jerry 
W. Shay, Serge Lictsteiner and Woodring E. Wright.  1998. Extension of Life-Span by Introduction of Telomerase into 
Normal Human Cells.  Science  Vol. 279  January 16, 1998, pp 349-352. <P>

In this article, Bodnar and her colleagues described how normal human cells undergo a finite number of cell divisions and then ultimately enter a non dividing state called replicative senescence.  Human telomeres consist of repeats of  the sequence TTAGGG/CCCTAA at chromosome ends; these repeats are synthesized by the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase.  Telomerase is not expressed in most human somatic tissues and telomere and telomere length is significantly shorter.  Their work tested a hypothesis which proposes that cells become senescent when progressive telomere shortening, during each division, produces a threshold telomere length. Thus, telomere shortening can be viewed as a  "molecular clock" that triggers senescence. 
<P>

Their research was set up to examine the effect of telomerase expression on the life-span of normal human somatic tissue cells. In order to do this, they first cloned the human telomerase reverse transcription subunit (hTRT) and then demonstrated how telomerase activity can be reconstituted by transient expression of hTRT in normal human diploid cells, which express low levels of the template RNA component of telomerase (hTR) but do not express hTRT.  This provided the opportunity to manipulate 
telomere length and test the hypothesis that telomere shortening causes cellular senescence. <P>

hTRT- (negative) normal cells were transfected with two different hTRT expression constructs.  One construct was engineered for increased translational efficiency by removal of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of hTRT and creation of a Kozak consensus sequence. This engineered hTRT cDNA was cloned downstream of the MPSV promoter.  The second construct consisted of the complete (native) hTRT cDNA cloned downstream of the SV40 promoter in pZeoSV.  In the first experiments they compared the life-span of stable clones transfected with MPSV-hTRT (myeloproliferative sarcoma virus) versus "vector only" clones, and in the second experiments, they compared the life-span of activity-positive and activity negative stable clones 
containing integrated SV40-hTRT constructs. <P>

The authors measured telomere lengths to determine if the hTRT reconstituted telomerase acts on its normal chromosomal substrate.  They found that telomeres in the hTRT- cells decreased in length, whereas telomeres in the hTRT+ cell which were transfected with a MPSV-hTRT vector increased in length. <P>

The authors also investigated the effect of telomerase expression on the life-span of normal cells by comparing the growth of hTRT+ and hTRT- clones and found that 30 out of 33 hTRT- clones showed the expected slowing of growth by the typical age.  In contrast, the hTRT+ clones transfected with MPSV-hTRT exceeded the mean life-span of the hTRT- clones by ~20 doublings. <P>

The authors used a senescence-associated beta-galactosidase biomarker to stain the cell cultures to indicate the relative state of cellular aging in their experiments. <P>

The results of this experiment indicate that telomere loss in the absence of telomerase is the intrinsic timing mechanism that controls the number of cell divisions prior to senescence.  These findings have significance in that cloned normal diploid cells could replace established tumor cell lines in studies of biochemical and physiological aspects of growth and differentiation; long-lived normal human cells could be used for the production of normal or engineered biotechnology products, and that expanded populations of normal or genetically engineered rejuvenated cells could be used for autologous or allogeneic cell and 
gene therapy.  Thus, the ability to extend cellular life-span while maintaining the diploid status, growth characteristics and gene expression pattern typical of young normal cells has important implications for biological research the pharmaceutical industry and for medicine. <P>

This research could give more detail and fundamental support to what is already mentioned about telomeres in Chapter 15 of the Campbell textbook in the section titled "Noncoding Sequences and Gene Duplications Account for Much of a Eukaryotic Genome" on page 354.  <P>

http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/00429/bibs/8197004/81970331.htm  (5 May 1998).<P>

This was a study to see what pathways lymph and cells are transported through the tonsils of a young pig.  The tonsils of the soft palate of a pig are the main oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue--they are the main producers of lymphocytes that may migrate to other mucosal sites to maintain immunity.  Lymphocytes in most species migrate through the body by passing from the blood to lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes.  In a pig however, the lymphocytes travel via the lymph node parenchyma to the blood.  The direct pathway of lymph from the tonsils to the body had not been clearly defined.<P>

This experiment used Mercox-casting and light microscopy methods.  Seventeen large white Landrace pigs, 6-10 weeks old and 14-20 kg in weight were obtained.  Half were killed with and overdose of pentobarbitone sodium.  From there, the tonsils were removed from the pigs, immersed in fixative, and processed.  Sliced sections were mounted on slides to be annalyzed by an electron microscope.  The other half of pigs were then killed with pentobarbitone, then Mercox was injected in the subepithelium paranchyma of the tonsils. Scientist could see under the electron microscope, Mercox had flowed into intracellular spaces of the subepithelium, lymphoepithelium and lymphatic sinuses.<P>  

Looking at the results, the scientists saw Mercox formed a network of casts within the the three spaces--subepithelium, lymphoepithelium and lymphatic sinuses.  It also penetrated the parafollicular tissue between the follicles. In the 45 tonsillar sections examined, the scientists concluded that lymphatic sinuses appeared to be a significant pathway for migrating lymphocytes from the tonsillar lymophoid tissue.<P>

I think that this information should go on pages 830-831, under the heading, "The Lymphatic System Returns Fluid to the Blood and Aids in Body Defense."  It would add value by showing an example of a different type of transportation of the immune system that is unlike the human lymphatic system.<P>

<P>The Heart is one of the bodies most essential organs. So when even a small part of the hear becomes abnormal, such as the heat valves, their can be dire consequences. In the cases in question the heat valves contained bone. Obviously bone has no place in our hearts. These bony structures caused varied  problems such as hear murmurs to hear failures.

<P>The cause of the bony growth seems to be the extreme case of simple calcification.  The main differences being the presence of osteoprotien. “Osteoprotien just doesn't belong in heart valves” . In samples collected from 206 patients almost all had calcification, and 30 had bony growths. The really strange part of the bony growths is the cellular organization needed. “it’s bizarre” .

<P>Reasons for the growths are still unclear. It is known that calcification can occur from repeated stress,and hear valves never get rest. This is one theory but in no way explains the cellular organization needed for bone growth. Another theory involves macrophages somehow abetting osteprotien production in the valve cells.  Just exactly how these tissue groups interact is still unclear so this leaves many questions still to be answered. It appears that even pig tissue valves undergo the calcification after xenotransplantaion, but actual bone growth has not been report in the replacement tissue. 

<P>This specific type of information does not seem to directly fit into the Campell text in any specific section at this time. My thinking is that when the research group discovers more about the tissue interaction it would be a good example of tissue interaction when the book deals with tissue formation and cell to cell communication. It seem like tissue to tissue interaction is a logical extrapolation of the cell to cell interactions discussed in the Campell test thus far.

In their experiment, Perez-Campo, et al studied the relationship between oxidative stress of an organism and the maximum life span (MLSP) of that organism.  In animals with relatively long MlSPs, compared to other animals in their phylongeny, the levels of free radicals are signifigantly lower.  In other words, the less free radicals present in the body, the longer the organism will survive.  In addition, the higher the success rate in DNA transcription repair, the longer the organism's life span.  <P>
The mitochondria is the prime consumer of oxygen in cellular processes.  Up to 90% of the oxygen taken up by a cell is processed in the mitochondria.  Due to the presence of mitochondrial DNA, the more oxygen free radicals produced during respiration, the more likely it is that the DNA will be altered.  Therefore, animals with a low oxygen free radical production will be more likely to live longer, and with fewer health problems.  <P>
Two main factors seem to be related to species longevity.  First, the low production of free radicals is key to maintaining a healthy cell environment.  Second, a low error rate in DNA located near a prime producer of free radicals, such as the mitochondria.  The more free radicals an organism puts out, and the more errors that those free radicals cause to DNA, altering the cell, the shorter the expected life span of that organism.  Free radicals pose a tremendous health threat to any and all organisms that produce or come in contact with them.  Even though there is evidence for an inherited component to aging, the presence of free radicals in the environment will negate any possible positive effects those genes may have.  The presence of free radicals in the enviroment poses an extreme health risk to the human population, and more research is needed to combat this problem.<P>
In chapter 39 of the campbell text, a short paragraph is devoted to aging in plants.  However, the text is extremely vague and deals mainly with the effects of ethylene on aging.  The text contains no reference to free radicals.  This is clearly an important topic, and much can be said about the mechanisms and dangers of free radical production and it's effects on life spans.

54 female Grant's gazelle of reproductive age were autopsied 
in northern Tanzania, East Africa.  The animals were dissected 
within 10-20 minutes of being shot to death. Cadavers, foetuses,
and uterus were all weighed.  Samples were taken for a carbohydrate
analysis.  Number of placentae and foetal crania were collected
in formalin for later examination.  And blood samples were
taken from 26 adults and 7 foetuses at the start of the 
dissection.<P>

Ovulation was found to be equal at both right and left ovaries,
however 81-25% of corpora lutea were on the left.
Uterine changes imply that the animal was highly efficient, 
with a disproportionately large foetus for maternal size, with 
a high number of placentomes of efficient design.  
Lactation ceased when foetal weight was an estimated 5-4, 7-5 
months.  Weight of the mammary gland was correlated with the 
percentage of graze,  and the gland tended to produce more milk
in the wet season.
Adrenal glands of non pregnant animals were large , due to lactational 
stress.  Gluconeogenesis offered no clues as to its roles in
neonatal survival.  Body weight was higher in the dry season, 
and highest in animals with foetuses greater than 3000g.<p>
Dates of conception and birth were calculated from the foetal
brain weight as well as body weight and crown rump length, 
and the mean of these three predictors were taken.
This gave the peak births to be in June, at the onset of the dry 
season when food requirements of lactation aare sub optimal in 
availability, so the survival of the calves suggests a high mortality 
in the first 1-2 months after birth.<P>
This species appears better adapted to a dry environment, 
being that graze is of less value than browse in maintaining
maternal fitness, but is of greater importance to lactation.

A reduction in the level of ion pumping during aestivation was not demonstrated in any tissues.  Measurements of level of the enzyme Na+/K+ -ATPase in skeletal muscle, ventricle, kidney and brain showed no change in the amount of enzyme in aestivating frogs.  Reduction of ATP in the liver and reduction in level of total adenylates may be due to the adaption of tissues to lower energy turnover.<br>This would go well into Chapter 9: Cellular Respiration: Harvesting Chemical Energy, out of the Campbell text.

Website: http://www.aps.uoguelph.ca/~swatland/ch8.6.htm  Swatland first gives us the respiration quotient.  The respiratory quotient is the volume of carbon dioxide exhaled divided by the volume of oxygen used.  He also explains that small animals with a high surface area compared to their volume ratio have a greater rate of respiration per unit of body weight than large animals, caused by the greater rate of heat loss in small animals. However, metabolic rate also may expressed as the rate of oxygen consumption. Here are his finding considering oxygen consumption.  Specific oxygen consumption (oxygen consumption per kilogram of body mass),log V(oxygen) /Mass = log 0.676 - 0.25 log Mass. The values for the specific oxygen consumption of meat animals usually fit this equation reasonably well. As a conversion factor, 1 liter of oxygen (at 0oC, 760 mm Hg) gives rise to approximately 20 kJ when used for oxidative metabolism, but the relationship of metabolic rate to body mass is much more complicated when an animal is growing in size. In mammals there is generally a rapid increase in specific metabolism after birth. After reaching a peak, specific metabolism then declines gradually as animals grow heavier. He also explains heat production on the cellular level. Energy requirements for biosynthesis and maintenance may be expressed in terms of chemical energy as moles ATP. For example, in cultured mammalian cells, 1.6 x 10 E-11 moles ATP per cell are required for biosynthesis, while a greater amount, 2.9 x 10 E-11 moles ATP per cell, is required for maintenance.I believe this research would add volume and hands on knowledge to the section Thermoregulation maintains body temperature within a range conductive to mtabolism. P. 898-899.  Since there is little about oxygen consumption and its relation to the metabolic rate.

The Yale researchers were interested in helix association within structured RNA.  It is known that RNA structure formation is dependent on helix.  The researchers docked a substrate helix into an active site of a certain type of ribosome.  The RNA was analyzed in atomic detail showing the researchers patterns in the combinations of base pairs that apparently created an important helix packaging motif.  This was a large discovery in the role of helix in structured RNA.  <P>

This research could be included in Campbell's Biology, Fourth Edition in chapter 16 where many aspects of RNA are discussed.  This research probably would not be the essential to this book, but it is interesting to see some examples of what leading researchers are working on today.

Kastikaros and Shine began this study in order to document the sexual dimorphism of Adelotus Brevis in more detail, examine sex specific feeding habits, describe the mating system of a free-living population, and to quantify the relationship between body size and reproductive success in males.<P>

Several methods were used to gather data.  To begin with the author's examined preserved specimens by using digital calipers to measure snout-urostyl length, head length, head width, tusk length, arm length from wrist to elbow, and tibial length.  Bilateral characters were measure on the right side only.  To determine the dietary hebits of Adelotus the stomach contents were removed from the specimens and identified.  The volume of each prey was estimated by fluid displacrment.  They then determined the proportional composition of each taxonomic group, both in number and volume.<P>

The field study was carried out from November through February of 1990 to 1993, which correlated with the breeding season of Adelotus.  Male specimens were located by their calls or their nests.  Females were captured when approaching calling males.  Other specimens were caught in pitfall traps (ten litre buckets set in the ground with a plastic fence leading individuals into the buckets).  Each of the specimens captured had their snout-urostyl length measured and distinct color patterns sketched.<P>

The result of this study showed that Adelotus Brevis display extreme sexual dimorphism.  Adult males were significantly larger in all variables.  There is also a difference shown in what the different sexes eat.  Body size affected the frequency of eating in males, but not in females.  Prey type was also affected by sex.  Males of Adelotus eat primarily molluscs, while females ate primarily arthropods.  There was also evidence to support the author's hypothesis that the larger males have a higher reproductive success.   <P>

If this research were to be added to the Campbell text it would fit in well in several areas.  The first would be in chapter 37 during pages 796 and 797 when it is talking about varying of diets and feeding mechanisms.  If this research were to be added it would illustrate the importance of diet in a way people usually don't think of:  reproductive success.  It would also fit in well with chapter 21 on the evolution of populations, on page 432.  This research helps to show the evelutionary differences between sexes, and how that has changed their diet and sexual slectiveness.<P>

<br>
At Movile Cave in Romania, researchers have discovered an ecosystem in which none of the organisms use sunlight of any type for survival.  Photosynthesis, is therefore unneccessary for life in that area.  Hydrogen sulfide is used for energy instead of sunlight, like the animals found near the hydrothermal vents on the floor of the ocean.  This cave was discovered in 1986, and it had some isolated compartments filled with air, and flooded entryways and paths.  A total of 48 invertebrate species have been identified there, including bacteria, beetles, leeches, spiders, and shrimplike crustaceans.  Surprisingly, 33 of these species were unknown before found there.  The bacteria make up the base for the food chain, and float in little groups on top of the water.  They form colored mats from yellowish-orange to white.  It is believed that methane gas bubbling up keeps them afloat.  These bacteria can also be found on the rock walls.  
<br>
Researchers studied proportions of carbon and nitrogen istopes in the bacteria.  Through this, they traced the food chain's energy flow from the bottom up.  They found, through the chemistry, that sulfur was the factor that the cave life depended on.  Since the animals do not eat anything from the surface, nothing that had the sun's energy to grow is consumed.  
<br>
This article was very interesting.  I had never heard of any type of living food chain surviving without photosyntesis found somewhere at the begining or even throughout it.   It was informative and should be used to explore the possibility of continuing life in other places without the aid of energy from the sun.  
<br>
I think this information could be used in chapter 25, after a section called: The Origin of Photosynthesis.  It could be and opposite representation.  There is very little said in the book about life without photosynthesis, and this would be interesting to learn more about.

<P>
	Buono, Heaney, Cline, and Leichliter introduce the problem of cardiac distress due to a combination of factors stemming from prolonged, constant-load exercise in the heat, which
results in a downward drift in stroke volume (SV), while simultaneously there is a compensatory rise in heart rate (HR). This phenomenon, termed "cardiovascular drift", is the second leading cause of cardiac related death.   The subjects for the study were five healthy, heat-acclimated, female volunteers who had to complete a 6-h heat exposure in which the subjects walked the first 20 min on a motorized treadmill set at 3 mph and 3% grade, followed by 40 min of seated rest each hour. 
<P>
	Each subject's maximum oxygen uptake. HR, SV, mean skin temperature, and core temperature were measured during each of the six 20-min exercise sessions.  HR was measured using a trans-sternal Polar HR monitor. Skin temperature was measured on the right shoulder, chest, thigh, and calf using Y.S.I temperature probes. Mean skin temperature (Tsk) was calculated using the Ramanathan (1964) formula.  Core temperature (Tre) was recorded using a Sheridan rectal temperature probe inserted 10 cm past the anal sphincter. Cardiac output (Q) was measured via CO2 rebreathing using the equilibration method originally developed by Collier (1956) and later modified by Jones and Campbell (1982). A fast responding Beckman LB-2 CO2 analyzer was used to measure end-tidal and equilibrium gas tensions. SV was calculated by dividing cardiac output by HR.  Data collected for each of these dependent variables was analyzed using a repeated measures MANOVA. Significance was set at the p<0.05 level.
<P>
	HR significantly (p<0.05) increased 24 bpm, or 19%, from hour 1 to hour 6. Conversely, SV significantly decreased during the 6 h of heat exposure by 21%, or 14 ml/beat. Core body temperature increased continuously throughout the study, rising from 37.2 C during the first exercise bout to 38.3 C during the sixth exercise bout.
<P>
	The most important finding of the study by Buono et al is that during prolonged exercise in the heat, cardiovascular drift can occur without a concomitant increase in skin blood flow. This is evidenced by the fact that both HR and SV demonstrated significant drift throughout the 6-h heat exposure, yet skin blood flow and forearm blood flow both plateaued by hour 2 and showed no further changes.  It is believed that a progressive rise in skin blood flow leads to a fall in central venous pressure,  which ultimately decreases SV.
<P>
	It has previously been shown that cardiovascular drift is linearly related to whole-body dehydration. However, in this study, dehydration was essentially prevented by a vigorous fluid replacement regimen, yet significant cardiovascular drift still occurred.  The researchers believe that cardiac drift can still occur despite good hydration, plateaued skin blood flow, and plateaued forearm blood flow.
<P>
The information found in this article would make a good supplement to chapter 38.  The information from the article could go under the section on cardiovascular disease (page 832), since human health are at risk when cardiac drift occurs.  In addition, the authors of the book could include another article about how other animals adapt to heat.

Anatomy and Embryology
Abstract volume 195 Issue 1 (1996) pp 51-63
Early expression of recoverin in a unique population of neurons in the human retina

In normal human photoreceptors, cone bipolar cells and sparse cells in the ganglion cell layer a calcium-binding protein called recoverin has been reported as being present. In the adult human retina, small populations of recoverin-containing cells are present in the ganglion cell and nerve fiber layers. However, in the fetal retina growing concentrations are seen on the inner and outer boarders of the nerve fiber layer.  At 13 weeks these cells express recoverin very intensely, at 24 weeks the cells are mature with large soma sizes and varying numbers of short processes. After 24 weeks a noticeable decrease in soma size results continuing to gradually reduce until 13 weeks until birth where a drastic drop to adult levels is seen. 
The recoverin-immunoreactive cells in the ganglion cell layer show distinctly different morphological and developmental features form the principle neurons and glial cells in the retina.  The expression of recoverin in the neurons may be significant in maintaining a Centro-peripheral gradient of calcium concentration in the premature retina. By playing a role in the concentration gradient they probably also play a role in determining the polarity of the differentiating ganglion cells and the growth of their axons in a centrifugal spatiotemporal order.
	This article pinpoints the necessity of the recoverin protein in the proper development of many vertebrate retinas. This is a crucial piece of information as we try to combat blindness in human eyes. However, I do not see how we could alter the proper development of our eyes when most of the development occurs in fetal gestation. I am wondering if concentrations vary in different subjects or if there is just one minor window where the concentrations must be for normal development. Another question that I might have for the researchers of this protein is 'Is this protein hormonally induced by the mother?' I believe that this research is very viable in our quest for better living standards.

Lee studied the evolution of metatarsals in reptiles, specifically turtles.  Previous research suggested that the hooked fith metatarsal was merely derived from the fifth distal tarsal.  Lee's research suggest more strongly that the hooked fifth metatarsal is an adaptation, a modified metatarsal.  Lee believes the hooked fifth metatarsal evolved as a lever-like tool, analogous to the heel bone of mammals.  It allows greater range of motion and extension of the turtle foot.
 
This research could be of value in chapters so and 35, which discuss evolution, homology, and phylogeny.  I think it illustrates that evolution is not just a process of the past, but is continuous.

===message:The paper described is :
<P>
R.E.Clark and L.R.Squire, "Classical Conditioning and Brain Systems: The Role of Awareness". 1998. Science vol 280: 77-81.
<P>
In this paper, Clark and Squire examine the role of awareness in conditioning responses in humans. They study the eye-blink response, which is a common automatic and reflexive response. A type of conditioning, called simple delay conditioning, is achieved by providing a stimulus called the "conditioned stimulus" , which is a tone, or white noise, just before an air puff, which is called an "unconditioned stimulus". The tone and air puff are designed to end simultaneously. Initially, the eye responds to the air puff by blinking, but not the tone. But over several trials, the eye learns to anticipate the relationship between the tone and the air puff, and gets conditioned to blink protectively as soon as the tone is heard. Research has shown that this kind of conditioning is acquired by amnesic patients at the same rate as normal volunteers, indicating that this kind of conditioning requires only the learning circuits in the cerebellum, and does not use the conscious memory circuits found in the hippocampus.
<P>
Clark and Squire examine a different kind of conditioning, called "trace conditioning" . In this kind of conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (tone or white noise) does not end simultaneously with the unconditioned stimulus (air puff) . Rather, there is a delay between the tone and the air puff. As a result, a trace of the memory of the tone must remain in order for the eye to get conditioned to the air puff. Clark and Squire’s results demonstrate that trace conditioning is not acquired by amnesic patients. For normal volunteers, awareness was a prerequisite for achieving trace conditioning. The volunteers who received detailed explanations about the sequence of the tone and the air puff were able to achieve conditioning, but those who were not aware of the relationship did not.
<P>
In summary, therefore, Clark and Squire conclude that while delay conditioning involves only the cerebellum, trace conditioning involves both the hippocampus and the cerebellum. The hippocampus serves to create awareness of the relationship and the cerebellum helps to develop the conditioning response. In a cognitive sense, therefore, the researchers conclude that the hippocampus and cerebellum have to act together for people to have awareness about the knowledge they acquire.
<P>
This research would add information to the discussion about memory on pages 1021-1022 in  Chapter 44 of Campbell’s text .
