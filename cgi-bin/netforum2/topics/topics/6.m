===subject:aging/immortality
===message:Regarding the idea of allowing humans to "live forever," I thnk perhaps it's more important to first find cures/vaccines for the more worrisome problems of living, i.e. cancer, AIDS, heart disease, etc.  Until we can reasonably protect ourselves from these ailments, what good would living forever serve?  
 
I wonder if the human body can withstand immortality in terms of wear and tear.  Just because my body may not age, it will certainly take a beating structurally over time.  Would it be better to be 150 and bed-ridden because of arthritis or Alzheimer's?  What function would I be serving in society?
 
As well, immortality would have dire ramifications on the population of the earth.  Certainly there is some limit to the number of humans whch can inhabitat this earth.  What strain on the resources would  immortality present?
 
For my money, the world needs human immortality like it needs a hole in the ozone layer.

===message:	When the thought of being immortal crosses my mind my first and natural reaction is that it would be great to live forever and never leave our relatives and loved ones behind.  This sounds good at first, but problems would accumulate.  Overpopulation which leads to famine and more pollution.  But then again were not talking about making everybody Superman.  I could not be aging and still get a disease or ran over by a bus.  It is actualy hard for me to discuss this topic because of my lack of knowledge on disease and accidental deaths.  It would be helpful to have statistics on deaths dealing with old age, because these deaths would be eliminated.  I don't think this chemical would do the world any good, but I would approach it with an open-mind and review the information provided.

===message:Not aging sounds great in a sense, but only when you don't think about the overpopulation and the extinction of many animals due to humans "hogging" the world; which is already a problem.  I'd be interested to see what the cosmetic world would do with this if they could get ahold of it.  The world is already obsessed with not aging, being thin and beautiful; this could, if not watched, become a name just to put on things:  "The Fountain of Youth in a Bottle".  I'd also be interested in seeing just what is discovered from the studies.  Will it actually keep cells young, or as the article stated, could it be hazardous?  Cellular immortality being a "bad name in medicine: It's called Cancer".  The other thought that crossed my mind, is maybe this could help people with Alzheimer's and diseases which are caused by aging cells.

===subject:Key to aging
===message:If this is the same chemical, we're talking about a protein that is the core of the enzyme called human telomerase.  And yes, when this enzyme gets overambitious we do end up with cancer as Kim suggested.  It is also related to reverse transcriptase which is the viral enzyme that lets HIV "steal" human cells.  So essentially what allows HIV to replicate has now been found to be an essential aspect of human cell development.

Telomerase helps young, dividing cells by rebuilding the tips of chromosomes, called telomeres (thus telomerase).  Once cells are mature, this function is shut off, but is turned back on again in cancer and there is a similar chemical with a similar function in HIV.  Without telomerase, telomeres shrink and break down and eventually die.

To me, the more important aspect of this chemical is not in providing society with eternal youth (with the dangerous side effects already mentioned by Kim and Ross and Jay), but in the increased knowledge it provides us about cancer and HIV.  Perhaps with this new knowledge we can develop a way to turn off the telomerase and reverse transcriptase in cells that have been hijacked by cancer or HIV.

===message:On the topic of aging, I think a lot of people would give anything to live longer.  Everyone needs to die, but I think giving them the opportunity to do more before they die is good.  It seems as though they have more energy and want to do more while taking this.  It's good to give them an added boost to do more things.  However, the drug needs to be tested immensly so that harm doesn't occur to people.

===message:I think this discovery could, I hope anyway, have positive affects.  After reading the article, I didn't really think of humans living real longer lives, like 50-100 more years.   I thought of the possible benefits of fighting cancer and other diseases to live a healthly older age. I don't think it's a good idea to make humans immortal. All creatures have their time on earth, humans should not have an exception.    If this natural chemical is to work (after much intense reaserch) maybe this discovery could be a cheaper way of fighting cancer, which might help our health care system.  The next older generation is the babyboomers, which is extremely large.  Any kind of research that will help illiminate high cost in health will benefit everyone--young and old.  I'm only assuming of cost, but having a chemical put inside a person seems a lot cheaper than radiation treatments.  (I could be wrong though)  However, very intense research has to be conducted, and may take years before this method can be used.  Or it may never be used if it has a reverse reaction as mentioned in the article.  I agree with Dallas that this can help us learn more about cancer cells and other diseases to find possible cures.

===message:I think that an anti-aging chemical is a bad idea. The world is overpopulated and millions die each year from starvation and other related illnesses. I think immortality is wrong, because it goes completely against nature. I think that with all of the damage we are doing to the world and to each other, it would be a huge mistake to make anyone live here forever. Imagine Adolf Hilter still alive, or imagine Charles Manson living forever. Amd that brings up the aspect of who can and can not use this chemical. If the general population has access to it, would prison inmates as well? Would the tax payers have to support felons with a life sentence for 200 years or more, instead of 50, since they wanted this drug? The world is overpopulated right now, what would happen if no one ever died?

===message:I think that creating an anti-aging chemical is a good idea, but to an extent.  It would be nice to live for 200 years or so, but there are a lot of problems with this.  How would the world overcome overpopulation?  With this drug, it would create huge problems because it would give everyone the possability to live "forever".  On the other hand, wouldn't it be great to keep some of our great minds alive for 200 years?  Can you imagine what Einstien would be capable of doing if he lived until he was that age?  I guess I have mixed opinions on this topic.  I feel that it would be a great sceintific breakthrough, but the overall effects could be very bad.

===message:The Des Moines Registers article pertaining to slowing the aging process, stumped me as far as a personal reaction is concerned. I thought about the idea for a few days, even asking my family and friends.  I have come to the conclusion the growing old is a stage in life, and without it the balance of human nature would be thrown off track.  I am by no means saying that I want people to grow old and die because I am mean, but rather that old age is a part of a persons life and for many it is the best part of their lives.  As I look at it, it would be like discovering a way for new borns to skip the first few years of their lives.  
	To totally flip my opinion around their of course would be advantages to immortality.  One of the most important of these would be time.  It seems like we are pushed along and life and never allowed a break.  If I new that life was going to be longer, I would spread things out a little more.  Wait a while to go to college.  Go travel and see the things that we aften miss.  Find the simple pleasures in life.  Another advantage is simple that the longer we are able to live the greater chance we have to effect the world.

===message:In the messages, I've noticed a theme of concern about overpopulation if this chemical truly can extend life and become commercially available.  Perhaps my message is a blanket response.  Should we ban  research into curing cancer and AIDs because the cures would extend people's lives and contribute to overpopulation?  Should we ban organ transplants because they allow people to live longer and contribute to overpopulation?  Should we ban penicillin and other drugs that help people live longer?I have a sister who successfully fought breast cancer.  I have an uncle who is still alive because of a kidney transplant.  I would have hated to have someone tell me that we aren't going to do anything for them because the world may become overpopulated.  I'm sure each of you has a relative/friend whose life was extended through advances in science.Is this any different?  If I have the opportunity to extend the lives of my loved ones, shouldn't that be the decision of my family?  I don't want to be the one to tell my father/mother/sibling/child that we can't do anything for him/her because there is a famine someplace in Africa.  Are there potential problems?  Absolutely!  But I have faith in man's ability to overcome problems and make this a better place to live.  All I have to do is look at how much better we live today than our ancesters 1,000 years ago or even 100 years ago.

===message:Cloning and extended life by the slowing of the aging fall in the same class as far as I'm concerned.  I think both have some tremendous benefits, but downfalls that far out-weigh them.  Cloning advantages and detractions are more obvious than are the advantages and detractions of the slowing of the aging process.  It is something that needs to be researched and thought through carefull before anyone proceeds too far.  An obvious detraction is the problem of over-population.  This is already becoming a problem in many areas, imagine what it would be like if anyone could live as long as they wanted.  This brings up another problem- who decides who can use this process to continue to live and who can't.

===message:One practical application of telomerase which the pharmaceutical industry can reap the benefits of in the very near future is the production of "immortal" genetically engineered cell lines to produce products such as human insulin.  Such cell lines would increase the production of pharmaceuticals (lowering their cost in the process) since aging cell lines whose telomeres are nearly gone would not have to be recultured periodically. <P>

In addition, the results of this experiment confirm scientists' theories of cellular mechanics.  Since the function of telomerase is to rebuild the telomere structure of the chromosome after it has been "worn away" through repeated divisions, the insertion of a gene into cells which causes telomerase to be produced and getting the results these scientists did is pretty conclusive proof for the theory that telomeres control cellular aging. <P>

===subject:A longer Life is Finnally Here.
===message:	The possibility of eternal life has been a quest for man to chase throughout history.  There were worthy quests such as Ponce de Leon’s journey to Florida in 1513, looking for the fountain of youth and Russian reports during the  cold war claimed that some Ukrainians lived abnormally long lives. If these reports were true, the only hope for a longer life was a to possesses the Ukranian’s  special genes. However, scientists have recently found the true way to a longer life.  A new drug takes advantage of replenishing our biological clock by replacing the telomerases on the end of chromosome. Now it comes to society to decide what to do with the knowledge we possesses.  The problem is a fast moving one, with medicine for a longer life only 5-10yrs in the future. One must make a careful and educated decision on whether or not to take this drug. <P>

	Our generation is first seeing the major benefits of genetics and the possibility of a longer life is certainly one of the most profound to date. Genetics has  changed societies resilience to new  and shocking ideas. Within a year, a sheep has been cloned, a Chicago scientist is ready to clone humans, and now a life elongating drug has been announced. I wonder how long before society feels the need to backlash and slap even more restrictions on genetic research. I believe genetics is mankind’s potentially greatest tool, if only we use it wisely.  It’s very overwhelming all the good and bad this one medicine could do. Everyone would have liked Einstein to live for a hundred plus years in age, but no one wants Saddam Hussein to live any longer than he must. Unfortunately, this medicine provides good and bad all in one. It’s just another dilemma for the world to deal with. <P>

We as human beings have a responsibility to ourselves, our children, and every other living being on this planet to die.  Death is as natural and as required as birth.  To cheat that death, even delay the inevitable, is upsetting the natural balances of our planet.  As if depleting the ozone and killing the very creatures that keep us alive is not enough.  Now we must outlive the Giant Sequoias.<P>  I do not agree with the current trend in research.  Even though cancer and HIV are wiping out tremendous numbers of people in every part of the world, at some point, we must ask if these 'plaugues' are not some sort of natural population control...sort of a 'sorry, this chat room is full' kinda deal.  The earth can take care of itself, and if nature has to keep a check on the human population, then so be it.  Mother Nature was here first, anyway.
