===message:Glycoprotein 120<P>
<P>
	Structure and function of proteins are integrally related.  Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids, all of which have a carboxyl group, a hydrogen group, a nitrogenous base, and an “R” group (this group differs among each amino acid).  The type, number and position of the R group determines the function of the protein; if you change just one of these factors, you will have a totally different protein--possibly one that won’t even function (Audesirk & Audesirk, 1997).<P>
	Glycoprotein 120, also known as gp120, is expressed in the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Type 1 (or HIV-1) (DiSpezio, 1997).    (Glycoproteins are proteins that have a carbohydrate chain attached to them (Audesirk & Audesirk, 1997).)  The gp120 is expressed on the surface of the cell infected by the HIV-1 (Sodroski, et al, 1990).  The HIV-1 virus is a sphere covered with little balls of protein resembling miniature gear shift knobs.  It is these knobs that are the gp120 (Cohen, 1996).  The gp120 is attached to another glycoprotein (gp41) which attaches to the virus membrane.  The CD4 receptor, which is found on the T helper cells, interacts with gp120 causing the T helper cells to be targeted by the HIV-1 virus.  Once gp120 has attached to the CD4 receptor, both gp120 and gp41 are used for the process of fusing to the T helper cells (DiSpezio, 1997).<P>
	The interaction of structure and function for gp120 becomes somewhat difficult to delineate.  The flexibility of this protein, as well as its extensive glycosylation, has made analysis of its structure difficult (Moore, 1997).  It is known, however, that the second conserved (C2) and third variable (V3) regions of gp120 influences the ability of HIV-1 to establish a productive infection in susceptible cells.  It is also known that it is the interaction of C2 and V3 that stabilizes the association of gp120 with gp41.  By substituting glutamine for asparagine at C2, the ability of gp120 to bond to CD4 is reduced, and by changing an arginine to an isoleucine in V3, infectivity is raised to near wild-type levels (Willey & Martin, 1993).  Thus, increasing our understanding of the structure and function of gp120, may increase our knowledge of how to combat the HIV-1.<P>

===message:	Hemoglobin is a vital protein whose function is to transport oxygen from the alveoli (or other breathering apparatuses) throughout the body.  Hemoglobin also serves to transfer the carbon dioxide produced by cellular processes from the tissues back to the lungs.  The protein is found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates and some invertebrates.  (The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia, 1995)  Each red blood cell may hold up to 250 million molecules of hemoglobin.  (Campbell, 1996) <P>
	Hemoglobin is composed of a protein structure and heme groups.  The heme groups are responsible for the actual binding of oxygen.  The quaternary structure of the protein consists of two alpha helixes and two beta chains arranged so as to form a globular structure.  Each polypeptide chain is attached to a heme group.  The heme group itself contains pyrrole rings bound around an Fe 2+ ion.  The ferrous ion binds the oxygen.  The protein methemoglobin, which is produced as a result of genetic mutation, differs from hemoglobin in that the pyrrole rings of the heme group are arranged around a Fe 3+ ion rather than an Fe 2+ ion; the ferric ion is unable to bind oxygen.  Carbon dioxide is transported from body tissues by means of a covalent bond formed with the terminal amino groups of the protein complexes.  (BB 311 Laboratory Manual, 1998) <P>
	The alpha helix of human hemoglobin contains 141 amino acids, and the beta chain contains 146 amino acids.  In humans, the alpha helix begins with the sequence val, leu, ser, pro, and ends with ser, lys, tyr, arg.  The beta chain begins with the sequence val, his, leu, thr, and ends with his, lys, tyr, his.  For a complete listing of the sequence, see ftp://ftp.pdb.bnl.gov/user_group/biological_units/bio3hhb.pdb.  
(G. Fermi, 1998) <P>
	The primary structure of human hemoglobin contains few differences in amino acid sequence compared to the higher primates as opposed to lower animals.  A gorilla’s hemoglobin, for example, contains only one different amino acid in the beta chain while a frog’s has sixty-seven variations.  (Campbell, 1996) <P>

	Hemoglobin is a protein that is essential to humans as well as animals.  Hemoglobin is unique to other proteins in a combination of the following:  it's function, structure, expression in organisms, and the location of it in certain organisms.  <P>
	First of all, hemoglobin is unique in its function.  It is a transporter of oxygen in the blood.  The red color in blood is due to this iron-containing protein (Smolin and Grosvenor 325).  Hemoglobin carries carbon dioxide away from cells for elimination by the lungs (Smolin and Grosvenor 326).  When there isn't enough iron in the blood, the oxygen capacity of the blood is lowered, resulting in lower to nonexistent levels of hemoglobin in the blood.  The name of this disease is iron-deficiency anemia.  Symptoms of this are fatigue, weakness, headaches, and the inability to stay warm in cold temperatures.  In the United States, about eight per cent of women have anemia (Smolin and Grosvenor 328).  Another disorder associated with hemoglobin is sickle-cell anemia.  A red blood cell containing hemoglobin is normally disc-shaped.  A sickle-cell hemoglobin is crescent-shaped.  This disorder can have very negative and lasting consequences.  It can cause inflammation, anemia, and pain (Smolin and Grosvenor 153).  <P>
	Secondly, hemoglobin differs from certain other proteins in structure.  "Hemoglobin is a globular protein with four subunits, tow of one kind (alpha chains) and two of another kind (beta chains)" (Campbell 80).  It possesses a quarternary structure. <P>
	All animals have hemoglobin.  It is found in the red blood cells.  A person's hemoglobin type is inherited.  By eating foods high in iron, a person can increase the amount of hemoglobin manufactured in the blood.  Foods high in iron include liver, dark green leafy vegetables, beef, and beans.  <P>
	Hemoglobin is a very important component of our daily lives.  It has a unique role and differs from other proteins in structure and function, where it's found in organisms and how it is expressed.  <P>

As you read this paper, muscles everywhere in your body are at work, keeping you comfortable, active, and alive.  Your heart beats, your diaphragm contracts and relaxes, making you breath.  Your eyes are moving from left to right (hopefully) as you read...muscles are at work everywhere in your body.  But how do muscles work?<P>
Two of the basic constituents muscles are the proteins actin and myosin.  Striated (skeletal) muscle has bands of myofibrils composed of smaller myofilaments.  The actual muscle contraction comes about from the “sliding” of the two proteins (Campbell, 1996).  The thinner actin bands are pulled towards the middle of the thicker myosin fibers.  This is brought about by the binding of the myosin to the actin by means of a cross-bridge, which pulls the actin filament closer when ATP is broken down and myosin reaches a high-energy state (Campbell, 1996; Holmes, “Understanding...”).  The action of the two proteins is much like that of a rowboat in water, the boat itself being the myosin, the oars being the cross bridges, and the water being the actin.  However, it is important to note that neither filament changes length during contraction of the muscle (Campbell, 1996).  The filaments simply increase in overlap, shortening the overall fiber length.  <P>
Actin and myosin are complex, but compact proteins.  Myosin consists of two heavy and four light chains.  These chains interact to form a helical coil, much like a hemp rope (“Larger...”; “Muscle Fibers...”).  The protein is basically a long coil with globular ends.  Actin is likewise a helical coil of actin monomers, twisted like a rope.  Actin is a simpler polymer than myosin, however, with only two chains linked together (Muscle Fibers...”; “Myofilament...”; Winkelmann, “Protein Structure...”).<P>
Muscle proteins can be found in nearly every part of the human body, in fact, most every eukaryote has some actin and myosin filaments providing movement (Holmes, “Understanding”).  Humans in particular are noteworthy of attention.  The fact that muscle strength increases with added workload shows the adaptability and versatility of the actin-myosin interaction.  <P>

===subject:Protein Assignment - papD
===message:Protein Assignment - Structure and Function of PAPD <P>


One of the key research issues in molecular biology today is to understand the rules for protein folding. During cell division, the information to manufacture a protein is contained in mRNA (messenger RNA), which is created from the DNA. The mRNA travels to the cytoplasm and binds with the ribosomes, where the information is translated into a specific polypeptide chain. <P>

But where is the information stored to fold the protein into the specific configuration (secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures ) that is needed for its function ? It has been recently discovered (see Campbell, 1996, page 83) that a class of proteins called chaperone (helper) proteins are needed for the correct folding. These chaperone proteins themselves are not part of the final molecular structure of the protein. <P>

PapD (pili associated with pylenophritis - D) is a chaperone protein necessary for the correct assembly of macromolecular structures called pili (singular is pilus, Latin for hair ). Pili are organelles expressed at the surface of bacteria that enable them to bind to various surface structures. The pap group of pili allow the bacteria E.coli to bind to the surface of cells in human urinary tracts, resulting in urinary tract infections, also called pylenophritis (Holmgren, 1993). <P>

The pap pili consist of various proteins that perform different functions. For example, papA regulates the operation of the pilus, papF and papG are responsible for adhesion, and papE links the adhesin to the pilus. PapD, the protein described here, is responsible for the correct assembly of the sub-units comprising the pilus. Without this protein, the sub-units can be rapidly degraded by proteolytic enzymes (Holmgren, 1993). Proteolytic enzymes, also called proteinase, are a group of enzymes that break the long chain-like molecules of proteins into peptides and eventually into amino acids. <P>

The chaperone protein PapD is located in the space between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes of the E.coli bacterium. The protein has a mass of 24.5kD. Its primary structure consists of 218 molecules in the following sequence (Holmgren and Brändén, 1989). <P>

The three dimensional structure of papD has also been established by crystallographic techniques (Holmgren and Brändén, 1989). PapD consists of two "domains" (sheets consisting of several polypeptide strands) oriented towards each other at an angle which gives the molecule the overall shape of a boomerang. Each domain consists of two sets of anti-parallel pleated sheets (anti-parallel sheets are those in which the strands run in opposite directions), The first sheet consists of 3 strands and the lower consists of 4 strands. <P>

PapD has been found to be similar in appearance and overall structure to immunoglobulin, which is a large family of molecules involved in immune response, cell adhesion and other functions. It is thought that papD is evolutionally similar to these molecules (Holmgren et al., 1992). However, the mechanism by which papD performs its functions is not completely understood, and is still under investigation. <P>

Note: Pictures of the 3D structures of many proteins are stored in the Brookhaven National Labs Protein Database (PDB). Ribbon and space-fill diagrams for proteins can be viewed using a program called RASMOL. Look under http://www.pdb.bnl.gov  - instructions for downloading RASMOL are provided. You can then download the RASMOL file of the particular protein you want to view. <P>

	Renin is a proteolytic enzyme or may also be known as 
the angiotensin-forming enzyme.  Some expect that it can 
provide therapy for hypertension and congestive heart 
failure.  Angiotensin II (formed by renin) has been shown to 
control vascular tone, fluid volume, and sodium 
excretion.(Takahashi 159)  Renin occurs in the kidneys of 
several species (including mammalian) and in the 
submaxillary gland of mice.  Physically, the molecular 
weight of renin is 42,000.  It's isoelectric points in the 
range of 4.5-5.5 (multiple forms).  With the usual test 
substrate, renin is active when the pH is neutral or above.  
In 1972, renin was added to the Enzyme Nomenclature List 
having been assigned to class 3.4.99.(Barrett)<P>
	Renin occurs in membrane-bound organelles.  Cathepsin D 
(an intracellular enzyme that is active in weakly acidic 
solutions) and renin are very much alike.(Takahashi 181)  
They resemble each other in so many ways that there is 
speculation that they may be homologous structures; however, 
renin has a much narrower specificity.  This specificity 
must also be very high so that renin can convert 
angiotensinogen to angiotensin.(Barrett 233)<P>
	Many tests have been run to see how human renin 
compares to renin in mice.  A main difference on that front 
is that mice do not have N-glycosylated, while humans do.  
This is due to the fact that it is not essential to the 
activities of a mouse.(Takahashi 159)  Tests are still being 
run with renin and maybe scientists will be able to use it 
to help patients with hypertension and congestive heart 
failure.<P>

===message:	Next time you plan on drowning out your sorrows with a case of Southern Comfort, take a moment to reflect about the vital enzymes inside you that catalyze the transformation of alcohols into harmless compounds.  Without enzymes like alcohol dehydrogenase each drink of your favorite alcoholic beverage could do serious harm. <P>
	Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is a family of enzymes found in most organisms.  About 60% of the primary structures of the different ADH enzymes are the same(Yang et al, 1997).  In humans this enzyme is localized in the liver.  Alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes are coded by the genes ADH1 through ADH7 on the fourth chromosome(Yasunami et al, 1991).  The enzyme is responsible for metabolizing alcohol. It is very unspecific, however, and can also initiate oxidation-reduction reactions of aldehydes and ketones(http://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/fink/teaching/chem231/231-16.htm). <P>
	ADH is a dimer with molecular weight ~141,000.  The two subunits of some ADH enzymes are labeled E,for ethanol-active, and S, for steroid-active(http://www.worthington- biochem.com/manual/A/ADH.html).  Alcohol dehydrogenase is a metalloenzyme that contains two zinc (+2) atoms.  One zinc atom is the integral component of the active site of the enzyme, while the other is important in maintaining the structure of the protein (http://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/fink/teaching/chem231/231-16.htm).  The primary structure of most ADH enzymes is similar.  Here's the amino acid sequence of one ADH subunit, as an example: Met Ser Thr Ala Gly Lys Val Ile Lys Cys Lys Ala Ala Val Leu Trp Glu Val Lys Pro Phe Ser iile Cys ArgThr Asp His Val Ser Gly Asn Leu Val Thr Pro Leu Pro Val Lie Leu Gly His Glu Ala Ala Gly Lie Val Glu Ser Val Gly Glu Gly Val Thr Thr Val Lys Pro Gly Asp Lys Val Lie Pro Leu Phe Thr Pro Gln Cys Gly Lys Cys Arg Val Cys Lys Asn Pro Glu Ser Asn Tyr Cys Leu Lys Asn Asp Leu Gly Asn Pro Arg Gly Thr Leu Gln Asp Gly Thr Arg Arg Phe Thr Cys Arg Gly Lys Pro Lie His His Phe Leu Gly Thr Ser Thr Phe ser Gln Tyr Thr Val Val Asp Glu Asn Ala Val Ala Lys Lie Asp Ala Ala Ser Pro Leu Glu Lys Val Cys Leu Lie Gly Cys Gly Phe Ser Thr Gly Tyr Gly Ser Ala Val Asn Val Ala Lys Val Thr Pro Gly Ser Thr Cys Ala Val Phe Gly Leu Gly Gly Val Gly Leu Ser Ala Val Met Gly Cys Lys Ala Ala Gly Ala Ala Arg Lie Lie Ala Val Asp Lie Asn Lys Asp Lys Phe Ala Lys Ala Lys Lys Glu Leu Gly Ala Thr Glu Cys Lie Asn Pro Gln Asp Tyr Lys Lys Pro Lie Gln Glu Val Leu Lys Glyu Met Thr Asp Gly Gly Val Asp Phe Ser Phe Glu Val Lie Gly Arg Leu Asp Thr Met Met Ala Ser Leu Leu Cys Cys His Glu Ala Cys Gly Thr Ser Val Lie Val Gly Val Pro Pro Ala Ser Gln Asn Leu Ser Lie Asn Pro Met Leu Leu Leu Thr Gly Arg Thr Trp Lys Gly Ala Val Ala Asp Phe Met Ala Lys lys Phe ser Leu Asp Ala Leu Lie Thr His Val Leu Pro Phe Glu Lys Lie Asn Glu Gly Phe Asp Leu Leu His Ser Gly Lys Ser Lie Arg Thr Val Leu Thr Phe(Edenberg, et al. 1989). <P>
	Alcohol dehydrogenase uses a coenzymes NAD+.  Because of this, ADH has two substrates, which are compounds that lock into the active site of the enzyme.  The reaction begins with the binding of the first substrate, the coenzyme, into the active site.  This changes the shape of the active site, so an alcohol or an aldehyde can bind in.  With both substrates in place, the following reaction takes place: RCH2OH + NAD+   RCHO + NADH + H+ which can go either way, depending on the conditions of the reaction(http://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/fink/teaching/chem231/231-16.htm).  The product of the first reaction is an acetaldehyde, which is toxic.  Acetaldehyde is converted into acetic acid by another enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase(O'Keel, http://www.umsl.ed/~rkeel/180/etoh.html).  After the alcohol is converted into acetic acid, it does no harm to the body. <P>
	Interestingly, studies have shown that women produce less alcohol dehydrogenase than men.  Also, different ethnic groups have been shown to produce different varieties of ADH( These studies help explain why women and some ethnic groups have a lower than average tolerance for alcohol. <P>

===message:Hemoglobin<P>Hemoglobin is a protein that you, I, and every other vertebrate on the planet rely on every time we take a breath.  Your pet dog, cat, goldfish, and ferret all have hemoglobin.  Most people know that the function of red blood cells is to carry oxygen from the lungs to every other organ and tissue in the body.  On their journey back to the lungs from the organs, the red cells carry carbon dioxide to the be expelled by the lungs.<P>The way these blood cells do this is through the carrier, a protein called hemoglobin.  Hemoglobin performs its tasks by binding molecules of oxygen at the lungs and carrying these molecules to the body’s tissues.  On its return trip, it binds the carbon dioxide to be hauled to the lungs.<P>Not only is hemoglobin one of the most important proteins in vertebrates, it is also one of the most plentiful.  For example, an average milliliter of blood has approximately 5 billion red cells.  Each red cell has around 250 million hemoglobin molecules.1  So each milliliter of blood has around 1.25 X 1018 molecules of hemoglobin.  For some perspective, if hemoglobin were the size of marbles (they’re not), a quantity of around one gallon of blood would contain enough hemoglobin to blanket the planet in a layer three feet thick.<P>As noted, hemoglobin molecules are not the size of marbles.  While they are significantly larger than water molecules, they are still very small in the overall scheme of things.  It takes 9.3 X 1018 molecules of hemoglobin to equal one gram.<P>As with all proteins, hemoglobin’s primary structure consists of a unique sequence of amino acids.  In fact, hemoglobin’s structure varies from animal to animal.  For example, the number of amino acid differences in the Beta chain between a human and a gorilla is one2.  The human hemoglobin molecule is a globular protein with a total of four chains, two identical chains labeled alpha with 141 amino acids and two identical chains labeled Beta with 146 amino acids.3  Hemoglobin’s primary structure is shown in Table 1.<P>A final note of interest is that if hemoglobin’s primary structure is changed by substituting a single amino acid, the result will be a disease called sickle cell disease.  The abnormal hemoglobin molecules tend to link together and crystallize, deforming the cells into a sickle shape.  These deformed cells will clog tiny blood vessels, impeding blood flow and causing serious medical problems.<P>Table 1.

===subject:A new WNT inhibitor, Dickkopf-1
===message: 	A little more than a year ago the Sunday Times of London published a story about headless tadpoles. The media latched onto one man’s claim that human versions of these creatures could be used in the future. A former director of of the National Institutes of Health was quoted on the CBS Evening News  as saying  that headless ‘organ sacks’ “have zero potential to say no.”(Zorpette,1998)  All of this hyped attention drew away from the true meaning of the work, gene expression in embryonic development. <P> 

	According to Jan. 24 Science News and Jan. 22 Nature,  a team of researchers headed by Christof Niehrs of the Duetsches Krebforschungszentrum in Hiendberg discovered the protein Dickkoph-1 while studying  Xenopus Laevis  frogs. Dickkopf-1 is part of the developmental system in embryos that controls the size of their heads, or sometimes the lack of.  While many researches have identified WNT and BMP inhibitors this team found another WNT inhibiter. Dicktopf-1 acts to keep the size of the head proportional to the body. When an excess of Dicktopf-1 is present an embryo can develop  two heads, but when  Dickkopf-1 is inhibited by antibodies, the heads of affected embryos fail to grow  or they are extremely small if a head even does exist. Dickkopf-1 remains active all through the frogs life. This implies mitotic ties in later development.  Dickkopf-1 could also be used as a cancer suppressor once it’s function in a adult organisms is further understood.  While this is a frog protein, it is probable lower organisms and humans possess a similar protein  only waiting to be found.<P>

===message:When a foreign invader such as a bacteria or virus attack the human body, a complex series of events takes place in defense.  There exist two different strategies of counter attack.  One of these strategies is the cellular (or cell-mediated) immunity response.  The other is the humoral (or antibody-mediated) immunity (Donnelly, 583).   At the core of humoral immunity defense is immunoglobulin.  <P>

Immunoglobulins (abbreviated, Ig) are part of the immune system, and can be found anywhere in the human body. B cells in the human immune system are produced in the spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow (Tizard, 155). When these B cells are stimulated, they develop into plasma cells which produce and secrete immunoglobulins (Martini, 585). The Igs themselves don't kill the invading bodies, the proteins only act as identifiers, tagging the antigens. Then macrophages and neutrophils can locate the antigens and phagocytose the antigens. Immunoglobulins are also present on the membrane of the B cells. These Igs are receptors. They combine with antigens and stimulate the B cells to produce and secrete more of the Igs necessary to fight these antigens (Fox, 432). <P>

There are 5 different classes of immunoglobulins (Ig): IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM (Kuby, 273).  Each different class has a specialized chemical structure, specific to that class.  All Ig molecules are basically Y shaped. They consist of four interconnected polypeptide chains, two long, heavy (H) chains and 2 shorter, lighter (L) chains (Fox, 431).  Although they are similar, each immunoglobulin is distinct from the others in both form and function. For example, IgG is most abundant in the blood and lymph (Dellman, 198). It is also the smallest of the Igs, that gives it the ability to escape from blood vessels (Tizard, 154). <P>

===message:Hemoglobin is an oxygen-carrying protein in erythrocytes made of one globin, a polypeptide chain, and four heme.  The function of hemoglobin is not limited to the carrying of oxygen to the tissues of the body, but also includes carbon dioxide transport through the blood, buffering of the blood, and prevention of harmful pH changes within the blood (Rhoades).  Hemoglobin is found in all vertabrates, and most other organisms which possess a circulatory system, such as the phylum Nemertea (Rhoades).  This piece will focus on hemoglobin found in mammalian species.<P>
	Hemoglobin is composed of four heme units, each containing iron in the center.  The iron center is the location of the oxygen binding.  Each heme is able to carry a single oxygen molecule, allowing every hemoglobin to carry a total of four oxygen molecules (1.34 mL)(Ingram, 1963).  The four heme units have a cooperative relationship, when one heme binds to an oxygen molecule the other three change shape slightly, increasing their affinity for oxygen.  In the same way when one heme releases its oxygen molecule the affinity for oxygen of the other molecules is decreased, causing them to release their oxygen as well (Ingram, 1961).<P>
	Hemoglobin also conatins a single protein molecule called globin.  This is a globular protien with a quaternary structure, which contains two types of polypeptide chains (Rhoades).  Different variations of globinare present at different stages in life.  Embryonic and fetal forms have a higher affinity for oxygen than those found in adult blood.  This insures that a fetus is receiving a sufficient amount of axygen from its mother.  Blood within a fetus also contains about 20% more hemoglobin than an adults blood (Ingram, 1963).<P>
	Hemoglobin may take on two general forms, oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) or deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) (Rhoades).  Oxyhemoglobin is oxygen saturated, bright red in color and found in the arteries of the body.  Deoxyhemoglobin lacks oxygen, is reddish-blue in color, and is found in veins of the body.  Together these hemoglobin work with in the circulatory system to supply the bodies tissues with sufficient oxygen from the lungs.<P>

===message:
     The protein actin helps to change the body's energy into mechanical work.  ATP is an essential part of the actin molecule.  Muscle myofibrils are made up, partially, of actin which joins meromyosin to produce actomyosin that is very viscous.  Actin works very closely with myosin, activating it at a small ionic strength.  It also polymerizes-causes a decrease in viscosity-by adding ATP at a high ionic strength.  F-actin, from which actin is reversibly changed, is made by adding some neutral salts at a slightly basic or neutral pH.  Actin is vital for studies that monitor cell motion and transport.

===message:	Aging is a hot topic these days.  Much research is being done on aging- what causes it, how it happens, how we can slow or stop it.  Researchers at Brown University may have made a major discovery in this area.(Nature Science Update, November 5, 1997)<P>  
	According to Nature  magazine, a protein called hsp70 been has shown to have a direct affect on aging in flies and round worms in a laboratory environment.  Hsp70, a heat-shock protein, is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells.  Hsp70 is a chaperone protein.  A chaperone protein’s main function is to promote the proper folding and shaping of other proteins during various processes.  Exposure to heat or cold can damage the proteins' structures, thereby affecting its function.  Heat-shock proteins like hsp70 are believed to combat this stress related damage.  Nearly all living organisms have some form of a chaperone protein for this reason.<P>  
	Researchers at the University of Minnesota led by assistant professor of evolutionary biology and ecology Marc Tatar have exposed flies and types of roundworms to short doses of extra heat.  This exposure caused the organisms to produce larger quantities of hsp70.  The off-spring of these organisms that contained extra copies of the hsp70 gene responded to heat by producing large amounts of hsp70.  These flies and round worms had life spans increased by almost two weeks.<P>  
	Hsp70 levels are very closely monitored by the cells that produce them, making extended life in humans by exposure to heat very unlikely.  More research is being done on the affects of proteins like hsp70.<P>
	Hsp70 is made of 70 amino acid building blocks.  The following is the amino acid sequence of hsp70:<P>

===message:    Hemoglobin is a protein that is contained entirely in the red blood cells, totaling about 35% of their weight.  It is the most prevalent of the special blood pigments that transport oxygen; it is present in all but the least complex of animals.  Its participates in the process by which blood carries required nutrients to the cells and transports their waste products to the excretory organs. Hemoglobin also carries oxygen from the lungs or gills, where blood is oxygenated, to body cells.  When saturated with oxygen, it is call oxyhemoglobin.  After hemoglobin releases oxygen to the body tissues, it reverses its function and picks up carbon dioxide, the principle product of tissue respiration, for transport to the lungs, where it is expired.  In this form it is known as carboxyhemoglobin.  <P>
     To combine properly with oxygen the red blood cells must contain adequate hemoglobin; this in turn depends on the about of iron in the body.  The organism derives its store of iron by absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The organism conserves and constantly reuses the supply of iron.  A deficiency of hemoglobin caused by a lack of iron leads to anemia. <P>
	Hemoglobin carries more than 20 times its volume of oxygen.  It also combines so firmly with carbon monoxide that it can no longer combine with oxygen; this causes asphyxiation.  After a life of around 120 days, red blood cells are destroyed in the spleen or, in the course of circulation, their hemoglobin is broken into its constituents, including iron, which enters new blood cells formed in the bone marrow.  When blood vessels rupture, as in an injury, the red cells are released and escape into tissue, where they are broken down.  The hemoglobin is converted into bile pigments, the color that is responsible for the appearance of bruises.  <P>

===subject:Protein Assignment-Fibrinogen
===message:	Fibrinogen is a large soluble protein present in blood plasma.  It1s role is to protect the body from damage following tissue injury.  this is called the thrombotic process.  Fibrinogen is a disulfide-crosslinked dimer or heterotrimers, and contains two copies each of the alpha, beta, and gamma chains.  The fibrinogen content of blood plasma is 0.2-0.4.<P>
	If an injury happens to a vessel wall then thrombin will be activated which results in a soluble fibrinogen molecule converted into a insoluble fibrin.  This reaction, with the presence of the clotting factor VIII, results with a good clot at injury.  Fibrinogen also plays a important role in aggregation of platelets at injury site.  It reacts along with the receptor protein on the platelet resulting in platelet aggregation.  This forms a stable clot and minimizes damage and blood loss.  Fibrinogen is also tied in with the inflammatory process.  When fibrinogen is activated along with other acute-phase proteins during inflammation results with increased plasma viscosity.  The increase of RBC aggregation prevents further damage at the inflamed site.( Meade TW, Imeson J, Stirling Y, 1997)<P>

	There are many diseases in which fibrinogen is associated with such as a myocardial infarction (MI).  The fibrinogen levels increase during and after a MI and because of the increase of fibrinogen, myocardial necrosis (tissue death) occurs following an MI.  Also with a stroke, some patients have shown an increase of the fibrinogen level.  In peripheral artery disease, the measurement of the plasma fibrinogen is used to screen for a symptomatic early stages in this disease.  A patient with hypertension has a slightly higher fibrinogen level.  A person with diabetes has an increase fibrinogen level.  Someone who decides to smoke also puts influence on the levels of fibrinogen.  In healthy individuals, smoking increases the levels of fibrinogen in a dose-dependant manner, the effect being reversible on cessation.  Your age also affects the fibrinogen level, the older you are the higher the fibrinogen level becomes.  Your lifestyle also depends on how high or low you want to have your fibrinogen levels to be, such as having a healthy diet, exercise, moderate alcohol intake will lower the fibrinogen levels in your body.( Br Heart J 1993)<P>

	To reduce the plasma fibrinogen level it would also lower the risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular risk, and cardiovascular death.( J Roy Coll Gen Pract 1985)  There are lipid-alterating drugs that can help lower the fibrinogen level.  Some fibrates, eg, bezafibrate, can lower plasma fibrinogen levels by 10-20 percent.  Clinical trials have shown that lipid-alterating agents such as bezafibrate, significantly reduce plasma fibrinogen levels after a few weeks of treatment.  It appears that bezafibrate reduce fibrinogen synthesis, thereby lowering fibrinogen levels and causing a decrease in the activation of the coagulation system.( Munich: MMV Medizan Verlag, 1993)<P>

	The general consensus is that raised fibrinogen levels are a predictor of cardiovascular disease and should be considered a major independent risk factor.  Thus, lowering fibrinogen levels helps to reduce the risks of arterial disease.( J Roy Coll Gen Pract 1985)<P>

===message:Bacteriorhodopsin is a relatively small, trans-membrane protein, found in the cellularmembrane of Halobacterium salinarium.  This Organism, also known as Halobacteriumhalobium, is a member of the archaea. <p> 	Halobacterium salinarium is considered to be a species of extremely halophilicarchaea(Brock et al., 1994).  Halobacterium salinarium is naturally found in areas withhigh salt concentrations, like salt pans and natural salt lakes.  Bacteriorhodopsin is locatedwithin the bilayer boundary of Halobacterium salinarium, in what are termed purplepatches, these purple patches are tightly packed two-dimensional crystals (Pebay-Peyroulaet al., 1997). <p>  	Bacteriorhodopsin transfers protons from the interior of the bacterial cell, to theoutside in a cyclic process.  This proton current is then used to to generate ATPmolecules.  The proton pumping mechanism of bR is powered by light, and this lightenergy is used to generate chemical energy for the bacterium; thus bR acts as aphotosynthetic protein (Brock et al., 1994). <p>   	Bacteriorhodopsin gathers its light energy by a special molecule called retinal. Retinal binds to a specific amino acid in bR after the protein has been initially created andincorporated into the cell membrane(Brock et al., 1994).  Retinal is used in several otherproteins to harvest light, it is part of the rhodopsin family of proteins.  This includesrhodopsin, rhodopsin is found in the visual pigments of our eyes, and acts to help regulateour sensitivity to light (Brock et al., 1994). <p>   	 Bacteriorhodopsin consists of seven membrane spanning alpha helixes, these areconnected by three external, and three cytoplasmic loops(Pebay-Peyroula et al., 1997). The retinal is bound via the terminal NH2 group of lysine216 in a Schiff’s base linkage.  Itmakes contact with six of the seven amino acid side chains (Alan.Ward@ncl.ac.uk).  Theretinal chromophore of bacteriorhodopsin normally exists in an all-trans configuration. When it absorbs light it is excited and temporarily converted to the 13-cisformation(Brock et al., 1994).

===message:Cyclin is a protein that regulates the way that proteins function as molecular clocks that pace sequential events of the cell cycle.  Cyclins help to regulate this when they are attached to protein kinases, enzymes that control the activities of other proteins.  


A protein kinase is only active when it is attached to a cyclin.  Therefore, they are called cyclin-dependent kinases, or Cdks.  Throughout the cycle, a Cdk is around equally, but it's activity in targeting proteins rises and falls when changes occur in the concentration of its cyclin component.  


During the cells cycle, cyclin is synthesized and finally accumulates during interphase.  It then attaches itself to the Cdk, so then the protein complex is activated at the end of interphase.  Then, the active complex, MPF, coordinates mitosis by phosphorylating various proteins, including other protein kinases.  Finally, the Cdk component of the MPF is recycled, its kinase activity restored by association with new cyclin that accumulates during interphase.

===message:Protein Report: DNA Polymerase<p>
by Dawn Spiller<P>
	DNA polymerase is the enzyme that helps in the replication of DNA when cells divide.  DNA replication is aided by a lot of enzymes and other proteins.  Replication begins at special sites on the DNA molecule when the cell is about to divide.  Proteins that initiate replication attach to this site and start to unzip the DNA strand.  At this point a replication fork is made where the new strands of DNA are made.  The making of new DNA is catalyzed by the DNA polymerase.  The nucleotides align with the old strand, one by one the polymerase adds them to the new DNA strand.  Polymerase can not work alone.  The DNA molecule has one leading strand, ending with a 3' carbon, and a lagging strand ending with a 5' carbon.  DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides from a free 3' spot.  The polymerase makes Okazaki fragments instead of one big strand from the lagging strand.  DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments into one big strand.  Another restriction is that polymerase can not initiate the synthesis of DNA, another enzyme, primase, must do that.<p>
	Polymerase is an enzyme.  An enzyme can be made up of two or more proteins interlocked.  Enzymes catalyze reactions, in this case polymerase catalyzes the reaction of the hydrolysis of the bonds between the phosphate groups.   The reaction takes place at the active site of the polymerase.  The primary structure of DNA polymerase for bacteriophage is:
A A M D K E H P D H S K Y K D D K F I A V C K D L D N V K R I L G A.  DNA polymerase is found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.   Polymerase is synthesized in the cell.<p>

===message:	Collagen the most abundant protein in mammals, represents from one fourth to one third the total protein in the human body.  It accounts for over 70% of the dry weight of skin, and is the major protein component in tendon, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, and teeth.  In each of these instances, collagen serves as an extracellular(outside of cells) supporting element.(Ritter,1996)<P>

	This extracellular supporting element or extracellular matrix(ECM) is made up of strong collagen fibers.(Campbel,1996)  These collagen fibers influence the textural quality of muscle/meat that is consumed by carnivorous humans.(Charley and Weaver,1998)  In other words the more collagen you have in your piece of meat the less tender it will be, which shows how physically strong the collagen can be.<P>

	Because of collagen’s physical/supporting role to the cells, it needs to be physically strong, water insoluble, and relatively resistant to chemical change.(Ritter,1996)  Which leads us to the structure of the collagen protein.  The basic building blocks for all collagen molecules are polypeptides containing around 1000 amino acid residues.  These polypeptides contain some uncommon amino acids along with the 20 common amino acids.  The uncommon ones, including 4-hydroxyproline(Hyp) and 5-hydroxylysine(Hyl) are produced through the enzyme catalyzed modification of particular common amino acids after they have been incorporated into the polymer chains.(Ritter,1996)  Glycine, hydroxyproline, proline, alanine, glutamic acid, and arginine account for approximately 33%, 21%, 10%, 5% and 5% respectively, of all amino acid residues in a typical collagen polypeptide.(Ritter,1996)  Every third of these amino acids is usually glycine, and the sequence Gly-Pro-Hyp recurs many times.  This unique primary structure causes most collagen polypeptides to twist into extended left handed helices.  Three such helices then wrap together to give a right handed coil known as a superhelix or triple helix.  Hydrophobic interactions and H bonds are the predominant forces that hold the polypeptide chains together within the super helix.(Ritter, 1996)<P>

===message:Immunoglobulins<P>

	Immunoglobulins or antibodies, are proteins which recognize and help eliminate viruses, bacteria, and other foreign matter in mammalian type animals and humans.  Immunoglobulins consist of cells of the immune system called B lymphocytes--a type of white blood cell.  These B lymphocytes are very specialized, producing one specific type of antibody to attack a specific invader (Campbell 362-363).  Thus immunoglobulins have two functions in a living animal:  bond with foreign molecules or antigens and to eliminate the threatening antigens to its host (McCraw-Hill 43).<P>

	An immunoglobulin has a unique shape.  A typical antibody is a y-shaped molecule that is held by four polypeptide chains--two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains.  Both heavy and light chains vary in amino acid sequence, called the constraint regions.  The types of constant regions determine the five major types of immunoglobulins: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE.  The tips of the y-shaped molecule is called the variable regions of the heavy and light chains.  This is where the immunoglobulins bind with the antigen.  In the region of the antigen-binding site, several weak bonds form chemical groups called eptiopes to determine the antigen.  The tail end of the immunoglobulin consist of constant regions of polypeptide chains and contains the mechanism which to inactivate the antigen (Campbell 863).<P>

	There are five main immunoglobulins located in various places of humans and mammals.  IgG, IgM, and IgD immunoglobulins are present in normal blood.  This accounts for most of all immunoglobulins.  IgA represent about fifteen to twenty percent of immunoglobulins.  They are found in various secretions of mucous (respiratory and digestive), saliva, milk, tears, and fluids secreted into the genital-urinary and digestive tracts.  IgD immunoglobulins are present in plasma membranes of many circulating B lymphocytes.  IgE immunoglobulins reside on surfaces of basophils and mast cells of connective tissue (Strack).<P>

	Amino acid sequences vary extensively in each antibody due to the different invaders (Campbell 863).  IgG is however the most common type of immunoglobulin (Strack).<P>

	Hemoglobin is an oxygen-carrying protein that contains iron. The hemoglobin molecules are present in the red blood cells, and bind with oxygen or carbon dioxide to transport them through the organism.   As red blood cells pass through the capillaries of the lungs, or gills, or other respiratory organs, oxygen diffuses into the erythrocytes and hemoglobin binds the oxygen. There are two polypeptide subunits of hemoglobin, alpha and beta. One family, located on the 16th chromosome in humans, encodes different versions of the alpha globin. The beta globin is encoded on the 11th chromosme. The different versions of each globin subunit are expressed at different times of development, allowing the hemoglobin a variety of functions throughout the changing body of a developing organism. (Campbell, 1996)<P>
	Hemoglobin is composed of four different proteins, two alpha and two beta chains. In the center of each folded chain, there is a heme group that functions to bind the oxygen or carbon dioxide. The heme unit is a nonpolypeptide component with an iron atom. ( Campbell, 1996)<P>
	Hemoglobin is present in a wide variety of organisms, from the South American lungfish to chimpanzees to humans. (Web Source)<P>  
	Hemoglobin is responsible for the coloring of blood. When the blood is fully oxygenated, it is bright red. As the oxygen is depleted from the red blood cells, it turns to a more purplish color. At this point, the hemoglobin is bound to carbon dioxide, which it returns to the respiratory organ to exchange for more oxygen. (Marieb, 1998)<P>
	The main reason why carbon monoxide is so deadly is due to the fact that it binds irreversibly with the hemoglobin protein, disabling it from binding with either oxygen or carbon dioxide. This results in a slow suffocation, as carbon dioxide accumulates in the body, and can't be removed. A blood transfusion is the quickest way to add more hemoglobin to the organism to replace the damaged ones. (Marieb, 1998)<P>

	Alfred Pischinger, a Viennese histologist in the 1930s, studied the collagen mesh system. This extracellular matrix was found to be the center of a multitude of processes such as a location for "mast cells" to release histamines in inflammatory process, or fibroblasts that continually rebuild fibers in the mesh whenever the body suffers an injury of some kind.  Toxins are constantly being dumped in the matrix temporarily, and therefore needs regular flushing with fresh water.  Pischinger found that synthetic drugs "invariably cause a damaging shock reaction" to the body's extracellular matrix of collagens. Some research theories were developed (Horn 1990) about tendencies for some of the public to be "overweight and fatigued". It is thought that perhaps L- hydroxyproline (a major component of collagen) is deficient in the body. Since it is derived from Arginine, it is known that the body synthesizes arginine, but never quite enough for our needs ( Horn 1990).  As yet, little is known about the effect of L-hydroxyproline treatments. However, the results that exist are positive, i.e., improvement with obesity, joint pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, diabetics, congestive heart failure, and fatigue.

===subject:Blood is thicker than Sugar
===message:     Protiens serve several important roles in the human body.  These long chains of amino acids transport oxygen, store iron, and conrtol reactioms.  The human body creates hormone to control the body, and these hormones are proteins.<p>
    
 Insulin is one of the most well known hormones.  51 different amino acids divided into two chains form insulin (Armstrong 89). Insulin helps lower the blood  sugar level in the body.  Since the body has a way to lower the blood glucose level, it must also have a way to lower it.  Glucagon is used to increase the blood sugar level.  These two hormones together are used to maintain homeostatsis the blood sugar concentration, but how do these proteins achieve that?<p>
    
 Homeostasis is how the body maintains the proper condition for it to work. An example is the heart beating faster when a person exercises so more oxygen can be passed throughout the body.  Inuslin forms a cycle in an attempt to  maintain an equilibrium.  After eating a meal, a person will have a high blood glucose level.  The excessive amount of sugar in the bloodstream will cause the beta cells in the pancreas to release insulin (Campbel 96).  The insulin stimulates the liver to store glucose by turning it to glycogen.  Insulin also convinces body cells to take in mor glucose.  The blood sugar level decreases, and insulin release diminshes.<p>
   
 If a person doesn't eat for a while, The blood glucose level will decrease.  When it reaches the activaton point, Alpha cells in the pancreas will release glucagon.  Once the glucagon reaches the liver, the liver will transfer glycogen back into glucose. The blood sugar rises, and homeostasis is maintained.<p>
     
 When something goes wrong with this mechanism, a disorder known as diabetes occurs.  Diabetes is when the body fails to lower the amount of glucose in the blood.  It is so bad that some diabetics urinate sugar.   Diabetes comes in two forms, Type I and II diabetes mellitus (Campbell 96).  Type I is an auto immune diorder where the imune system attcks the pancreas (Campbell 96).  Type II is caused by a lack of reponsiveness by the cells in the pancreas.  There is no real cure foe either, but by taking the victims of these disorders can live normal lives.<p>
     
 This maybe one of the lesser known processes for homeostatsis, but is still important.  Without insulin and glucagon, most humans would live their lives in great discomfort.<p>

===subject:Hemoglobin
===message:The hemoglobin molecule is located in the bloodstream of all oxygen breathing creatures.  It consists of the protein “globin”, and a brownish-red pigment called “heme”.  The hemoglobin molecule is located on the red blood cells (RBC’s).   Hemoglobin makes up approximately 33% of the total RBC weight. (Torta, 1986.)  There are around 280 million molecules of hemoglobin per eurethrocyte. (Torta, 1986.) 
<p>
Hemoglobin is a globular structure that transports oxygen to the cells, and waste gases, such as carbon dioxide, away from the cells. The bright red color that we associate with blood, is actually caused by the oxyhemoglobin, and the bluish-red  color we sometimes see with blood is caused by deoxyhemoglobin.  The normal amounts of hemoglobin in the body are as follows:  14-20gm/100mL of blood in infants; 12-15gm/100mL in adult females; and 14-16.5gm/100mL of blood in adult males. (Torta, 1986.)
<p>
Globin consists of four polypeptide chains- two alpha chains, and two beta chains. (Marieb, 1995.)  Each of these is bound to a heme group containing a single atom of iron.  (Marieb, 1995.)  Each molecule of hemoglobin can transport four molecules of oxygen. (Parker-Anthony, Thibodeau, 1983.)

Protein: Pepsin <P>

Pepsin is an enzyme protein found in the gastric juices of the stomach of humans .  It's function is to hydrolyze proteins as a part of the digestion process, however, hydrolysis is incomplete because pepsin can only break peptide bonds adjacent to specific amino acids.  Pepsin's action cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides.  It is one of the few enzymes that works best in a strongly acidic environment.  The low pH of gastric juice denatures the proteins in the food which enters the stomach, thereby 
increasing the exposure of their peptide bonds to the pepsin.  (Campbell, 1996) <P>

Pepsin is secreted by the chief cells of the stomach wall in an inactive precursor form known as pepsinogen. (Vander, et al; 1994).  Hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice of the stomach converts pepsinogen to the active pepsin by removing a short segment of the protein's polypeptide chain, an alteration that exposes the active site of pepsin. Because the acid and the pepsinogen ore secreted by different kinds of cells, the two ingredients do not mix until they are released into the lumen of the stomach.  This process is what prevents pepsin from destroying the very cells which synthesize it. Once some of the pepsinogen is activated by acid, a chain reaction occurs because pepsin itself can activate additional molecules of pepsinogen.   This domino 
effect is known as positive feedback and pepsin represents just one example of a protein digesting enzyme which is secreted in an inactive form.  These types of enzymes are generally called zymogens (Campbell, 1996). <P>

Pepsin is only active in the presence of a high hydrogen ion concentration.  It becomes inactive when it enters the small intestine, where the hydrogen ions are neutralized by the bicarbonate ions secreted into the small intestine (Vander, et al; 1994). <P>

Pepsin is not essential for protein digestion since, in its absence, protein can be completely digested by enzymes in the small intestine (Vander, et al; 1994).  However, the importance of protein digestion does not lie so much in its contribution to the breakdown of ingested macromolecules, but rather in the generation of peptides and amino acids that act as stimulants for cholecystokinin release in the duodenum.  The gastric peptides, therefore, are instrumental in the initiation of the pancreatic phase of protein digestion (Devlin; 1982). <P>

Myosin is one of the major proteins of the contractile apparatus of muscle cells.  Myosin provides, through ATP hydrolysis, the energy required for muscle contraction (Taylor, 1979).  Rabbit muscle myosin is composed of 2 heavy chains (molecular weight 200,000) and 4 light chains (molecular weight 15,000-30,000) (Margossian, 1982).  Myosin also shows close associatian with the actin filaments.  In the muscle cell, myosin makes up the thick bands, and actin makes up the thin filaments.  It is the relative gliding of the of the actin and myosin bands that brings about muscle contraction (Beastie, 1998).<P>

Here are the specifications of Myosin.  Its purity is predominately heavy and light chains by SDS-PAGE.  When you ship it for next day delivery it needs to be packed in ice and stored at -20 degrees Celcius.  The protein concentration is >20 ml/ml.  And the protein is supplied in 10 mM TES, the pH is 7.0, and it is stable for at least 12 months when stored properly. (Taylor, 1979).<P>

The structure of myosin is made up of three polysaccharide branches which is a complex arrangement of glucose units (Campbell, 1998).<P>
