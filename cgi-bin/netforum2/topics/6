===message:No.  English is not a universal language, and it won't be in the near future.  English is probably the most popular language.  This's especially true for international business, politics and even academia.  But as long as we can still survive without learning a single word of English, its role is to be identified.  I believe it's the culture that's associated with English which builds up the confusion.  People in some of the non-English speaking countries might recognize the golden arch and the M-c-D-O-N-A-L-D as the symbol of fast food but not knowing that it's an imported English word.
And it appears that as the world is becoming a global market place, the needs for learning English seem to go the other way.  People are trading e-mails and information in their own language around the world as the software companies are developing language kits for different users.  Companies spend enormous amount of money and effort trying to relate to the consumers with their own culture and languages.  
But if there's ever a universal language, all other languages will come in a distant second to English.
By the way, you won't understand a thing if you go to Korea and watch an episode of Baywatch.  Pamela Lee suddenly speaks Korean.  Or may be not.

===message:I really don't know to much about other countries and the way they live, but in my own opinion I feel english is universal to some extent.  But I also feel America is also, like how people like American cloths, 
 Coca- Cola, and the music.  I feel that this is sort of universal to some extent, because no matter where you look these symbols seem to be everywhere.
