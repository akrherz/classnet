===message:What is an American?  Better yet, what is a Latin American?  It was bothered me, when I was in Europe, that everybody refered to the people from the United States as Americans.  People from Mexico were always thought of as Mexicans, and people from Canada as Canadiens.  Perhaps it's because United Staters or United Statish just don't sound good at all.  And Latin Americans just weren't really thought of much at all.

===message:Webster defines an American (n) in 3 ways: an Indian of No. or So. America, a native or inhabitant of No. or So. America, or  a citizen of the U.S.. I think for modern times, U.S. inhabitants have come to be "Americans" as a simplification. It wouldn't make sense to refer to us as United Statesians (in reference to Mr. Wood's comment), for that is more of a description of our situation than a proper name. If you don't want to be referred to as an American, what do you want to be referred to as, Iowan? As far as the question "what is an American" is concerned, I think it really depends on the context of the usage. Language can be a tricky thing. For our time, the word "American" can probably be taken to mean all things associated with the U.S.. Also, I think the term "Latin American" can be somewhat ambiguous. Some would take that to mean Latino living in America (U.S.) whereas others would interpret it as an inhabitant of the region we refer to as  Latin America. Then again, can Latin America be ambiguous in the same way?  Once again, language is tricky. In the era of all the p.c. balony, one has to be careful.

===message:I think that the term "American" ought to be used to describe anyone who considers their home to be North, South, or Central America.  Even though there is great contrast in the languages, cultures, economies, and governments of all the countries that make up the Americas, we all have common histories.  Certain aspects of these histories are nothing to be proud of, but they all define what "American" means.  It means a mixture of Native Americans, Europeans, Africans, and immigrants from all around the world living together as Americans while often maintaining their own strong ties to their ancestry.  America is a young area of the world that is filled with people with many ancient nationalities.  The differnces in people sometimes cause conflict, but this diversity also makes for a unique mixture of people.  And that in itself is a culture.  American culture.

===message:Well, speaking on a global level, all those living in Central, South, and North America would technically be considered Americans.  Since we as the United States occupy much of North America and because we as a country take so much pride in having the unique history we do, Americans has taken to mean United States citizens only for much of the world.  I personally have no idea if a man in Argentina, or El Salvador, or Canada would consider himself an American.  Considering some of the negative feelings abroad about Americans and American culture, it would almost be a surprise that anyone would want to claim him or herself as an American.  Ask three different people around this hemisphere who they would define as Americans and one would probably get three completely different answers.

===message:In light of our class discussion today regarding diversity, I found the following quote on the "Friends of Free Markets" home page to be of interest.  John Stuart Mill stated the following in his 1848 book:
	"The economical benefits of commerce are surpassed by those of its effects which are intellectual and moral.  It is hardly possible to overrate the value, for the improvement of human beings, of things which bring them into contact with persons dissimilar to themselves, and with modes of thought and action unlike those with which they are familiar... it is indispensable to be perpetually comparing (one's) own notions and customs with the experience and example of persons in different... there is no nation which does not need to borrow from others."
America has certainly followed this advice to the letter; diversity in America is a source of innovative collaborations.

===message:NOt to be big headed but on this subject all I know is that I am an American.  There is a slight distinction between Amercans and all other people in the world.  But, not to get tangled up in English, everyone in the world knows who an American is.  My grandmother is mexican she is from Mexico.  My grandfather is African-American because his ethnic background is from Africa but he was born here, worked here and raised a family here so he is also an American.  One final note, my mother is an American, she was in Vietnam and has lived all over Europe, she is as American as green tomato pie.  It does't matter to me what connotation goes with being an American I wouldn't want to be called anything else.  PS:  To all those people who have a problem with being called an American well...you could always be a Canadian!: )

===message:This is really interesting topic.  Everytime I heard the 
word "America" in the media it all seem to relate to North
America only.  There are also Central America and South America
that everyone seem to forget that is America too.  I wonder 
if the people who lived in Central America or South America
called themself an American.  For Example in Canada, do
they called themself American or Canadian.  The word America 
is confusing.  Everytime the word "America" is use, it 
always refered to North America only and period.

===message:I'm an American.  My dad is 100%Dutch but my mom is German, Swedish, Swiss, Dutch, Indian, and distant African American.  We all have some type of goofy mixture but your real nationality is from what you sing the National Anthem to, what flag you salute, and basically where you hang your heart.  I am an American.  My nationalism is very strong. I have many friends from other countries and whether I am right or wrong I defend my country to them.  An American is brave, and free.  An American knows what they are proud of.  An American won't admit when we are wrong.  An American is anybody who wishes to live in America over all else.  Most of all, an American is what you say when someone asks you what nationality you are and you answer proudly, what?  "I'm an American."
