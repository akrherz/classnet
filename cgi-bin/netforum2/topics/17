===more:About two years ago, in California, the state government came up with legislation called prop 187.  This bill dealt with health care for illegal aliens going to hospitals in the U.S.  Health care is or was provided for persons brought in and payed for by the tax payers.  If these persons seeking medical attention are in the U.S. illegally, should they be admitted or turned away?  Why should tax payers fit the medical bills for people that are not supposed to be in the United States in the first place?  Now you are dealing with a moral issue that says, hospitals should take care of them because they are humanbeings.

===message:I'm for prop 187, because as a legal immgration I myself do not receive a free medical care and I work and pay taxes.  What do those illegal immgration contribute.  Look at California economies.  It's pretty bad and they are losing one billion dollar annually.  We all know that if the county or state does not have financially to do anything that country or state is not going to be successful and the economy go down as well.  Now you just witness what happen to California.  The state economic is bad and now you see lots of illegal immgration are moving to midwest and east cost to look for jobs.  This than will have the effect on the economy for the midwest and east coast.

===message:I am against Proposition 187.  This proposition could very well be considered cruel and unusual!  A major part of the proposition has to do with taking kids of illegal immigrants out of school and taking away their medical services.  Kids should not have to be the pawns of politics, and nor should their health be put to risk.  Migration of species has taken place for millions of years. So the present day migration of people should not be subject of scapegoating and political persecution.  The politicians who are making decisions should keep in mind their own ancestory of migration.  The opportunities and freedom that this 'Nation-State' has offered to the immigrants of the past should be preserved for the current and future immigrants to this land.
