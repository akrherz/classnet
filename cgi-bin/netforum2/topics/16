===more:Over the course of this class, it seems to me one sad theme keeps re-emerging.  The main root cause of most of the Other World's problems is poverty.  Yes, cultural differences do play a big role in the ability to get along, but I truly believe that if economic opportunity exists for all then most will be at least willing to try to get along.  Desperation breeds discontent.  So how do we cure poverty?  Foreign investment is a start; however, sadly the multinational companies of the Developed World only want to invest where they are reasonably sure of making a profit.  That's the way capitalism works.  One thing I did see when I visited Ecuador was that the Japanese companies had built a huge transportation bus system in Guayaquil.  Now, true, I am sure the Japanese want fishing and other trade with Ecuador so their reasons are not all humanitarian.  This is idealistic, but if every multinational company that invests in foreign countries (including the U.S.) would make a real effort to improve some infrastructure aspect of that country, perhaps it would be the boost needed for those countries to start help themselves more.

===message:I believe that you may see poverty as a component of lots of other things (education, politics, overpopulation, corruption, history, expectations). Human beings, I feel just about barely make it as a species. 
Life is very delicate and very brutal. 
Poverty is one of those sad realities.
 The solution is not usually as simple as redistributing income - although some of that is just and fair. It seems that a robust and widespread economic prosperity and a sustainable (i.e. continuous not wildly cyclical) economic activity is the sevcret to jobs and income.

===message:I don't claim to be a philosopher or economist, but it seems to me that the whole capitalist model, good or bad, revolves around a class system where there are as many really poor as there are really rich.  Of course those proportions aren't quite right, but it just seems that the whole system is based on having the majority of the people just wealthy enough to buy the products that the rich are producing.  Right now that is not the case in Third world.  The companies in there right now aren't building a middle class to buy their products but using their extensive poor population to provide products for the middle classes of the U.S. and Europe.  I guess that is the whole premise of Neo-Colonialism, to use the less advanced to provide for the home colony.  Investment is a good thing if it is in the right direction.  Multi-Nationals don't seem to want to create a better environment for the countries that they are based in and I can understand why.  If those other world counties that they are now using the poor as labor start to develop the same problems of high labor costs that they face in the developed world would become a factor and it would be more financially rewarding to move on to another predominantly poor country to set up shop.  In theory it is nice to see huge corporations invest in countries and it seems that this would benifit the people, but I think that those companies who might seem to be helping are just doing such things to mask their desire to keep the status quo just where it is so that their huge investment in factories and shiping can be buffered by the low wages and lack of benefits for their employees.  Large corporations have only two groups to patrol what they do.  The government of the countries they are in, most of which are probably on the companies bank role and the people in their home countries (us) who react to Kathy Lee and Nike if they seem to step out of line or start exploiting people too much..
