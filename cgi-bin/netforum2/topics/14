===message:I hope it is ok to use this forum for a purpose such as this. I just wanted to extend a thank-you to DeDe for the birthday cake and to Dr. Schmidt for permitting the distraction. Also, thanks very much for the happy birthday wishes that were extended. Since turning 30 seems to be sort of a traumatic experience, it was greatly appreciated. Oh, and DeDe, it was 30 and not 50 :) ! Dr. Schmidt, does this count as discussion ?
