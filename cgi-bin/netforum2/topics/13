===more:In my opinion, I think that diversity is good.  It gives the chance for other people 
to see what tradition and cultures other people have. This helps
people not to be scared of something different. Most people are scared 
of what they do not know anything about, so when we have diversity in our country, I think 
it educates people and makes them aware that there is so much out there
to see and do. I am not saying that everyone should try each culture and like it, I 
just think that there is no harm of being educated about different ways of life.

===message:I think diversity can be a powerful thing, both in a positive and negative way. In the best situation, it moves society forward. If offers the greatest opportunity to learn and evolve and also increases the potential. One of the topics we discussed in class was the tropical rain forests and their value to society. A main aspect of that value was the rich diversity of species. While diversity in human beings isn't going to contribute a seed or root that cures cancer, it can contribute an idea or thought that may lead to that cure. The more people work together the greater the contribution. Also, with reference to Dr Schmidt's comment, wouldn't it be boring to live in a society surrounded by sameness? Although I don't believe everyone should have to embrace differences,  they do have to tolerate them.  On the flip side however,  diversity also seems to cause some major dissension. Without understanding, people are divided. It may be more comfortable to surround oneself with what is easily recognized. Since people may fear the unfamiliar, that fear can turn into intolerance and we all know what that can lead to. Obviously, we can see both aspects in our own country. Our diversity in our culture makes us strong but it also breaks us down (racism etc..)

===message:I always believe that diversity is an essential element in every aspect.  I don't think anyone can acquire knowledge without the existence of diversity.  We must open up our minds and accept all possibilities that are out there.  The co-existence of different races, colors, religious backgrounds give us the chance to know more about the real world.  We might easily acknowledge the growing trend of globalization.  But it's a different thing to realize how and why they are the way they are.  In my opinion, one crucial mistake this particular society (US) is making is its inability to recognize talent on an individual basis.  Media coverages are flooded with the harms that immigrants bring to this society.  This builds up a wall, an attitude of refusal to optimize the talents that come from the multi-cultural society such as the US.  Last month a survey found that the diversed atmosphere in the US is bringing more good than bad to the economy.  But thanks to the media and individual bias, how many people would accept this fact without the image of immigrants robbing the Americans?  			Diversity is pre-conditioned.  No doubt it brings problems to every society.  But on the other hand, a country will be on the declining side without knowledge and talents from around the world.

===message:I think that diversity can have positive impacts on a scociety under certain conditions.  If the diverse groups of people who live in a particular place regognize their diversity as an asset, then it can lead to growth as a society, educated and less ignorant members of the society, and even to unity and national identity.  The united states is a good example of a place where this is happening.  Diversity is such a huge issue here and is usually presented as something positive that should be celebrated.  The government is actually implementing these ideas through public education.  In my high school (Ames High) every three years they hold a spectial day called Unity Day.  Every student picks a half dozen seminars to attend that all deal with the different relegions, cultures, and related issues that make up American society.  The goal is to expose the students (95 percent of which have similar cultural backgrounds) to different ideas about the world and to promote diversity.  Unfortunatly, I think these kinds of programs oftem seem silly to the average (cynical) Ames High Student but they are a great start and do put diversity in a positive light.  Without doing that, diversity within a state too often leads to racism and hatred.

===message:The idea of diversity is certainly a very tricky one.  On one hand it is absolutely beautiful, and quite appealing in theory: people from many different backgrounds and races with all sorts of beliefs and customs blending together (in the case of the United States) making a "well-rounded" so to speak nation.  These people remain loyal to the nation as a whole, but yet retain their identities as Caucasian or African-American, Catholic or Jewish, etc.  To some extent we as Americans are far luckier than some of the other nations that have tried this and ended up with very bloody civil wars of ethnic cleansing; though the US may still have serious problems with race, we are getting along far better than the Irish Catholics and Protestants, or the Hutus and Tutsis as mentioned in class.  So, it is a catch-22 situation: how far must we go to maintain an ideal state of nationalism without making people give up their cultural identities?

===message:I feel that diversity is a very good thing for a country to 
have.  One of the more important reasons for this is that it
allows officials of a country to draw upon the the experience
from peoples of many cultures and see things from many points
of view.  This also provides more options for solving problems.
It is because of this I feel is one of the reasons that the 
United States is as strong as it is and is therefore a major 
world power.

===message:The United States was created on the basis of diversity.  
"Give me your tired, your poor, your ugly...etc" simply means
that the US will take any person that want to come here.
Because of this diversity, the United States is the most
admired nation on the planet.  Of course, with all of our
diversity, comes our internal problems.  Friction develops
between "inner" groups.  I believe this occurs because certain
cultures are not willing to learn from other cultures.  Some people
think that their culture is the best and therefore, people of
other cultures must conform to thiers.  It's kind of like
going to a foreign country and only eating at McDonald's.  Why
bother?
People may have egotistic reasons for not wanting to learn
another culture, but also may be afraid of other cultures.
People who think their's is the best do not want to know
the flaws and the errors within their culture.  Proabably because
people, in general, are afraid of change.   People are not
willing to try something new because they are satisfied with
what they have.

===message:Diversity is a universl issue.  It's lead to celebration in places such as the United States, while it has lead to civil war and international conflict in others.  In many dveloping countries ethnic diversity is a large part of 
traditions and customs.  When people in these countries are subjected to the hard living conditions that's common with less developed nations, loyalty to one's own ethnic group challenges the "nonbiast" government.  When it happens to be a biast government govt. overthrow is in sight.  
Ireland is an exception to this rule, where the country is developed.  Yet the hypr-sensitive ethnic loyalty is undermining the govetnment which is holding the country together. One reason why developed nations do not have so many ethnic conflicts is because there is little diversity.  Again, an exception is Switzerland.  
For many developed countries, their developedness acts as a buffer to deal with ethnic conflicts.  Thus, the problems are truely addressed before they escalate.

===message:	DIVERSITY:
	In my view diversity can be good thing to a society, but it also can be bad. It can be a good thing because it brings strength and choice to a society. One of the reason for US. strength and popularity internationally I believe comes from its diversified society. Here one has a chance to meet people from different origin and background, one does not have to worry about what is for dinner, what sort of music to listen to, or what TV channel to tune to and so forth. You live your life  the way you want to, do business your way without outside interference. People visiting end up staying because of the freedom of choice that this country provides to its potencial residents. So in my in view all these elements contribute for the greatness of this country nationally and internationally.
However, it also can be a bad thing. Diversity means different race with different culture, moral values, behavior and interest. With these elements of diversity comes the issue of mutual respect and appreciation for each other, which in case of US is an  untangible goal.  Racial conflicts, cultural misunderstanding, and conflict of interest make this country a very tense place to survive. Here the survive of the fittest is kicking in every day. So diversity can make it difficult for people to get along with each other in a friendly manner.

===message:    I believe that the United States greatest strength is the
diversity within its population. However, I think that it's 
very sad that when people come here from other countries and 
within a generation or two, their children or grandchildren, 
sometimes even they themselves, have abandoned their heritage
and culture. People who come to the U.S. seem too eager to 
adopt the generic, bluejean-wearing, cigarette smoking 
American mentality and behavior. I believe that pride in and 
demonstration of one's roots and heritage is very important,
not only for those who come from that background, but also for
the community as a whole. Though trite, I truly believe that
you cannot know where you are going if you don't know where 
those who came before have been. Though I will never know what
it's like to be an African-American in the South or an illegal
immigrant in southern California, by listening and being open
to their experiences I believe that anyone can better 
themselves and learn from their experiences. Everyone in a
society has something to teach the rest and even though what 
they have to teach may not be momentous or change to world, it
just may change one person's life and in America, it's the 
individual who matters.

===message:I think that regardless of how many colors you see in a country we are all equally diverse.  America is really a great place for diversity.  We are starting to realize how very special we all are.  Some people lose touch of their heritage but others grow stronger because all these people are aware that there is nobody else like them in the world.  People should like to be different.  I strive to dye my hair a different color than everybody else's.  Why?  I want to stand out.  People always talk about how hard it is to be black or hispanic.  But me, I think it is hard to be white.  Why?  Because just as blacks hate it when people stare at them, I hate it that they don't stare I have a very diverse group of friends.  I love my hispanic friends because of their sense of family, and I like learning dirty spanish words.  I love my black friends for the same reason I love my white friends and my hispanic friends.  We are all the same, yet a color of skin that is different makes diversity.  Go figure.
