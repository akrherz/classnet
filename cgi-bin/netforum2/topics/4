===message: As stated in class discussion today, Europe was and still 
remains a strong bed of nationalism.  This entrenched 
nationalism has been a factor in the recent disputes and 
negotiations involving the establishment of the European 
Union and a single currency, the euro.  From its conception, 
the progress toward EU was driven with supranational 
government in mind, especially within the agendas of former
European Commission President Jacques Delors and German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Obviously, supranational government
is a far cry from the nationalist attitudes of many 
Europeans. The pinnacle of achievement for the EU 
would be the implementation of the euro.  Nationalism 
surfaces strongly among the Germans, who despise giving
up their D-mark and sharing their economic prowess with the 
EU member nations.  Despite the media attention given to
"globalization," nationalism remains an important factor
in understanding the nuances of current affairs.

===message:    The most recent occurence of colonialism that were lead by the european powers had its good and its bad, but the bad out-weighs the good. 
The things that are looked as good things for development in today's terms that were contributed by the conquerors to the native people have been
the development of large scale transportation systems (hyways), introduction of large scale factories, latest technology, European medicine, and European style education. 
Which of the above were developed depended on the colonial power.  The Colonial Powers established Cash Crops in the conquered land, which were crops designed specifically 
for the need of the Mother Country and to be exported.   The negative aspect of these cash crops come when these colonial powers have left after their long stay, and the 
specific crop which is being mass produced for some reason or another is no longer marketable, then the former colonial country is left with land which the Invaders transformed
into their specific needs and now must be painfully dealt with in growing entirely different products, or products which were being grown prior to the invasion.  One of the 
desierable effects of Colonialism which is visible is the transportation system which these European Nations left behind which include Hyways and rail-roads and ports.  One of 
the least desirable effects left behind by the Colonials is the situation in which conquered nations which were prior to being invaded did not had a booming population growth rate\
now suddenly has this problem after and during the Colonial period. 
    What 'blows my mind' is how the invading nations justified the ethical situation of invading another land by ethnocentric views of religeon, language, and culture (in most cases).  It still surprises me how Colonials could force another People to be inferior and to 
manupilate their nation into a Slave Land in terms of natural resourses.

===message:Colonialism does have its good points and its bad.  When Britain took over India they set up the railroad system and got the economy moving but in exchange they exploited the native people.  I think that without colonialism the world would certainly not be what it is today.  Whether that is good or bad I don't really know.  It seems to me like Spain's involvement in Latin America looks a lot like the Ottoman-Turkirsh and Austro-Hungarian involvement in Europe.  Colonialism is another form of expanding the land that one country owns and using it to benefit the mother country.  Maybe it is wrong but, it is why there is an America and it is also why people like Ghandi have become moral figures in the world's history.  I think that we learn from our mistakes.  Colonialism was the only thing the world knew and perpetuating it did not seem wrong at that time. It was only later that the world noticed the problems that it created.  But, the amount of knowledge gained has made it possible for the world to see that changes in behavior were inevitable and guildlines for power were needed.

===message:I feel that colonialism and neocolonialism in certain specifics can bring a positive impact in certain forms.  I can speak first hand on the positive influences of U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf.  During Operation Southern Watch I had been a part of a team to train Saudi nationals on avionic F-15 communication, navigational, and penetration aid system specialists to further educate them on the electrical intricacies of the Band-3 internal countermeasures system ensuring that the Saudi pilots had secure defense systems and maintenance was knowledgeable enough to fix the problems. This fact has kept the Saudi Air Force up to date with ever changing technologys in military defense.  Along with the increasing sales of arms such as F-15E Strike Eagles we are helping to ensure our interests of the natural resources of oil in the middle east.  By not only providing protection and arms we are increaing sales in our own private sector, thus leading to a stronger economy, peace controls in middle east and increased transport of oil. This cooperation between nations has kept nations of Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia free from the tyranny of Iraq. The impacts reach every body, U.S. involvement has reached beyond political and economic goals. Our presence has saved many a life from needlessly dying and has reached upon other social dynamics.  After returning from the gulf I realize that our influence may go too far and U.S. has shown in history  a way of policing countries that do not need our influence. But I feel the gulf may be one of those rare instances that our impact caused more good than harm.

===message:I think that the issue that whether colonialism was a posotive thing or not depends on ones point of view
If you are the colonialist aka the conqueror, than it is a good thing because youhave control of an other land
which will add to the countries wealth, power, and population.
However if you are a native of that land, it is a bad thing because 
here you have outsiders comming in and imposing thier ideals
on you of which you may or may not agree with.

===message:Can we really say it was good or bad to colonize another country?
Who knows, maybe the United States would have been worse off 
if Europe had not colonized.  The United States could also have 
been an even more technically advanced country than what it is
currently.  The point is, we will never know because we can not 
change the past to create a new present and future.  Colonization
helped shape many countries and establish their identities they
have today.

===message:	COLONIALISM:
I would like to think of the term much like an interaction between rich  and poor countries or so called North and South. I am using " rich and poor" as an economic distintion. So, to me colonialism was simply an economic interaction in almost the same way the business is done today overseas. In business, as in any other game there are winner and loser. I don't blame the North for taking any advantage or profit from other World. The issue here is about being intelligent and smart in business.Europeans knew what they wanted.and the other guys including my country didn't.In some cases they didn't even know the value of their resources,land, human etc. At that time they just played stupid in dealing with europeans.It is time to let that feeling go...to stop blaming europeans because I would have done the same thing if I had this fabulous deal. Whatever the consequences, you just have to live with it and learn from your past mistakes so won't repeat it again...and please move forward. Don't give up, stay on the game and please do have an economic agenda ready when you go for business. In addition, stand for what you believe in...don't give in easily. Had African chiefs been good dealers instead of selling their people, Africa would have enjoyed much better reputation perhaps in all levels of human endeavour rather than a dumping ground for western industrial waste. If Africans had known how to do it, they could have thaken the advantage of the scientific know how from Europeans. To me colonialism was not a bad thing, it was a lost opportunity. And to me what is funny is that colonialism is still evident today in many overseas business...but they call it newcolonialism.
