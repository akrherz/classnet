Yes, cultural differences do play a big role in the ability to get along, but I truly believe that if economic opportunity exists for all then most will be at least willing to try to get along.  Desperation breeds discontent.  So how do we cure poverty?  Foreign investment is a start; however, sadly the multinational companies of the Developed World only want to invest where they are reasonably sure of making a profit.  That's the way capitalism works.  One thing I did see when I visited Ecuador was that the Japanese companies had built a huge transportation bus system in Guayaquil.  Now, true, I am sure the Japanese want fishing and other trade with Ecuador so their reasons are not all humanitarian.  This is idealistic, but if every multinational company that invests in foreign countries (including the U.S.) would make a real effort to improve some infrastructure aspect of that country, perhaps it would be the boost needed for those countries to begin to 'takeoff' economically.

I'VE POSTED THIS INCASE SOMEONE MISSED IT FROM YOUR FORUM NOTE. 

POVERTY IS A SYMPTOM OF POOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND OF UNFAIRNESS.

===message:Investing in the developing countries can be a real help to these nations.  But the coorperations that do so should be willing to do so without abusing human rights, paying decent wages and giving friendly benifits.  As Dr.P mentioned, it would be very nice if multi-national coorperations would invest in infrastructure building aswell.  An incentive at investment could be to give companies willing to create jobs in developing countries tax breaks.  It would be encouraging for developed nations if special policies were given to them as incentives by developing countries for investmenting.  
These packages could include such policies as giving monoplies in return for creating good paying jobs with good benefits and hours.  There is a major 'positive' in investing in an underdeveloped country by a developed country's government.  Which is that once the infrastructure is developed and poor people have been given decent jobs, housing and other basic needs, the economy starts going upward with life.  When this happens, international cooperations can come and start selling their products in a 'capitalistic market'.

===message:When a company in the United States invests in another countries 
economy it is relatively good.  The only problem I have with this
is when the company pays the worker well below what a person in 
the United States would make.  I think that if a company is going
to invest in other countries it should pay them approximately the 
same wages that the company is already paying their employees in
the United States.  By looking for cheap labor the company is 
hurting both citizens in the U.S. and in the other country.  It
takes jobs away from the U.S. and it also shows me how little we
think of other people by refusing to pay them what the job is 
actually worth.  Who knows.  Maybe the job actually pays sixtey
cents an hour and the people in the U.S. are just to greedy that
they think they need to be paid more.

===message:I don't see any problem at all with the US investing in other countries. Although it may be hard to stomach the idea of sweat shop labor, it seems to be a fact of life. Also, I don't think it's a valid argument to say that by exporting these jobs we are hurting the American workers. From my understanding, most of the jobs being done in these places are horrible, repetiteve, and boring. Frankly, I don't think the majority of Americans would be willing to do them anyway. Just look at the meat processing industry (IBP, Monfort) in Iowa. They are constantly getting raided for illegal immigrants but does it really matter. No, they continue to hire them because they can't get enough legals or residents to do that work for the wage they pay.

===message:I think investing in other countries is good for both the
American economy and the economy of the other country.  Yes,
building a factory in a different country is decreasing the 
number of jobs available in the United States.  At the same
time it is lowering prices we as consumers pay.  Most of these
other countries where factories are moving to are underdeveloped
and could use an industry to either start building their economy
or enhancing their economy.  It is kind of like reciprocal 
foreign aid.  

The sweat shops have to go though.
I think if the United States or any other country for that
matter wants to build a factory in a different place then they
better have the full intentions of creating an working enviroment 
with equal standards of what they would have to do on their 
own soil.

===message:I disagree with most Americans imposing their set beliefs to other nations regarding labor and foreign investment.  Americans possess a self rightousness due to high standards of living that most others do not.  Developing countries are under adverse economic hardships it is essential that they encourage U.S. investment.  The U.S. cannot feel alone in the pressure of losing jobs or monies abroad.  Survival of the fittest applies here.  If another can produce a product cheaper and U.S. investment in capital will help produce the plant then I think we cannot have selfish resentment towards them.  After all we can't complain when we buy cheaper made foreign goods often at better quality then overpriced American made goods.  Nationalistic feelings can only go so far.  The U.S. makes billions off its own exports, why can't another country?  Whoever can produce at the lowest cost will end up controlling the market.  This comparative advantage is all about commen sense economics, not about American needs and desires.  Americans have to understand that we are not all alone in this world.

===message:I think investing in other country is a good thing.  It
improve the economy for American as itself and as for the 
other country too.  Both countries can benefit from each other.  
In the U.S, companies can cut down expenses and consumers will not
pay less for the products that the companies are producing.
For the other country that American have invested will surely
get the benefit of creating new jobs and definely help improve 
their economy, especially for undevelop countries.

===message:The issues we've already raised about FDI are all valid points in current policy discussion.  A clarifying factor is that foreign direct investments encompass an entire realm of financing and investing, and FDI is not synonymous with the upstart of new manufacturing.  One interesting case involves Argentina.  In 1991 the Argentines devalued their national currency and set up a new "hard" money back 100% by the dollar.  This step along the path of "economic liberalization" has had several effects.  Chiefly, the perceived improvement in currency stability has generated foreign investments.  As a result, local development banks in Latin America, such as IDB, can now focus their efforts on smaller economies, because FDI has given projects in Argentina a surge of capital.  IDB is now focusing more on the local development of small business enterprise.  By using FDI to finance larger projects, development banks could see an increase in the productivity of their projects by focusing on small businesses.  I see small business investments by indigenous people as a shining example of "development" at its finest, because promoting innovation and independence is crucial to empowering the underprivledged to fight poverty through their political systems.
