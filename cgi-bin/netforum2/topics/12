===message:I found Uri's (not sure that's spelled right) talk on Belarus very interesting.  The situation sounds pretty bleak at the moment.  I fear unless the developed world can find some way to help these newly independent republics establish a market economy that improves their lives many will be easy prey for return to a central authoritarian government and dictators.  The population has not been educated on how to develop a free market system and although they may have not had many freedoms under communist rule for many their standard of living was at least somewhat better with prices held in check.  No wonder, particularly the older generation in Belarus think life was better under communism.  Although the 'cold war' is officially ended.  I feel less secure because of the uncertainty of who's ultimately going to be in control in these former Soviet Republics (in other words who has the keys to the missile bases).

===message:Since I consider myself to be somewhat internationally and geographically challenged, I found Mr. Alexeichenko's talk extremely beneficial. Based upon the information both he and the handouts provided and also based on the discussion in class today, I find the situation a bit disquieting. Although Dr. Schmidt mentioned that the evolution of a 'national identity' can have difficulties, is it possible that the right (or wrong, depending how you look at it) type of leader can create one?  In other words, if a charismatic, populist type of individual can get people to buy into their lies, could an identity be induced?  From what the gentleman said, it sounds like this Lukashenko dude can be pretty persuasive. I think the most worrisome aspect of the whole thing is the idea of a guy, who seems to enjoy power and control, ruling in an area where the inventory of nuclear warheads doesn't quite balance. On another note, in what part of the former soviet union did the experts on nuclear power reside?  As I understand it, the Chernobyl plant has been left alone and is continuing into a state of greater disrepair. In addition to the political instability of Belarus, I'd be a little worried about the environmental problems. That radiation map showed a pretty significant area in the red.

===message:Uri was a tremendously insightful speaker.  I really enjoy getting the perspective of international news from the source.  Sometimes (most times) I find it hard to read U.S. news without thinking deep down inside how much is really true.  I hope Uri's country and the rest of the former Soviet Union republics get it together.  It really scares me that the nuclear arsenal that was stockpiled during the cold war is now in the hands of struggling counties that could really benefit in selling the weapons or even possibley an extremely nationalistic government taking hold of the weapons and using them.  If Chernobyl was bad the potential of all those weapons running around loose right now would be ten times worse in the hands of the desperate or crazy.

===message:One of the obviously most interesting things about Belarus
was thier lack of nationalism.  I got the feeling that 
Belarusians had no sense of national identity.  But, even
more interesting than that, I got the feeling that they also
didnt care about what was going on in thier country. Almost
as if they tought it was someone elses problem to deal 
with.

===message:I have mixed feelings about Belarus and its leader's disire to unite with Russia.  His method of seizing power and maintaining it, seems a little too much like Hitler.  Hopefully, Lukasenka isn't a bipolar syphilis stricken man with the disire to commit genocide.  I probly won't know, until it's too late, of his true ambitions with his absolute control over the media in Belarus.  Perhaps he'll be more like a Napolean autocrate.  Napolean didn't have a completely negative impact on France and Europe.  He had brought about the code of Napolean, which treated all French as equals and gave them freedom in religion.  Perhaps if he had achieved his goal of uniting Europe, the world would have been saved from WWI and WWII.  

Another country in the former Soviet bloc, Bulgaria, I think is interesting to observe.   Their economy was doing terrible.  Hopefully their elections will help turn things around and a another autocrate, such as Lukaenka, does't raise to power.
