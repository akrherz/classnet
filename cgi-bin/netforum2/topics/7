===more:In the last week, we were talking about what we felt about the increasing pop.  I was wondering about how others think or feel about, how the United States can keep going with a increasing number of single parent families that can only afford to have one child but have 3,4, or more childern.  The same people are using the U.S. government to "pick up the tab" for the support that they need, rather then getting a job.   Maybe, if you cant afford to have chilern - dont!  So many people are not taking advantage of government -free- birth control, but use the welfare programs to take care of their kids, and not what it is ment for, to get people who are not working enought money to live until they get  working again.  Should more programs be applyed to stop persons from taking hard earned money from the tax payers and stop the money from going to those who use it as a pay check not to work.  Maybe programs that would stop payment to persons that ARE able to work?

===message:Although I don't buy into the Gaia theory, I do think that nature has a way of keeping things in a balance. I suppose it's possible that the human population could reach a "critical mass" resulting in famine and war. In addition, the resulting conditions could provide opportunity for disease and death. However, I think this would result in some sort of correction of our numbers and not an extinction. So, I don't think that the population explosion will crush everyone.  Heck, if our technology continues at the rapid pace it is, we may end up colonizing Mars or Europa. Then we could enforce some sort of maximum occupancy for earth and everyone else would have to go to the colony. Oh, but that opens up a whole new can of worms regarding who goes. That last part was meant to be a bit of comic relief for an otherwise serious topic. : )

===message:As far as the worlds population crushing us, i think thats far
from the actual truth.  Im not a naturalist of anything but if
there is anything that nature has taught us, its that it has its
own way of population control when the environment can no longer 
handle it.  As a population gets larger and more chaotic, 
it gets more complex which leads toward behavioral breakdown
and depleation of the population.

===message:As far as advancements in medicine speading throughout the undeveloped world and causing a massive population explosion, there is nothing to worry about.  The development of antibiotics has saved millions of people this century, causing populations to grow even faster.  But nature took care of that problem with natural selection.  Antibiotics are quickly losing their effectivness bacuse bacteria have evolved to resist them.  Even if science helped human populations to grow for a while by aiding in health problems, we must remember that the kinds of health conditions we live under now are not nessesarily permanent.  Plague, famine, and war are the facts of life on earth.  Medical and other types of technology can help us to curb the effects of these for a while, but like the antibiotics paradox, in the long run, the chances are good that not much will have been changed.  The population explosion cannot crush us all because if technology helps populations to grow, then chances are it can find solutions for the problem of overcrowding.  And if technology is overcome by nature, then that is population control in itself.

===message:I don't believe in the Gaia theory either.  If the world could control the population explosion
then we wouldn't have people in China and other countries saying that boys should live and that
girls should somehow be aborted or whatever else might happen to baby girls.  I do believe that
the world is becoming over populated and something should be done about it but I do not believe
that boys should be the ones who live.  I think that just because parents have to furnish a dowry
for a girls marriage isn't the end of the world.  Think of all those boys who won't have a wife
when the time comes for them to marry.  They won't have anyone to marry.

===message:Will the world population explosion crush US all?  No, I don't believe that the world population explosion wil crush US all.  The issue in itself is very complex.  In the recent human history, many of the liminating factors of population have been overcome, though improvements in agricultural methods, health, and sanitation.  Plague, famine, and war are no longer as important of factors on population growth.  This has lead to exponential growth of the world population, predications have the world population increasing from 5.5 billion to 10-12 billion people by the year 2050.  So called 'experts'  want to achieve a stabilizing target population of 10 billion.  I don't think it should be the goal to achieve 10 billion people and a fertility rate of 2%, but rather an indirect  result stimulated by world organizations.  More importantly, I think that focus needs to be placed on surporting the population.  Not neccessarily so much on feeding it, but rather on dealing with the waste products.  The United States and Argentina could, by themselve, feed 1.4 billion more people with their idle and under utilized land.

In a biology experiment, if one kepts freshening the supply of all required nutrients for growing a bacterial culture; after an episode of exponential growth, the population will still crash.  Like all organisms, bacteria produce metabolic wastes.

A Chinese poet said in the year 500 BC, "If you are thinking a year ahead, sow a seed.  If you are thinking ten years ahead, plant a tree.  If you are thinking one hundred years ahead, educate the people."

Personally, having lived in The Netherlands, one of the most highly densely populated countries of the world, I don't believe population density is much of a problem, if regulated effectively.

I don't believe that there should be world policies, such as in China, where a couple recieves a monthly cash payment and better social treatment.  Such things, I believe, should be a case by case solutions.  Living in the United States, I think that it will be a long time before population control becomes an issue.  In North America and in Europe, population growth seems to slow down on their own as nations developed economically.

===message:The population of the world is growing at a catastrophic rate, and yes it could potentially be harmful to our species.  But, I feel that the population growth is not what will get humans in the end.  I think that we will all either be killed off by some disease such as AIDS or kill off the planet before it can kill us.  It is cause for concern when the number of humans on earth exceeds what earth can handle, but that fear is nothing compared to what may happen instead.  All we need to do is upset Iran or another terrorist country and boom we are all gone anyway.  I feel that we need to focus on other issues than population growth because if our biggest problem is how do we take care of so many healthy happy people than I feel that we are doing alright.
