===message:Warning: LONG...
What I admire most about the Puritans is their desire and effort to be "pure" (no pun intended).  The telling of the truth was very important (as a value) and this caused some of the accused to go to their deaths rather than "admit" guilt they didn't have.  Also, it was probably one of the reasons people were so apt to believe the children.   Their biggest hangup was probably the fact that they didn't know how to explain the "afflictions"  and so they fell to their belief in Satan and Satan's ability to cause afflictions.  They also were of the opinion that bad things were a result of Satan working through people.  Apparently there really were witches (or at least people who "conjured" things and practiced witchcraft somehow) but whether they were really effective or just some kind of mumbo jumbo is unknown.  
Why the hysteria?  Partly because they didn't have an explanation and partly because there were so many involved.  The collaboration between the accusers and the "afflicted" girls fueled the fire that led to the hysteria.  If one says it is happening, or even two, there can be quite a lot of doubt, but not when so many all seemed to be affected.

===message:The thing I most admired about the Puritans was the way they took care of each other.  If someone was old, sick or disabled they were taken care of.  Although they had great compassion toward other Puritans, they seemed to have none for anyone who had different beliefs from them. They were certainly complex people to have so much compassion for their own, but so little tolerance and compassion for anyone whose beliefs were different. There probably were some people indulging in some sort of superstitution. I think the Puritans reacted the way they did because of all the uncertainty and stress they had to be living with at the time.  The people accused of witchcraft were scapegoats for other things going on that could not be concretely dealt with such as being attacked by Indians, am I destined for heaven or hell?, etc.

===message:The good thing i liked about the Puritans was that despite the fact that many of the girls denied being witches, at least one of them was truthful which made a big difference. One thing i hated about them was that they kept initiating people into their witchcrats world which i taught was not a good idea because that left the innocent ones to be scared and not to trust many of their people. It also created many crisis for example, many innocent people were suspected as being witches. I certainly believe that there was witchcrat in the Puritans society because For one, none of them believed in God and they had their own control over their destinies. Most of their thoughts were evil. Even Tituba did confessed that she is a witch and i guess she wanted to be delivered from her evil dids that was why she decided to confess. For those who did not confessed, i am glad they were all executed.

Their biggest hang up was the fact that they were burning women at the stake for in one way or another the same reasons that they left England- They were afraid of change in any form.  I mean they came to new colonies to have religious freedom, only to kill the Indians that already inhabited the lands, and then get paranoid and start killing each other.  What is the deal with that?

I don't think there were witches in massachussetts bay. they just believed in what the belief and had to live by it.Even though one of the beliefs was the devil, they had so much fear for the devil.Witches and devil's servant were always battling them. In that case they had to belief in them so they would not be haunted. It does not mean they themselves were withces.
There was so much mass hysteria over this issue because people thought and still think there is more to what the puritan's belief than what they heard and saw.

It was just being paranoid. The fact that the girls being led by Tituba were  dancing naked in the forest around the fire does not provide enough prove to say that there were witches in the village. Tituba just confessed her belief. The only thing that puzzles is the way they kept on naming one another. It is not right however, the fact that they persecuted the accused victims.

Different versions of the religion was not looked good upon as far as i can tell. Their biggest hang up to me is that they took these witch trails a little to far. The hangings that were done were unnesscary in my opinion. I don't even believe there were any witches, it was just the devil in this people making them act out and tell unnesscary lies. I believe there was so much hysteria over the issue because it totally went against what was taught. Like i stated earlier the purtains could not tolerate people getting off on the wrong track.

I admire their religion the most, that is what they based their whole being on. Although, all of these witch trials were going on, people were suspected of being involved with witch craft or even being a witch, but they would say they were innocent. It would be a lie if they did not tell the truth and that is a sin. I admire that they hold their religion that high, even if confessing and admitting guilt meant staying alive. The only reason Tituba was not put to death was because she confessed. Even though I admire their religion, I also feel this was their biggest hang-up. Its was good to be religious, but the way religion was portrayed, the puritans made it seem like there is only one way, and it was there way. In the end everyone is to looking up to the same being, so what does it matter what religion you are? Today we have so many different religions, Catholic, Baptist, Episcopal, etc. There are all different, but one in the same. They all give glory to one being. Of course with every religion there are going to be different, but still at the end of the day, its all about one being. My personal opinion probably contradicts everyone else's but yes, I do think there were witches, just because I believe in that stuff. I believe in black magic and witches. It had to originate somewhere. All Tituaba was trying to do was educate them. I think there was so much hysteria over this issue because the puritans did not know exactly what it was. People tend to fear what they dont know. I think if they would have given a chance to Witchery and witch craft they would then be able to form an opinion about whether it was good or bad.

===message:The Puritans of Masschusetts Bay were an admirable society with many with many good qualities as well as faults. Many of the great and enduring qualities of this society came from their rigid religious beliefs, however many of their hangups came from this same source.  The society that the Purtains built was one dutiful christains who helped one other and was grounded by family unites.  Each person had a place and a role in Puritan society. The rich helped the poor and they even help each other with parenting.  This unity and giving to other was only directed to "their own" however.  The Puritans were very much sepratist and they did not tolerate only with varing religious views.  Those who were different were not welcome and dissenter to the beliefs of the colonies church were banished from the colony or prosecuted.

The question of whether there were witches in the Massachusetts Bay colony has been answered by many to be no.  In the sixteen hundreds people though of many things as being supernatural, a way to explain the unknown and seemimgly misterious happening or bad events.  The serious and restrict nature of the Purtians beliefs did not help this matter.  Women gossiping or child born out of wedlock were signs to them that someone was praticing witchcraft.  They simplfied their world though this and in doing so they accused many innocent people of the crime of black magic.

There was so much mass hysteria surrounding the issue of withcraft because of the combination of the stress and anxiety of war, and the agendas of a few.  This combination started and help fan the flame of the accusations of witchcraft.  Many of the those who were accused of witch craft implicted others in to avoid themselves. Those who were accused often confessed  to save themselves from excution.  This helped stirr the mass hysteria which lead to the death of twenty people.

===message:What I admire the most about the Puritans of Massachusetts is how they used religious beliefs to hold their community together. They lived their lives as they believed God had ordained. "The rich and powerful were supposed to take care of those who were poor and powerless." (79) If we today followed that simple statement, I believe we would be much better off as citizens, as a country and as people. On the same token, their biggest hang up was their religion. The Bible is open for interpretation. I believe they took the message from the Bible too seriously. Like the excerpt on page 83, "Childhood in Puritan New England," the readings from the Bible put fear in the eight year old child that she couldn't escape. It just got to be too much. I don't believe there were witches in Massachusetts Bay. I believe it was the misinterpretation of the reading from the Bible that scared everyone into this hysteria. If they couldn't believe or excuse and action away they automatically believed it was the work of some evil being (witch). These so called witches were a majority of women. If these women did things differently or behaved in a different fashion, they had to be witches. Well if that's the case, half of this world would be considered witches.

===message:It takes true conviction to be willing to relocate in a new country, and the Puritans proved that they indeed had a strong conviction when it came to their religion.  But the extent they went to in order to establish christianity is shameful on many levels.  After settling in America and establishing Christianity, they forgot the main reason they left Europe, which was to practice a religion of their choice without being pursecuted.  Here we find the Puritans having no tolerance for any other religion, fighting the Native Americans over land that rightfully is theirs, and pursecuting women who they beleive to be witches.  It is often said that the most religious people can be the biggest "hell raisers".  This phrase certainly describes the Puritans.

 The Puritan’s biggest hang up was they wanted to distance themselves from sinners and establish a society based upon the word of God. 

 I think there weren’t witches in Massachusetts Bay. When the two little girls started playing with magic, the adults questioned where did they learn the witchcraft.  The town of Salem blew the situation out of proportion.  I think the accusation of witches was an unconscious resentment, brought on by the increasing commercialization of the New England economy.  It’s not like these people didn’t believe in a supernatural power, magic, and getting their palms read.

Discussion Two

	The thing that stands out about the Massachusetts Bay colony was significant of religion.  I admired the fact that religion was suppose to be what would establish that colony.  At the same time my admiration of their religion was also their biggest hang-up.  The colony was headed in the right direction, but they began to use religious interpretations to manipulate people for advancement in the colony.  

	The hysteria was caused because people began to cry witchcraft as away to get revenge on their enemies, which caused a large amount of people to get killed and most had never committed any type of crime.

On the other hand, I believe if the followers truly studied their Bible, church membership would not be predicated upon an outward demonstration to prove if they were saved. How hypocritical!
I cannot unequivocally state that I believe that there were or were not any witches in Salem. The jury is still out. I believe that there was mass hysteria because people have always feared the unknown. One wants to always attribute an explanation for any type of misfortune. When there is no explanation, one is made up and has snow ball effect.

I think that the driving force behind these attrocities was greed and jealousy.  This is evident in the biblical commandments that they violated.  Namely "Thou shalt not bear false witness", "Thou shalt not covet", and the formost of these, "Thou shalt not kill".  There is no such thing as witches.  Fear is a great motivator.
