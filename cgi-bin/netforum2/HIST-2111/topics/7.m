===subject:Nullification as seen by Tocqueville
===message:The following is a quote from Tocqueville's <u>Democracy in America, Vol. 1, Part B</u>.  From it, I intend to glean some insight into the mind of the man who, and the heart of the matter that, is the subject of this examination.<br><br>

"The entire doctrine of Nullification is comprised in a sentence uttered by Vice-President Calhoun, the head of that party in the South, before the Senate of the United States, in the year 1833: 'The Constitution is a compact to which the States were parties in their sovereign capacity; now, whenever a compact is entered into by parties which acknowledge no tribunal above their authority to decide in the last resort, each of them has a right to judge for itself in relation to the nature, extent, and obligations of the instrument.' It is evident that a similar doctrine destroys the very basis of the Federal Constitution, and brings back all the evils of the old confederation, from which the Americans were supposed to have had a safe deliverance."<br><br>

It is safe to say that when Tocqueville says, "brings back all the evils of the old confederation," and uses in particular the word, "destroys," he makes it quite clear that his view of Nullification is not favorable.  Rather, he sees that America, if it is to stand together as a powerful and unified country, must be exactly that: unified.  Preceding the above quote, Tocqueville examines the events that led up to the southern states' theories of Nullification and presents the motives that led to this pracice.  
<br><br>
Tocqueville also states, "I have shown in the proper place that the object of the Federal Constitution was not to form a league, but to create a national government."  Tocqueville has clearly established the basis of an argument that shows Nullification to be both harmful to the American states as a whole and a regretful departure from the course of a heretofore forward-moving nation.  In short, Tocqueville would call Nullification an illogical, backward act of treason.

===message:Tocqueville believed the Nullificaton crises was brought on by the rapid shift and change in the economy from one  area of the country to another.  The northern states, particularly the northwestern, were growing economically faster and they were more diversified.  I also think people are more confident and less afraid when they are in charge of their own destiny and not dependent on the work of others.  Although it's an over simplication, the people in the northern states weren't afraid to get their own hands dirty.  As far as today, all you have to do is look at current events via radio, television, internet, newspaper, etc... to see how economic developments shape the political scene today.  The two major political parties certainly have different ideas and they both want to be back by people with clout.  Do tax cuts jump start the economy?  Should the rich have the same tax cuts as the poor or middle class because they create the jobs?  I can only speak for myself, but one of the things I look for when deciding who I will vote for is how is it going to effect my pocketbook.

===message:The problem that came with the Nullification was tariffs that Congress refused to back down on.  The tariffs are what eventually led to Nullification not being passed.  The economy in the North had manufacturing; however, in the South the economy was based on agriculture.  The tariff law placed high restrictions affecting agriculture in the South, which is why many southern states did not want the law to be passed.  The economy has a great effect on political issues, since it is the economy that shapes what people will spend their money on.  Spending will then cause the government to place restrictions on things in the economy, and from those restrictions political issues will be formed.  In today’s economy there is no clear line between the economy and the government.  Our government places restrictions on public spending for just about everything, and since the government has such an influence in Americans every day lives governmental control gives way to so many political issues.

The laws that were passed by the federal government in other words the tariffs helped both buyers and sellers gain profit and had some benefits. since the south were basically into agriculture(farming, etc) they really did not see it as a great improvement. Economic development helps bring about peace within politics. Also allow politicians to do as they say. Example: job stability and reducing taxes.

The changes in the market economy contributed to the nullification crisis because the federal tariff law was affecting the southern states and they were not benefiting so they felt cheated and intimidated because the northern states were more diversified and the tariff was not affecting the northern states because they based on manufacturing.

    The Nullification crisis affected the Northern region more than the South. The Economy in the Southern states was all based by the agriculture while in the Northern states, it was based on manufacturing. Thus, the tariffs was favoring the Northern states more than the SOuthern states. How did changes in the market economy contribute to this crisis? 

     The laws passed by the federal government were in form of the tariffs which favored the Nothern region more than the south. This affected the market economy especially among the buyers and the sellers. More buyers and sellers who were manufacturers in the north gained alot of profit from the tariffs.For instance, the federal tariff law helped merchants through increased profits; this benefited the Northern region.In what ways do economic developments shape political issues today? 
   
     The political issues is directly proportional to the economic development. This means that when the economy of the country is booming then the political issues of the country are dealt in a better way.Economic stability is crucial in the planning of the government plans,budget and agendas. If the government is economically stable then the leaders are more secure and stable in making and reinforcing political issues.

===message:The weakness of the union goverment to uphold and enforce the tenets of democracy as enshrined in the constitution was more to blame for the nullification crisis.According to Tocqville,Calhoun and his cohorts from the South almost derailed the very basis of federal constitution and "brought back the anarchy from which the Americans were delivered by the act of 1789." The whole crisis was engendered by the failure of the south to dominate the union and hence perpetuate slave labor as opposed to the modern industrialization efforts championed by the North which was not pro slavery.Opposition to the tarriffs was a perfect opportunity for them to hatch their premeditated plans to actually pull out of the union.In today America,capitalism seems to be at the peak. The winners of political positions are the owners and controllers of the highly industrialized economy. Election results have been more in the favors of higher campaign fund raisers, the richer and more popular you are the better your chances of being elected to an office.

In what ways do economic developments shape political issues today? .................................................................................

I would have to say that according to the way Tocqueville spoke of American associations, the blame would have to fall on the South Carolina Association.  Widespread panic in South Carolina(but not in many of the other southern states)from the tariffs of 1828 prompted South Carolina to defend itself.  Confronted with abolition and having to buy products from the North that they previously purchased from other countries, the southern economy of slavery and agriculture was under fire in South Carolina.  With such pressures on it, South Carolinian elite were only trying to protect their money.  Granted that not all South Carolinians hurt by the tariff of 1828 were "elite".  With their population moving westward, and their money in Jeopardy, the fear of slave rebellion, and basically their whole way of life under fire, South Carolinians "stayed inside and pouted while the rest of the states of the Union played kickball."
Let's see....economic developments today....hmmmmm......electric cars......mmm..no.........hydrogen based fuel sytems...ummmm....no.........destroying tundra to drill for oil....YAY!......buying oil reserves from Bolivia, subsequently starting riots and demonstrations of disgust for American arrogance....YAY!....Thinning our national forests by issuing the contracts to major lumber companies because "fire is bad".....YAY!  nope.....the economy has nothing to do with politics that I can see!

===message:Changes to the market economony contributed to the nullification crisis by the decrease in value of the crop that made many southerns wealthy.  The cash crop of cotton had decreased in value and as a result many soutern farmer lost profit, and for some their farms.  This displacement for southern farmers maded them feel abandoned by their north. The tariff also contributed to the discontent of southerns.  The south felt as if the goverment had northern interest in mind.  Nullification was a way to target the fears and the discontent of South Carolinians who refuse to allow tariff to be collected in their state.
Today economic development shape political issue in many ways as well.  For example when the economy is good the president (barring any other controvesy) is seen with approval, however in times of recession and unemployment his approval rating goes down making it possible that he won't be reelected to office.  People also show there disconent with political leadership in much the some way they did during the Jacksonian era.  A good example of this was the 2000 elections where Republicans took over the House.

===message:High tariffs that increased the prices on imported goods which forced Southerners to purchased goods from the north which increased the profits for northern states infuriated  South Carolina because the farmers and planters were suffering economically since the price of cotton had dropped tremendously, and just an all around disdain of for the north since they were able to recover from economic woes quicker than the south is what caused the Nullification Crisis.  Ultimately, South Carolina saw the government unfairly assisting the north in economic growth by posing these tariffs on goods.  

Times where hard in the south.  Farmers and planters were no longer profiting from their cash crops.  And they were being ordered to pay these tarrifs when their state's economy was down.  Unemployment was high which added fuel to the fire.

Economic developement certainly play a major part in today's political issues in that politicians based their decisions on raising taxes versus lowering taxes, depending on the employment rate to the country.  When the employment rate is high, taxes are raised.  When the employment rate is dropping significantly from state to state taxes are cut.

===message:<b> According to Tocqueville, what was to blame for the Nullification crisis? </b> <P>
Tocqueville saw the preoccupation with forming associations and organizing groups as a main factor that led to the nullification crisis. Based on his statements it would mean that if  South Carolina did not have an established organization to highlight the plight of southern farmers and the effects of tariffs and the protectionism of  the northern economy the would not have been an effective outcry leading to nullification <P>



<b>How did changes in the market economy contribute to this crisis? In what ways do economic developments shape political issues today?</b> <P>

Basically the prosperous cash crop of the south was no longer what it was and the farmers and planters were feeling the pinch not only being unable to sell their products but also having to pay tariffs on essential goods that seemingly only benefited the Northern merchants and elite class. The eveident distrust of the northern government also did not help. <br>
Economic development is based on the political decisions made; this is very evident by the time and money spent on lobbying groups who push their agendas by supporting political candidates and policies with the sole intension of returned favors and monetary gain. The guise that lobbyists are for the people in the long run is nothing short of the protectionism that occurred in the 19th century. <br.> If a political ideology is not popular although being beneficial to economic development, is discarded as being none prductive.

The changes in the market economy that contributed to this crisis was the reopening of the channel of intercourse by which the produce of Europe was transmitted to the New World, the Americans thought it would be a good idea to impose a system of import duties to protect their manufactures(in which most of the south had no manufactures) and to pay off war debts.

These tariffs affected the southerners the most, "We have no objection to the North being enriched by our riches, but not from our poverty" (337). These new tariffs were forcing the southerners to buy goods from the North while allowing northern prices to rise. Changes in the market economy contributed to this crisis because the South depended on other nations for its trade. Due to the tariffs, these nations in turn reduced its sales and imports from America which hurt southern businesses.

My mother always told me, “Money makes the world go round.”  Furthermore, economic development shapes political issues today because in government money is power.

If the people feel that their representation is to blame the new person running for office using that particular crisis will get a lot of support.  It is easy to rally the American public behind a cause using the scare tactics that economic stability is being lost. Tocqueville wrote that Americans enjoy forming associations.
