===more:Could you call those who opposed ratifying the Constitution
'states righters'"? In what way did the Articles protect
the power of the states over the federal government under the Constitution? Do you think states should have more power than the federal government? Finally, do you think the Constitution went against revolutionary principles or fulfilled them?
