===message:I think the Great Awakening was so successful for a few reasons.  First, because of the prevailing "rules" of the leading churches in the time, it took people longer to be converted.  Sometimes months and years.  Also, there were obstacles in the way of some in becoming full fledged members.  So much so that there was the "Half way Covenant" to be a stepping stone to full membership in the church.  
The preaching of Whitefield and Edwards and others like them led to the creation of churches that offered "instant" salvation and less ritual.  This appealed to many people.  
As far as preparing the American people for a revolution... Essentially if you joined up with Whitefield or one of the others, you were "rebelling" against the Church of England/ the roots of the colonies.  It broke the ice for a breaking off politically as well.  
The long term consequences were perhaps that the people were now in a position to be self-confident with their new found conversion and more able to take a stand against the King.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The success of the great awakening is derived from idea that it expressed.  Everyone is equal, everyone has a free will, and God is merciful.  The messages presented by theses two evangelicals reached so many people because of their enthusiasm in the idea that everyone is equal.  The poor, the rich, the slave, and the slaves' masters were on a level playign field when God was concerned.
     With regard to the revolution, the Great Awakening prepared the hearts and minds of colonists by uniting them in the idea that each induvidual had a purpose, and when everyone is united in this idea, it is much easier to unite in other ideas as well, such as driving the British from the colonies.  
     Consequences of this time included factioning of the churches, and much more induvidualism that Calvanism once held in check.  While I do not agree with factioning of the churches(in most aspects), it promotes the ability to worship freely the way you want to.

===message:When I read of Whitefield preaching up and down the Atlantic coast, stirring people up into a fervor, I couldn't help but think of other religious rallies in American History.  Notably, I thought of the Scopes Monkey Trial, in which the religious conservatives pitted themselves against scientific minds.  As I read of the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment, I thought of these two groups as comperable to the two opposing sides in the Scopes trial.  <br><br>My discussion question for any who care to reply is this: Do you feel we've progressed since the Scopes trial in our manners of thinking as a society, or are we still where we were then?  Have many reached a middle ground, say, believing that God created an evolving world, or is the population more evenly divided?  And how much more complicated is the country now, with Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, Atheists, and others making up significant portions of this country's population?

===message:The Great Awakening was a successful one to everyone especially with the help of the two evangelists Whitefield and Edwards. These two evangelists preachings was a successful one because their preachings gave everyone an equal right to worship in the same church both the rich, the poor, the slaves and their masters. It did not exclude anybody. It also allowed people to worship the way they want and also gave everyone the responsibility for his or her own salvation. It did what would favor everyone not only for some group of people. it also reduced the the rituals and changed the colonists minds. The Great awakening prepared the native Americans for a revolution and it gave people the full confidence to stand on their own without being scared of anybody and also gave them the right to stand before their leaders or king and oppose anything they said wrong.

===message:   Great Awakening was successful because It was a message that stressed equality in God's eyes. This message stressed that rich and poor,male and female , free and slaves should all be treated the same.
   Also this movement was successful because it was held outdoors on a weekday thus presented to multitudes of people.
   Both Edwards and Whitefield transformed the colonies by their religious and social movement which opened the way for a popular religion that was democratic, intensely personal, and humanitarian.They both stressed the human equality  before God's eyes.t
    The Awakening led the people to concentrate on looking at the inward-self and to scrutinize their hearts, which in turn encouraged individualism that would become a distinguished characteristic of American life.Some of the consequences of the Great Awakening were: strengthening of the colonies, religious denominations were then factionalized, and new educational instituions such as Columbia and William and Mary were developed. This was positive.

===message:The Great Awaking was so successful due to the colonists' thirst for spirtuality and the charismatic men who stated the rivals in the colonies.
The colonist who had suffered war, stuggles over land, and lack of employment where in need of spiritual leadership.  Many people did not have a enough religious guidance and the colonist suffered from the limited amount of preachers that were availible in the growing colonies.  The rivivals helped bring to the colonist more, or for many their first religious guidance through the sermons of energetic men such as Whitefield, edwards and Tennent.

The messages of Whitefield, Edwards and others were so appealing to the massing of people they reach because it was open for interpertation and the critized the system and the church officials who many colonist had become wary of.  
The message of these men could appeal to man or woman, rich or poor, slave owner or slave because the spokeput against issues without condemning the partice of them.  They spoke of the individual  challenging the system by looking inside themselves, but not to critizing the sociel structure itself. The message of the rivials were also less harsh the that of Calvanism which helped it appeal to more people.
When Whitefield and Tennent began to speak out against the minisrty in what they called unconverted ministry it appealed to many of those who were aready wary of the religious leader in their community especially in New England.  With it becoming harder for ordinary people to make lives for themselves and the heirarcy system in place it is easy to see why many would begin to critize the minisrty who held a high ranks in the society.

The Great Awaking prepared the colonist for the revolution by helping them look at the authority and to challege what they thought to be unjust or unfair.  

The long-term consequences of the Great Awaking was that it turned religous instutions on their faces while allowing the goverment to not take the blame for many of the colonists problems. It also encouraged the indivualism which proved hard to overcome in the on sight of the revolution.

The New World was not able to provide spiritual rebirth and change along with competitiveness.  Whitefield spiritual message reached so many people because it challenged authority but did not challenge the system that supported it.  The Great Awakening prepared American colonist for a revolution by encouraging individualism.  It also increased religious tolerance making the colonies the most Protestant, and most religiously diverse, population in the world.  The long-term consequences of the Great Awakening were religion in the colonies strengthened, religious denominations were fractionalized, and new educational institutions were established.  In my opinion the outcome of the situation isn’t really bad.

If someone says that something is going to make you a happier person you definitely want to hear what they had to say.  Things that came about because of the Great Awakening are things such as individualism and the acceptance of someone with different beliefs.  I think that people were really attracted to these ministers because they said exactly how they felt no matter what the cost.  They told their opinions with no shame or remorse and this was something that the colonists have not really been around before.  The colonists found happiness in what they were being told and there was no reason for them to "shy" away from it.

The great awakening was so successful because the people were able to come and listen and learn about jesus and salvation, and basically if you loved Jesus you would not go to hell. It gave people resassurance and direction. Instead of putting salvation on God, it was put on man. Although many different denomination were already established it was almost as if the great awakening went right through those barriers. As far as the message, I dont really feel that is was the message itself, as it was the way it was delivered. The way a pastor delivers a message has a lot to do with how the audience will respond. I think that this is why there were so many conversions. It prepared the colonists for a revolution because it broke barriers between religions although the barriers were still there it allowed them to come together without shame and congregate and confess their sins. The long term consequesnces of the great awakening were that the denominations were broken up in every different direction, it challenged authority as well as supporting it, most of the evangelist denounced slavery, which at the time was the wrong thing to do.  There was a break down in the "church" there is always going to be someone that doesnt want change, so there was the old church versus the new. Although there were many consequences for the great awakening I feel that more good than bad came from it.

Discussion Three

	I believe that the Great Awakening was successful during that time because people did not have knowledge about science, so they would make up explanations for things they did not understand by using religion.

	 Evangelist like Whitefield reached so many people because people were being to seek knowledge and they looked to high ranking members of the church to answers questions about the world. They reach people because they attracted crowds of communities. The most important aspect of attracting crowds was them not to persecuting the, and by not forcing religion on people it made them more willing to accept the messages being taught to them.

	By communities gathering together to hear messages from preachers the colonist began to identify themselves as a community.  Also as people would sometime follow or go to different colonies were messages were being taught, so the movement was began to cause the colonies  to come together. The most important aspect of the mass meeting was the unity it caused in colony communities, and religion was a choice not something forced by a high ranking government officials.

	Although, people thought during the Great Awakening period that being converted changed their life, they soon discovered that their conversion was only a temporary happiness.  The short happiness left the colonies seeking knowledge beyond religion.  The biggest tragedy that came out of this period was the innocent lives lost, because of people being accused of witchcraft on false premises.  This time period left many people open to the ideas that the all powerful God did not have all of the answers, and if he did not them they were sure that those on earth who said to be ruled by God definitely did not have all of the answers.

===message:The great awakening was a successful mostly because it occurred at the right time. The social climate of the colonies were ripe for a new thinking and indeed needed a revival of some of the old values that were lost but not a total reverting to them.  
<br>
The non-elite now had more time to think about issues other than just surviving in a harsh world, the slaves need some hope of betterment as well and were included into a movement which offered them some semblance of equality.  The elite were drawn in because the criticism of governance was just the right amount for them to accept and not feel threatened that they would loose their authority or worse of their slaves, their means to maintain their status. 
<br>
This prepared the colonists for revolution because they had a structured argument for self-rule and the enlightened concept that they could control their own destiny. 
<br>
The long consequences are of course an independent country, the establishment of a religious sect that continue to represent the disenfranchised today. An adverse effect however was that it justified the continuance of slavery for yet another hundred years or so.

Whitefield's message challenged authority but not the system that supported it. The people liked this tatic because he was saying something that they wanted to say and were not in position to.

Teaching the simplest ideal of religion, "The sinfulness of man and the mercy of God" (148). The message reached the citizens of the colonies that organized religions overlooked. It taught people, people from all classes to look within for the right decisions. The Great Awakening gave the citizens the opportunity to show individuality. That individuality lead the citizens to accept the feeling of not needing to be controlled by the British.
