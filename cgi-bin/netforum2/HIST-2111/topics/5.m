In the case of England's Parliament the so called "common" vote was minimal.

===message:One of the greater issues involved with the Stamp Act was that of taxation without representation.  The liberties Patrick Henry described were to be "free" to decide what taxes were needed and the issue of who would be taxed.  In essence, it should be fairly distributed.  If Parliament was doing the taxing, colonists whould be represented in the Parliament (which of course they were not) or the local governments should do the taxing.

===message:Why the people who weren't directly involved by the Stamp Act got involved is an interesting question...Perhaps because the printers of the newspapers and the publishers who were affected by the act used their papers as a vehicle to incite the public.  Maybe the lawyers who were affected were going to pass the taxes they had to pay onto their clients.  I think maybe the reason was the increasing feeling of ownership in the new colonies made the people more ready to rebel against anything that came from the English side of the Atlantic.

===message:What philosophical arguments did American colonists employ to justify their opposition to Parliament's actions? Who were correct, American colonists like Patrick Henry or Crown advocates such as Governors Glen and Johnson or Whately? What larger issues were involved with the Stamp Act? Why did people not directly affected by the act--the poor working men and women who formed mobs--inspired to protest against it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main argument was taxation without representation.  The colonists thought(and rightfully so) that taxes should be collected locally through colonial officials, with a representative watching out for their best interests.  Patrick Henry wanted this, asserting that throughout history there have always been people to "stand up" for their country(I took this as he himself almost declaring war on Britain by himself).  
Larger issues associated with the stamp acts were those of elitism.  The people collecting all the dues at the end of the day were representatives of Britain, and for the most part, being accelerated through the class structure at a rate that would bring red to the cheeks of a musket ball.
I disagree with the last part of the question.  I do beleive that the people of the "mobs" were equally affected by the taxes imposed by the empire. Cards, dice, and (i know most were probably illiterate, but) newspapers?  I don't imagine that the "eloquent" and "distinguished" members of society would be found a dark alley playing craps or poker for a week's wages.  And the thought of this gathering being broken up at gun-point by the ruddy good Kool-Aid man doesn't seem to set well with me, as it probably would not have set well with a conglomerate of drunken plowshares and blacksmiths having a good time.  The people of the colonies were united well before this time, known to them or not.

If certain men were not directly affected by issues such as the stamp act (for there were, no doubt, many who could not read a newspaper or had few, if any, dealings with lawyers), then what made them participate in the protests against this act?  <br><br>
I would venture to say that the power of oration had much to do with motivating the common man.  Powerful writing read aloud by educated, respected men in taverns and churches had a great deal of effect upon the majority of the colonists.  <br><br>
The same things move us today.  Good journalism: a well-written newspaper article, a well-written and flawlessly performed news report, or a well-written and powerfully delivered speech by a politician -- these all have the power now that they had two hundred years ago.  If used properly, words can captivate an audience, and after the capture, can persuade and then lead an audience.  <br><br>
In essence, the force that moved the common man was the power of persuasion, wielded by Adams, Henry, Hamilton, and others.  Collectively, they are given the title "founding fathers" for the importance they played in the movement of the American colonies toward a state of independence.

Like Henry gave an information on whom to tax and whom not to tax but his message was in vain. The British representatives were interested in collecting the taxes and the people chose to impose those taxes and also chose not to listen to any information that came from the British. And I do not think that the poor working men and women who formed mobs inspired to protest against it were not affected because they believed that it was the right time for them to stand face the British people and fight for their rights because they were ready to face anything that would come out of it.

I dont think that the poor people should have even been involved for the simple fact the tax had nothing to do with them. I think it was just the simple fact of majority rules.

Discussion 4
	Most of the arguments that American colonist used to justify their actions against the British came from John Locke’s theories about diplomacy.  William Pitt took the foundation for his speech about the Stamp Act directly from principles of Locke.

I would have to agree with Patrick Henry.  Although advocates like Whately argued the fact that most people living in Britain could not vote, Henry held the position that those who could vote had the right to nominate some delegates even though  the colonist did not have that right.

The most important issue that was directly placed in the Stamp Act issue was the fact that the colonist were being taxed without them having fair representation.

The poor was impacted by the  ideas their elite peers imposed on them.  The elite passed their knowledge and persecution of the British government on to the poor, which made the poor take on the elite issues as well.

===message:The philosophical arguement that the colonist used to justify their opposition was a theory called republicanism .  Republicanism was a set of doctrines dating back to the Renaissance.  The bases of these doctrines were that the few in power would deprive them people of liberty to make themselves more powerful, or that absolute power corrupts absolutley. 

There is no clear answer as to who was correct the colonist who lobbied for equals rights under the Bristish constitution or the loyalist.  On one hand the colonist were not being fairly represented in the Parliment who felt it just to tax the colonies without having officials from the colonies in Parliment.  However the govenors were doing their jobs, and supporting the crown who had just created a defiect fighting in a war the colonist had instigated.

The larger issues involved in the Stamp Act was that the colonist felt that they would not allow Britain to enforce upon them a tax.  The colonist felt that if they were not to be given the rights they felt were inherit to the under the British Constitution that they were going to oppose any taxation at all cost.  In many cases this meant boycotting imports and insighting riots.

The people who were less effectected by the the Stamp Act such as the poor working men and women formed mobs to protest against it because they too were tired of not being represented.  These were the people who were unable to get land in over populated colonies, and the ones who suffered most from the wars that took the lives of their sons, fathers and husbands.  They were the ones the least represented in the heirarical system that made it way to the colonies from Britain.  The working class people were fueled even more by their elite counterparts who knew that the faith and the support of the lower class was needed.  This mutual interest to seek freedom from tyranny diverted the stigma attached to the social class of the colonist.

They believed they also deserved the right of no taxation without representation in Parliament as did the Englismen did. It was a right that "was won through struggles with the monarch" (173). Of course the colonists were correct. This right was established long before and they had a right to it. The larger issues of course was control. The British didn't want to give up control and the colonists didn't want to relinquish their control. Even though the taxes was to pay for the huge debt incurred by the colonist during war, they beleived in the law that "no one should be subjected to laws or taxation except by duly elected representatives" (173). The people not directly affected by the Stamp Act protest against it because they didn't like that fact the British patronage enabled well connected families to hold numberous jobs and were able to collect the fees and salaries of all jobs held. That turned alot of the colonists against the monarchy altogether.

The colonists did not have any elected representatives therefore no one had the right to taxed them at will, especially when those collecting the taxes did so for their own gain. The “collectors” or enforcers were mostly imperialists who the colonists had no trust in and saw them as agents of the crown trying to control them.

The Stamp Act affected not only the merchants but also the common who would have to pay increased costs for the services he received. The larger issues around the Act was that it brought together all classes of the society under one banner, the fact that the many meetings that evolved out of opposition to the act laid the foundation for the unification of all the colonies and created what would become the basis of the American Constitution.

This philosophy lead to the refusal of taxation without representation. It's hard to imagine that Britain beleived it could enforce taxes on the colonies who were separated from them by an ocean.  Unless they were there physically, there was no way they could force the colonies to adhere to their rules and regulations as they had exspected them to.  

The colonists were right to challenge the Parliment on these taxes.  In the reading, it is clear to see that parliment exspected the colonies to foot the bill for the wars they thought was necessary to fight; for the sole purpose of expanding the empire.

The bigger issue concerning the Stamp Act was "Taxation without Representation."  Parliment was concerned with the interest of Parliment when imposing laws on the colonists who was not in attendance to speak on their behalf.  The rights of men were only in theory and not in practice.

The poor join the protest against the British as a way to display the disdain they had for the officials who made them feel less than citizens who deserved respect, and who was entitled the rights that the officials was accustomed to exercising.
