===more:It's clear from reading this unit on Grimké, Stewart and other abolitionists that both Northern and Southern whites held deeply rooted prejudices against blacks, both free and slave. In addition, Grimké also caused controversy and encountered opposition owing to her role in the abolitionist movement. How were the pursuits for black civil rights and women's rights linked? Why did Americans on both side of the Mason-Dixon line, North and South, oppose both?
