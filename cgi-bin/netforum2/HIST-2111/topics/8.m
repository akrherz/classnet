===message:At http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/book-sum/grimke3.html, one may find fifteen "Letters on the Equality of the Sexes 
Addressed to Mary S. Parker, President of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society," by Sarah Grimké.  Her writing style is both elegant and intelligent, a balm to the twenty-first-century mind that is bombarded with the idiocy of MTV and similar rotten bogs where intellect goes to die.  Here is a quote from Grimké:
<br><br> 
"The consequence of the fall was an immediate struggle for dominion, and Jehovah foretold which would gain the ascendancy; but as he created them in his image, as that image manifestly was not lost by the fall, because it is urged in Gen. 9:6, as an argument why the life of man should not be taken by his fellow man, there is no reason to suppose that sin produced any distinction between them as moral, intellectual and responsible beings. Man might just as well have endeavored by hard labor to fulfil [sic] the prophecy, thorns and thistles will the earth bring forth to thee, as to pretend to accomplish the other, "be will rule over thee," by asserting dominion over his wife....God created us equal; - he created us free agents; - he is our Lawgiver, our King, and our Judge, and to him alone is woman bound to be in subjection, and to him alone is she accountable for the use of those talents with which her Heavenly Father has entrusted her."
<br><br>
My words after those of Grimké are bound to seem coarse, but it is required that I add a little rhetoric of my own.  
<br><br>
The equality of women with men, and of African-Americans with European-Americans, was the subject of much debate in the nineteenth century.  The struggles of both downtrodden groups were linked not only by a shared plight but also by the manner in which they were viewed by the European-American men of that time.  Caucasian, property-owning males were those who commanded power and law, and it was reasoned that they were not merely those with the intellectual capacity for this task, but in fact were the sub-species of human most able mentally to master such studies and wield the reins of government.
<br><br>
According to our textbook, "many Americans...viewed women as a group as incapable of 'substantial and genuine virtue' and given to timid and irrational behavior" (229).  Similarly, "the anonymous author of...[an antislavery tract] argued that slaves were 'habituated, not to reason, but to obey,' and were 'not fit to be their own guides'" (228).  Here we see the link between the two causes: those in power viewed women and African Americans to be suited by nature to roles of subservience.  This attitude will, regretfully, continue to be prevalent for many decades to come.

===message:How were the pursuits for black civil rights and women's rights linked? They were linked because blacks and women were both oppressed as second class citizens.  It was this view that both movements were attempting to abolish.

Why did Americans on both side of the Mason-Dixon line, North and South, oppose both? For one, Americans feared giving blacks the same advantages because they felt that blacks would become intelligent, moral, religous, and as respectable and wealthy as whites. They were determined to keep blacks as low as they could.  Secondly, they felt that allowing women to speak out was going against Gods will.  They felt that women would not stay with the protection of man as God had intended it to be.

White men of this time did not feel that women were very logical thinkers and should not be allowed to be heard. Americans on both sides of the Mason Dixon line feared blacks and they felt if blacks were not oppressed then they had no idea what blacks would do or how they would act. Also,they did not want blacks to live by the same laws they did.

The pursuits for black civil rights and women's rights were linked because, they are considered to be the inferior race or species. Basically if you were not a white male, preferably with some land you were a nobody. Even a white man without land had more rights then the women and the blacks. I think the reason that everyone opposed was because you can only know what you are taught, and if you dont have the education or skills needed to back it up then you were still in the dark. Blacks and women both knew that they way they were being treated was wrong but because the men knew only what they were taught thats what they went by, its hard to teach an old dog a new trick. I think that we still have some of the same problems in society today, except for when black were the minority back in the day, they are the majority now, and whites are the majority. We still go through the same struggles today, except for the simple fact it is not just one race it is all the races. All people face some type of discrimination. If the world treated everyone as an equal we wouldnt be going through all this drama now

Americans on both sides of the Mason Dixon line, North and South oppose both because they were afraid of the blacks and thought that the blacks would have had another attitude if they were not oppressed. They were afraid that the blacks would become like them if not better so they were doing everything possible to make the blacks look inferior.

===message:Grimke, Stewart and other abolitionists that both the nothern and southern whites held deeply rooted prejudices against blacks both free and slave because the blacks and the women were oppressed due to the way they were mistreated. The blacks and the women were classified as low class citizens so people like Grimke, Stewart and other abolitionists decided to travel to places and speak out to the public in order to fight for the rights of blacks and women. Americans were afraid of giving the blacks the same equality because they felt the blacks would kill them and inherit their lands, or maybe become wealthier than them. Moreso, the whites also felt that the blacks would revenge them for mistreating them especially selling them into slavery. Finally, the whites felt that the duty of a woman is to bear children, look after the children, take care of the household chores, go to farm or cook. They did not believe that it is right for women to speak in public because they saw women as very emotional and weak people.

They  wanted to keep both the blacks and the women under their rule, to be able to dictate and govern them. The white women were required to be submissive to the white males at the time. Both the blacks and the white women were both viewed as second class citizens who did not have the right to vote or to exercise their own freedom. In addition, they were both oppressed and their freedom was limited.

The civil rights of black people and white women were linked, because they shared the same persecutor.  White women during that time wanted to be educated and have the same advantages as white men.  Black people were being denied their freedom, which prevented them from having advantages of white men.  Both groups were being denied what the American Revolution had fought for, and both groups had great influence during the war so they new the rights that they were being denied.  Those in power in the North and South opposed both groups in fear of losing control.  White men did not feel like women who were considered inferior should have the same rights as men, because the men in the family served the representation for the household.  White men also felt that women no matter how educated they became would never understand the complexity of the political system, and they did not need to waste their time learning about such matters since a woman’s only concern should be her family.  White men took a similar attitude toward black people, since they felt that black people were unable to be educated.  White men were so afraid of the unknown about the black race, that they made unfounded judgments based on ignorance.  In the North and South they felt it would be no need to free slaves because of the great benefits slaves had on the economy.  White women and black people during that period in history were being deprived of their constitutional rights, and instead of giving up they fought for their equality.  Although the fight for equality is not over the movement has had a tremendous journey, because as an African American women I can vote, work, and I receive my education in a Southern state that greatly opposed emancipation.

===message:The pursuites for blacks civil rights and women's right were linked because they were in many ways similar in their goals.  Blacks as well as woman were second class citizens of the United States during this time.  Even though white men were enjoying sufferage and a voice in politics, blacks and women were not represented.  Enslaved blacks and women were also seen as property.  Slaves as the property of their master. Women as the property of first their fathers, before marriage, an then there husbands (an example of this is how at common law rape was considered a crime against property).  Many women helped to form and conduct the abolition movement in the north.  Prehaps white women were more emphathic to the instituion of slavery do to their own restrictions and citizenship status.  Despite civil rights movements for both these groups would revive again in the sixties.
Americans on both sides of Maxon Dixon line opposed the abolition movement for severval reasons.  Southerns were opposed to changing their way of life.  Slavery was a very important part of southern ecomony and lifestyle. On the other hand many northerns relied either directly or indirectly on southern slave labor for their lively hoods.  On both sides whites thought of blacks as inferior to themselves.  Both sides also feared integration and the thought of blacks having domination over whites.  This fear in white Americans esclated to voliance with abolitionist the target of their rage.  This as with the  civil rights movements would continue to ignite violence, and create martyrs as people fought for equality in this nation.

===message:Women, Blacks and Indians all had the same oppressor and where expected to functionally in the white male dominated society. The Indians were oppressed for their land, the Africans were the mainstay for labor and women were relegated to the keepers of the home and child bearing. Each was considered “subhuman” as not worthy to be equals in society. The woman had the advantage of being closer to the ears of their men and had the luxury of being able to meet freely to organize their ideas. Coupled with being educated and some having wealth to buy favors etc, they had a better chance of advancing their cause. The slaves did not have these luxuries and has to seek their advancement more forcibly. <P>

The link really was seen when women were making known the injustices they faced also caused light to shine on those of slavery. At first the men saw the women movement as just a distraction for the women but once it blossomed into the possibility of threatening their labor force and based source of income it was no longer “cute”, but something to challenge.  It did not matter whether the men were from the North or South, their authority and imposed power was being challenged, obviously the had to oppose both movements

She was kept in a certain place in society and any deviation from that place would result in backlash.  Blacks were only allowed certain stations in society.  Any deviation from those would result in attack and sabatoge.  I find it hard to compare the two because white women were still allowed the status of their husbands wealth.

===message:The link between the black civil rights movement and the  women rights movement is that they both were denied the rights that white men were priviledged to have.  In an effort to obtain rights for one group would possibly pave the way for the other to occur rights that others had. They both were denied the right to vote, own property, and hold political office, therefore; not represented in congressional decision makings.  

The North and the South opposed women's rights because they viewed women as inferior thinkers compared to men.  If given the right to vote women would be inclined to vote as their husbands' point of view.  The North and South oppossed black's civil rights because they knew that blacks would gain in the areas of education, land ownership, and given liberties that white men enjoyed.  They viewed blacks as inferior people to them in every aspect, and not capable of associating in their societies as intellectual thinkers, and unfit to socialize within their environments.

===message:The pursuits for black civil rights and women's rights were linked by the public outburst of Grimke and Stewart. Both played a central role in opening up the "public sphere" to women of both races. Grimke was mostly for women rights and as a member of slave owned family she was only partially against slavery (anti-slavery) whereas, Stewart was for the rights of free and un-free slaves both men and women. It did matter which side of the Mason-Dixon line, North or South, back in the late 1800's males in general, regardless of their race were against women, regardless of race, taking on public roles.  Americans were against black civil rights because they feared that blacks would become intelligent, moral, religious, and as respectable and wealthy as their white counterparts so, they kept blacks in the lower class of society as long as they could. Americans opposed women's rights because the "public sphere" was for men only, plus women, in general were not entitled to have rights or opinions of no sorts.

White men were highly esteemed superior over all.  In a way women were inslaved to their husbands as blacks were inslaved to their masters.  They believed that blacks and women were inferior and had no voice or opinion that was important enough to be heard or considered.

I'm sorry I had to repeat the question..........

 The black civil right and womens right are both linked by the fact they both had to struggle for their equailty.  They both had to fight for their rights.  Americans opposed womens right becuase they thought women needed to provide for the family in the home and the public eye was for the "white man" only.  Also, they opposed black civil rights because they were afraid of what they could accomplish if they we allowed to vote and have the rights that the white man had.  They were afraid that the blacks would be more intellegent than them.

===message:The pursuit of black civil rights and women's rights are linked because their rights were never just given to them like the white male but had to be fought for and achieved. African Americans had no rights because the white property owners of the time didn't believe they were "civilized" enough to have such power. Women didn't have the rights of their males counterparts because they were required to maintain the household and bear the children. They weren't trusted with any political or business decisions. The Americans that opposed the equal rights of African Americans and women were afraid of what would change. They were afraid of losing control, their power. Their perfect little world would fall apart. They wouldn't have the labor of the slaves to cultivate and farm the plantations for them. Which in turn would decrease their wealth and their stature in the communities. They were opposed to women's rights because most felt women couldn't make sound decisions anyway. Many men and women alike felt that the woman's place was in the home and behind her husband. Not mingling with others fighting for a cause.

......................................  Both African Americans(free and slave) and women were viewed as sub standard citizens.  As we read in earlier chapters, men thought of women as not needing education because their place was in the home, performing tasks "suitable" for them.  African Americans were not to have an education either due to the fact that they were viewed as not citizens but barbarian like people with no need for an education(even those who had an education were viewed as sub standard citizens)  All in all, they fought together against white males who fealt threatened by equals that were not of the same sex or race, and by those who are frightened of change.

The pursuits were linked because they both were fighting for something that was looked down upon.  A womans place was in the home, taking care of the children and things that the husband needs done and a black persons place was on the fields working for their master.  These ignorant views of early Americans linked these two very different concepts.  Another reason that I believe that Americans opposed them was because it was something new.  People are always afraid of major changes and they didn't want to try anything that would change their "normal" way of doing things.

===message:Black civil rights and women's rights were similar in that neither group had voting rights. Neither group was allowed to be educated. Women were treated as second class citizens and Blacks were treated as less than human as was evidence by their being counted as three fifths for representation purposes. Women's rights were opposed because men wanted to feel superior. A woman was accused of wanting to be a man if she was assertive in any way. 
Southerners were opposed to Black civil rights because they would loose their free labor. They deemed the work too hard without any help and didn't think they should have to pay for the labor. Some northerners feared the loss of their job to purhaps less expensive labor. The need to feel superior was a reason, as well.

===message:During that time a certain way of living was established and that included women having no real part in society unless it was at the side or behind their husbands, fathers or brothers. As far as slavery went it was the backbone of the southern economy. And to some extent slavery was important to the northern economy as well. Both women and slaves were unable to have real freedom. With the liberty that was written into the constitution not applying to either of them it must have been quite ironic. But with the women because they were white they had a little bit more of a chance to actually have the talked about liberty that supposedly is for all peoples. So the subordination of both women and slaves to white males is how they were linked. I think for slavery it was mainly the economic consequences that made those who had the real power to setback change do so. With women I think it was more of an attack on the established system that made people oppose, even women themselves.
