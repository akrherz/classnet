<br><br>
I think that the attitude of the European states that colonized the Americas was one primarily of greed; riches were to be obtained for Europe at any cost.  Natives were treated shamefully, and in later centuries, descendants of Europeans living in the Americas were treated disrespectfully and unequally by the powers on the other side of the Atlantic.  This facilitated the cultivation of resentment that has lingered in some countries longer than in others; European states and peoples are often viewed by inhabitants of the Americas as arrogant (This holds especially true in South America, where more rigid levels of class and social structure were imposed upon non-Iberians).  The United States, specifically, came to embrace a spirit of newness and freedom with a wild fervor quite unlike the (stereotypified) traditional, monarch-revering Britain.  In the future, the United States will most likely continue to go its own way, continuing westward without looking back to "Mother England" for approval or support.

===message:WARNING: THIS IS LONG....I PUT THE QUESTION IN THERE FIRST SO I WOULDNT FORGET WHAT IT WAS

Europeans "discovered" America only in the sense that earlier they didn't know it was there. Native Americans certainly knew. How do you think history would have turned out had Europeans never discovered America and invaded its lands? 

In this case you have to take the good with the bad. It was the work of the Europeans that introduced all the areas to each other. When they infilitrated the lands, they did a lot more than just invade. They brought disease, which "proved far more deadly to the Indians than acts of warfare or cruelty." I think the Native Amercans would have much rather fight the Europeans than to just be killed off by their diseases. After a certain amount of time, Europeans immune systems were able to fight the diseases naturally. Whereas the Indians, the disease came in and killed off most of their population. If the Europeans never discovered the land, I think it would be a lot more peaceful. At the same time there would not be as much diversity between the people. 

If you could speak to a Spanish conquistadore (like Cortes), what would you say to him? 

Cortes destroyed one of the greatest empires of our time. If I could speak to him face-to-face, I would say that he was wrong. If he wanted something why didnt he just ask? He used deceit to get what he wanted from the Aztecs. The Aztecs thought Cortes was some type of god. All they did was shower him with gifts and praise. Cortes used this to his advantage. He took their daughters, their belongings, just everything. Once he got what he wanted he destroyed the whole empire. I feel like he took the cowardly way out. He destroyed people who wanted nothing more than to praise him.

Finally, since Europeans exploited the Americas, what does this fact say about the history of the United States and its future? 

Not much has changed since the Europeans. The only reason they exploited the Americas was becasue they were full of greed. They wanted what they wanted, and it did not matter who they enslaved or killed to get it. What this says about the United States and its future is that money is the root of all evil. You see peoples true colors when money is involved. I think racism played a big part in the explotation of the Americas, because if you were not European, you were treated dirty. I think that is wrong, everyone should be treated the same way regardless of the situation.

The Chinese had rounded the southern tip of Africa from the east before the Europeans had done so from the west.  Had the Chinese beurocrats not called a halt to further explorations (which consisted not of a handful of ships, like Columbus's did, but rather of hundreds of ships and thousands of men), the Chinese might have arrived in Portugal rather than the Portuguese arriving in China.  The Europeans might have been so preoccupied with the situation with China and emulating the route they took around Africa that they might not have attempted to sail westward.  The native Americans would not have been interrupted for at least a few more years; the Chinese may have sailed northward and discovered Alaska and the west coast of the Americas.  They sill would have brought smallpox and the other diseases that were present in the old world and not the new, however.  Biologically, the catastrophe was unavoidable.  <br><br>It is impossible to say with certainty how the Chinese would have treated the natives, though, compared to how the Spanish behaved, but an educated guess can be made.  The Chinese probably would have had no interest in the native Americans.  Nothing the Europeans had to offer for trade was coveted by the Chinese after contact was established; the Europeans were always the ones pursuing trade in order to obtain silk and porcelin.  If the Chinese had come into contact with the stone-age civilizations of the Americas, they probably would have had little or no interest in what they found there.

Nothing has really changed since the europeans exploited the Americas. The europeans came with the mind of invading the land and getting what they wanted, and that is exactly what they did. It did not matter to them who they destroyed. They needed to satisfy their hunger for greed. United States as I see will be a place where one will have to have alot of money before he or she can do what he really likes. money will take control over everything. Without money one cannot do anything. This will then prove peoples behavior when it comes to dealing with money.

Money is the root of all evil so people of the United States need to know that if we follow our greedy side we will destroy other people without having any remorse. like the europeans they had no pity on anyone,they just wanted to satisfy themselves

===message:Had the Europeans never "discovered" America and invaded its land, I believe the Native Americans would certainly have had a better chance today in their own country.  It is quite ironic that they are not the majority of this country. It would seem only natural that they would be. But they were killed off and treated so badly, and the influx of Europeans in this country put them at a serious disadvantage. The invasion of the Americas was not in the advantage of the Native Americans.  Columbus stated in his diary that he thought the people on the island would make good servants, and it would be easy to convert them to Christianity.  This speaks volumes as to the lack of respect that the Europeans had for the natives.  I can't say what the history of America would be had the Europeans not invaded this country.  But I can assume that the history of the Native Americans would have been a better one for their people.

===message:I don't know how to answer the if the Europeans "never" discovered the Americas.  That was inevitable with man's curosity, need for adventure and the invention of ships.  The Americas is just too big to sit out in the world & not be discovered. I think even if it had happened 100 years later, the outcome would have been the same simply because the rest of the world was more technologically advanced and the same diseases would have been introduced to the Americas.  Maybe another country would not have been as brutal as the Spaniards, but I think it is a part of man's make up to "get what you want" power & control.

As for Cortes, I would want to tell him he should be charged with war crimes.   

Last, but not least....I find it interesting that today as the Europeans did in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, we get the disgruntled and political opponents to join in with us before a major conflict, such as the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan and the Kurds & Shiites in Iraq.  There's also another similarity.  Although I think the United States government had an obligation to its citizens to attack Afghanistan, we seem to feel the need to use the guise of being morally superior such as all the concern our govenment had about the terrible way the women in Afghanistan were treated.  Did anyone hear our government discussing their demise before we had a need to attack Afganistan? I think that is similar to the moral supremacy of Spain's converting the Indians in order to save their souls.

===message:I believe it would have been a matter of time before the Europeans "discovered" and conquered the Americas. The Europeans at that time were seeking out the riches of the world known to them. They wanted the gold, the beautiful fabrics, and spices they had heard so much about. In order  to gain those riches they would have to conquer and control the native people. The Europeans went into these foreign lands under false pretenses. They gave the impression that they wanted to trade and all they ended up doing is kelling and stealing. They robbed and pilaged the natural resources until there was none left. Look at the Carribean Islands and Africa today. The largest diamond mine in the world is owned by Europeans but it is located on the continent of Africa. Most of the Carribean Islands are at poverty level or below because the Europeans robbed them of all the natural resources. They then gave the countries their freedom. Now these countries have their freedom from British rule, but have no resources to pull them out of poverty. It's cycle that needs to be stopped. 

If I could speak to a Spanish conquistadore, I would tell him of the havoc that his greed and curiosity has put on the native people of the lands he so called "discovered". Just because they are different doesn't mean they are unhappy. They do not need your religion. They do not need your type of societal rule. These native people have flourished in their own lands and will continue to do so without your influence.

Since the Europeans exploited the Americas and settled in the United States. They have generational lines that still feel the need to rule and conquer over people not like themselves. People they feel that are less fortunate. Again, they have to remember not all people strive to be rulers over others. There are groups of people that are different and exept those differences. They are able to co-exhist without one ruling over another.

Living peaceful lives with their own way of life.

Nobody's way of life should be forced on another, especially on their own territory. If I could speak with a conquistador, I would definitely tell him that you will reap what you sow. No one gets away with destroying lives and causing harm and deceit on another. When you do harm, harm comes back to you seven times greater. I believe that the U.S. has reached such a level of confidence and the need to show its power and control, that sometimes it can lead the entire country into danger, we all have witnessed this.

Finally, the actions taken by European explorers and conquistadors brings up a valuable question about the future of the world.  What happens when there is nothing left to explore besides those of outer space and the deepest oceans?  The world is alot closer knit than it used to be.

The fact that Europeans exploited the Americas says that the history of the United States is surounded by injustice and subogation of people who are not European.  When the Europeans "discovered" America and began to exploit it to gain profit for the Old World, it open up Panadora's Box sort of speak.  The Native Americans were pulled into a global economy that exploited its people, destroyed there culture and stole and pillaged their land. This  exploitation only increased as the reach for gold evaded them and the realization that cash crop could return a quick profit.  The tyranny expended accross the ocean to Africa as the slave trade gross in importance and profit.  Simulaneously two types of people were have there cultures degraded for the sack of profit and wealth for another land.  This set the stage for centuries of turmoil, in the Unite States and aboard.

Discussion One

	If the Europeans did not claim discovering America eventually another group of people would have found North America.  History would have been different only if the country that found America had different ambitions not of greed and religious purification for the Native American people.  History would change if the country that found America respected that Native American people owned the land and had their own culture.  I do not believe that history would have been different, since during those times each nation was looking out for riches to build their country no matter the cost.  By Native Americans not having the motive of mercantilism their culture left them open for conquest.

	To Cortes I would say to have some respect for other people, and their religious preferences.  The one point I would try to make him understand is how religion should not be used as an excuse to disrespect people, conquer, and diminish their treasures.  If I could say anything to him it would be to  treat the Native country like his native land Spain.

	One thing can be said about American culture every Thanksgiving and Christopher Columbus day, and that is there are a great deal of lies that shape our culture.  The truth has been known for many years that Christopher Columbus did not discover America, however in this country year after year a day is named in his honor for his great discovery.  To me the biggest lie comes around every November, with the turkey and other lies of how Native Americans shared a wonderful meal at harvest time with the Pilgrims.  If we had to celebrate the Native Americans feeding the colonist it would be an almost everyday celebration of how they were constantly making some type of provisions for the colonist.  To me this country has never respected others who were different, and that is why in the year 2003 as a Black Female living in this country I have to deal with discrimination.  Until the truth is told and lies spread in history are written telling the truth division and inequality will continue to be a problem in America.

While Europeans claimed America, the exploitation of this land continues, and has always involved numerous continents, not just Europe.  America is a product of globalization, therefore Europeans should not take the full responsibility for the harm done to America's resources. It is very unfortunate that Native Americans were mistreated during the colonization of America.  This fact is regrettable, but it has occurred over and over again throughout history all over the world when lands experience shifts in power, and war.  If I were to speak to a Spanish conquistadore like Cortes I would have pleaded for better treatment of the natives, but I could have said nothing to him that would have prevented the exploitation of America, because the true exploitation of this land began many years later around the time of the Industrial Revolution.

I would ask about motivating forces that compels someone to take a life because of a rapacious appetite. I would ask Cortez to present a convincing argument for acceptable stealing and murder.
Since Europeans exploited America, America exploited others. Europeans modeled the behavior and America learned well. However, countries are no longer allowed to just destroy and pillage anymore without consequences. Many innocent people lose their lives over these consequences, though. Because of these consequences, America has become vulnerable whereas it once seemed invincible.
