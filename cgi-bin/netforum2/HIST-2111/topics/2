===more:Europeans  "discovered" America only in the sense that earlier they didn't know it was there. Native Americans certainly knew. How do you think history would have turned out had Europeans never discovered America and invaded its lands? If you could speak to a Spanish <i>conquistadore</i> (like Cortes), what would you say to him? Finally, since Europeans exploited the Americas, what does this fact say about the history of the United States and its future?
