Surely one could call antifederalists "state's righters" or even to a further extent, "my righters."  They were concerned that a strong central government would impose such restrictions on liberty as did the British pre-revolution, limiting the rights that they thought they had to own slaves and trade as they wished.
The Articles of Confederation did no more to protect the states' rights than it did to enforce national policy.  This "protection" of states' rights was only due to a lack of control from a centralized government that had in no way the right to regulate.......well.....anything!  States were printing their own money, imposing their own regulations on trade(which varied from state to state), and this caused much unrest in the colonies which the national government could do nothing about!
I do not think that states should have more power than the national government.  Things seem to be going pretty well to me.  I don't know in any moral case where the government would come in and restrict some of my rights as a Georgian..........maybe tell me that I could not eat peaches?
The Constitution most definately did not go against the principles that sparked the revolutionary war, after all if there is NO government, then what do you have? Anarchy.  Thomas Paine said "government in its best state is a necessary evil."

The government could ask for money, but it had no way of making the states pay their share.

===message:Those who were opposed to ratifying the Constitution could be call "state righters," because they felt that the interests of the state may be overwhelmed by that of a federal goverment.  The last thing the colonist wanted was to go back to a oppressive goverment. However, those opposed to a national goverment were not able to see th "bigger picture" in terms of running a country.

The Articles protected the rights of the states over the ferderal goverment in the Constitution by creating a system of checks and balances that ensured that no one brach of the federal goverment would get too powerful.  It also allowed for each state to have representatives in the two houses of the ledislative branch (2 from each state in the senate, and a number equal to population or wealth of a state in the house).  State goverments also keep certain rights that federal goverment could not impede in.  The first amendment of the Constitution also granted a enormous amount of protect to the people of America more than any nation before it.

In my opinion I do not feel that the states should have more rights than the federal goverment.  I feel that had our natinal goverment not aquired the amount of power that it has many positive things such as the civil rights acts may have not occurred.  Though the founder of the Constitution may have never dreamed of the power that our federal goverment has today I think it would make them proud to see that their system has worked in many ways for many people (even those who it may not have been intended to work for).  

I believe do not believe that the Constituion went against the revolutionary principles, I believe that the constitution was the best rememdy for the new and troubled nation.  Those who were opposed to it had valid reasons to be however their position did nothing to help the needs of the people in the country.  The Constitution gave the fundemental rights that John Locke spoke of to every free, white man in America (and eventally minorities and women as well).  The Constitution insured rights and allowed for growth and amemdments with representation for each state.  The Constitution and it's blueprint of a federal goverment was the least oppressive system that could have been created.  The people who were opposed did so out of selfish reasons, not out of interest of the people as a whole.

1. I dont think the people are necessarily called state righters, but it all goes back to the same principal of being afraid of change. Just like in the witches imagination section. People fear what they dont know, these people came from a place that was under tight scrutiny of the government. This is something there are trying to avoid at all cost. 
2. The most important safeguard for the articles were the aspect of checks and balances, no one could be higher than another person. Then of course, the represenatives, the three branches, executive, legislative and judicial branches. 
3. No I do not think that any one state should have more power than the federal government. One of the reasons that I think this should not happen is that it would depend on the people of that particular state as to what would happen. What would happen if the state cannot compromise what is going to be done? Who are they supposed to contact? If the state is self-contained then one person is higher than another. Why would someone listen to another person about what they can and cannot do in that state. It's like this a person is more likely to listen to what implications the president has set rather then listening to a dog bark. A state reperesenting itself is like hearing a dog bark, at first it seems like they are trying to protect you, then it just gets annoying.
4. I think the constitution was fufilled. It is what today's society is based upon. Obviously something was done right. Most of the decisions that happened during this time are the same decisions that are used now. The constitution set out to do exactly what it planned to do, and that was to create a nation that would ensure liberty and economic growth. I think it did that and then some.

     The article of confedration did not provide for an executive central goverment due to the myopic views and constant pressures from the "state righters." They eventually got the powers for the states,but the ceremonial central goverment did not work.

In one way states could have been seen as righters.  In many was the Articles protected the rights of the states over the federal government, which is why they proved to be so weak.  Under the Articles the federal government had almost no power, and if they had went into affect with out being changed the states would have been self governing.  There is no way that the states should have held more power than the federal government, and if a new government did not go into affect the states would have fought many civil wars.  In some ways the Constitution did go against some of its revolutionary principles, but it
had to in order to establish some type of new government.  During the time which it was created, I believe that the Constitution offered the best solution to the United States government at the time.

===message:The rebellion against England was not merely against a powerful government; rather, it was fought against taxation without representation.  "Virtual representation," which the colonies supposedly had in Parliament, simply did not serve the practical purpose of allowing colonists to voice their opinions and concerns through due process in the English legislature.
<br><br>
The prevalent economic theory of the age was, of course, mercantalism.  The measure of a country's wealth was directly proportional to the amount of bullion held by that country.  The only manner in which a country could be made richer was by the acquisition of more bullion, and as the amount of gold and silver on the planet is fixed, the best means by which a country could strengthen itself while simultaneously weakening competitive neighbors was to take bullion from other countries.  Thusly, the English pirates who preyed on Spanish galleons came about, and the French and English fought each other incessantly on the high seas and in both the new world and the old, as well as in the far East, for control of global trade routes and economic supremacy.
<br><br>
The role of a country's colonies, according to mercantalist theories, is simply to serve the economic purpose of the mother country, and the manner in which it is to do so is twofold: by supplying raw goods and by providing a market for manufactured products.  
<br><br>
Obviously, the colonists had a different view of themselves by 1776; they were interested in empowering themselves, not in empowering England.  Thus, we have the stage set for revolution; the formation of a central government was not contrary to the motives underlying the American War for Independance.  The revolutionaries were not anarchists who wanted to abolish all government; neither is the opposition of tyranny the negation of any and all central government whatsoever.  Most of the politically learned revolutionaries realized that global survival alongside European nations with powerful central governments would necessitate a central government to oversee the nation as a whole.  
<br><br>
We certainly would have had a vastly different history if the states' rights had remained supreme to any central government.  What is today a (or perhaps the) superpower nation on this planet would instead be a second version of Europe, a collection of relatively small countries, each completely independent of each other.
<br><br>
That's certainly something to think about.

<br>
Yes. At the time of the ratification the only unifying thread between the states was that they had a common enemy. They were still self-seeking capitalists who were bent on seeing their own states as the leading trading ports. The mere fact that they already had their own constitutions leads you to believe that once the British were defeated it would be business as usual – each operating as it’s own entity.  I also believe that some still had the fear that a central government would only be a replacement of the monarchy by the now American elite. <P>
<br>
<B>In what way did the Articles protect the power of the states over the federal government under the Constitution?</B><BR>

The main clause that protected the states was that there had to be a general consensus before any act of congress could be done. <P>
<br>
 <b>Do you think states should have more power than the federal government?</B><P>
<br>
No. This be tantamount to a feudal system, a major step back and would eventually end up with what we see in Europe where each little serfdom started declaring themselves a separate country. <P>
<br>
<b> Finally, do you think the Constitution went against revolutionary principles or fulfilled them?</b><P>
<br>
A big yes. Although the underlining  reason for the revolution was purely economic, the leaders used the guise of liberty and freedom as a rallying cry. However, in the first draft of the declaration of independence the clause that accused King George of forcing slaves African slaves on the colonies was deleted. [pg 190]. This was necessary because the colonists had no intensions diminishing there free labor force. <BR>They also stated that all men were born with fundamental rights – that would include the slaves and underclass that were born in the colonies. They stated that if all people were n the same then they had the same rights, this is why the slaves could not be class as people but rather as livestock and farm equipment. Also the claim that government should represent the people but a representation of the majority of the people was not included in the discussions. Instead it was the land owners and businessmen whose interests was to be protected.  These are just a few  examples of the hypocrisy that existed.

The Articles protected the power of the states by insisting that there had to be an overwhelming agreement in order for laws to be passed.  It provided checks and balances of power to ensure a system created in Europe would not exist in America.

States should not have more power than the federal government. It would cause too much turmoil from state to state.  For example, if states had more power, abortion would be legal in some states and illegal in others, depends on which state favored abortions and which states didn't.

That’s because their main reasons for not wanting ratification was because they wanted to keep the political power within the states instead of with an outside central government. Which is understandable, who would want to give up power which when in use will personally affect you? By giving judicial authority and allowing authority over a state’s constitution by their federal courts, the articles protected the power of the states. The Connecticut Compromise also protected the powers of the state. Instead of feeling as if smaller (population) states were lead by the larger states all had an almost equal degree of say in how power would be used: such as collection of taxes and the regulation of foreign commerce. I tend to be a fence sitter myself so it’s hard to say if the states should have more power than the federal government. It all depends on the circumstances of the time. I believe that there needs to be a balance of power between the two. The federal government could unwittingly pass legislation that would be detrimental to individual states but have a positive effect on others. Without the individual states having the power to challenge those legislations nothing could be done. Then again that can lead to a whole other set of problems. If each state is somewhat balanced with the federal government when it comes to power they would have the ability, if they ever felt like it, to constantly disrupt governmental actions. The constitution both went against revolutionary principles and fulfilled them. When it came to human equality it without a doubt went against revolutionary principles. Then with representation of the people it fulfilled them

	One way the Articles protect the power of the 
States over the federal government under the Constitution is by creating a system of Checks and Balances that ensured that no one branch of the federal government would become more powerful then another.
