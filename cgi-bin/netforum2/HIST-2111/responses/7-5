===message:I totally disagree with Candy on how economic developments shape political issues today.To start with,there is no job stability these days. The only labor sector,according to the statistics in the press, that is growing today is the unskilled job.Tax reduction is a sign of negative effect of an unsound political decissions on the economy.The facts that we have had deficit in the budget and we continue to compound the deficit tells ordinary people like you and I that the politicians are not doing what they promised to do.Economy does not prosper when the poor are getting poorer and the richer widening the gap.
The situation today is that of the survival of the fittest in almost all ramifications of the economy.

===message:I do agree with Candy on her issues. I think she is exactly right. I think that Mukaila was misunderstood with Candy's comments. Candy only stated that politicians will do as they wish. She never specifically stated that they give us job security or reduce our taxes. You can never help what happens with our economy these days but only handle what is thrown at us. No one is responsible for us not feeling like we don't have job security. Especially not the politicians. They cannot help what happens in and from other countries but only try to make things better for us in the future. We are also reponsible for ourselves. Even more than other people are for us. We have the power to make great lives for ourselves and if everyone was on the same page we would not have any of these issues to begin with. We cannot blame others for our problems. I also aggree with all of Mukaila's comments but I just think that Candy was misunderstood in what she wrote. She jusy believes that economic development does help shape political issues today whether good or bad.

===message:I do agree that economic development helps bring  about peace because when there are jobs in the government then it means that the government becomes more stable and secure.Reducing the taxes then allows the low income based citizens to become more secure.

===message:I agree with Lydia, I believe when the economy is good people do feel safer.  They tend to make more and inturn to send more.  This does shape political issues because without out excess spending there isn't a good flow of money going through our capitalist system.  President G. W. Bush tried to help spur our economy by cutting taxes twice.  His reasoning was in hopes it would revive spending.  On a personal note I hoped it would do just that. I was one of hundreds of people that got laid off in Georgia this year alone do to the bad economic time we are having, and the lack of consumer spending.

===message:Thank you Nicole for making my point clear to Mukaila. i just said economic development helps shape politics no matter how good or bad it is.  Although politicians do not do what they really say, having a better economy shows some improvement in politics. we cannot always have things our way and that is how politics is. they say they will do what we want but hey they don't.
