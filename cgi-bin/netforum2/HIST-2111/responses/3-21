===message:I admired the religious believed, and how people stood up on thier believed, but some people used it in thier advantance.  That made people that were involved in the churches in get away with more stuff.

===message:WOW I cannot believe that nobody believes there were witches but me, I do think that there are witches. Some people say that halloween was made so that the companies and manufacturers could make extra money, I agree with that but I do believe that there are witches in the world. Well at least I think so. Just in case yes I believe in ghost, and wilder beast too.
