===message:I agree with most of the message with the exception of one thing. I don't believe the Native Americans allowed the Europeans to take over their land. I mean who would really allow what happened if they could help it right? I think it just happened and there wasn't anything that could be done to stop it.

===message:I believe that the Native Indians tried to fight back. Looking at the Caribs and the Tainos, the Caribs were aggressive people who tried to fight for their land and their wealth. That's why Colombus had to figure out another approach to defeat the Caribs of which he made the gift to one of the lieutenants but the woman resisted it. This shows how much the Indians wanted to keep their wealth.

===message:Yes, the exploitation was inevitable as nicole said,I also believe the whole expedition was a process of change which is ever so constant. It meant different things to different people that were directly or indirectly involved. As for the entire humanity,it marked the beginning of a new world of the survival of the fittest.

===message:Hey Nicole. I agree with you but at the same time you should know that this is my own opinion and it is what I felt so you do not have to think the way you are taking it. O.K let us face the fact now, if the Europeans did not come to America, all these wealth that the native Americans are controling now may not have reached them because those came with the help of the europeans but being that the native Americans allowed the Europeans to enter their country that's why they infected them with the diseases which they came in with.

===message:Hey Lydia. I agree with your point but remember that the land that the native Americans snatched from the Indians is not the altimate but if i happen to meet the conquistador, I would ask him about the innocent souls that were killed and not only that, i would also ask him about the women that were raped and how would he feel if his mother or any of his sisters were raped or killed. i mean that's mean and inhuman.

===message:I also agree that the Native Americans didn't exactly have a choice when it came to the invasion of the Americas. I mean honestly what could they have done differently? The Europeans at the time were much more powerful as far as weapons went and they had a completely different mentality. They didn't have gun powder or cannons and their weapons were not made of the same material. So if you have someone coming in to take your house and you have a frying pan and they have a gun who do you think is going to get the house? An example of the mentality would have been the concept of land ownership. I'm not sure if it was in this history book but they <NA> didn't really have the same type of idea of land "ownership". Also I kind of wonder what wealth was to the Native Americans. To most Europeans it was material goods or land but I don't know if it was the same thing for Native Americans.

===message:I totally disagree with you when you said that they could not do anything to stop the Europeans from invading. If they were that serious about thier wealth, they would at least try to fight back to get their wealth.

===message:Ayana, if they Americans certainly knew that they Europeans were going to invade their land, they should have thought about a way to stop them. I can understand if they did no have any clue or anything. Then, i would say that they were not prepared. Guns or no guns the Americans should have had a clear idea of what needs to be done to stop the Europeans.

===message:I do not agree with the idea that the Native Americans allowed the Europeans to take over their land without a struggle.The information given in the text shows that the Native Americans fought for what was theirs.The Europeans clearly had an advantage because of the weapons they used in the wars. The sticks and spears the Native Americans used were no match for the guns the Europeans had. There is also the issue of the plagues and diseases the Europeans brought to the Native Americans that nearly wiped out a tribe which in turn decreased the number of people available to fight.
