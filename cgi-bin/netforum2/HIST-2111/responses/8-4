===message:Hey Ronda. You made a good point here. I agree with your point that in today's society, the whites and the blacks are still having the same grudges which they had in those days and where there are too many white people, black people don't go there like wise the white people too. Although, the way the blacks and the women were treated then was horrible but we all should try and forget about the bad time and think about the good time because the bad time always bring problems in every society. I mean let us think about the future time.
