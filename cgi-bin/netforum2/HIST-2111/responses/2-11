===message:I do not believe America does everything out of greed. I believe America does some things out of necessity. I believe we are conquering others to help maintain our lifestyle. We destroy land to build homes for us to live in and businesses for us to work to support our families and way of life. If not for that where would we be today? I believe we only invade others when there is no other choice and when they have first invaded us. Some Americans might do things strictly out of Greed but not all.

===message:I completely agree with Nicole White on this one I dont think greed completely drives the US but it does play a little part in how our government works.  Certain approaches the US take are for our well being not out of greed.

===message:As a little girl in school your always-taught African American History at home or in school.  Learning and studying this makes me grateful for what I have accomplished in life. Many of my ancestors were not able to get a good education.  However, reading this text and learning about the Atlantic Slave trade and how African were transported to the Western Hemisphere. I think this way of making money was wrong.  Later, even the Europeans stopped having slaves. This was also around the time when Portugal  opened it’s trade with West Africa.   If Europeans saw it was not beneficial and very inhuman then why did people throughout history continue to try and make money off of this type of trade? For example all of the Indian tribes that were enslave and killed like Toltec Indians.  There were many many more people and cultures that became extinct because of the slave trade industry.

Was all this blood shade necessary?
