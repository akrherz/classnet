===message:I think that should be call a state righter.  The constitution protected the states by protecting the individual rights.I do not think that the states should be more powerful then the government because it can mess up the whole process of the equal rights. Some states might have an diffient ideas then another states and it would creat much more problems. The costitution fulfilled the principles.  It recgulate all the problems and give every states the equal rights.

===message:I do not think that they were state righters but I do believe that it was personal and they were lookin out for themselves.Of course they wanted all of the states to be equal because they feared advancement of the other states over them. I believe the Articles tried to make all the states equal, but I do not think that the states should have power over the  government. I think that the revolutuinary principles were fulfilled because we got the independence that thet set out to get.
