===message:Patricia, you really gave some good points and i agree with you on the fact that people are more sure of themselves and lessa friad when they are doing things on their own without anybody's help. And you made a good point on the things to consider when voting. i think everybody should know what it takes to vote for someone who will help the economy so you ca benefit positively from it.

===message:Some good points were made but I believe that we so often vote for someone because someone else says that this is the person to vote for especially the younger adults who are beginning to vote, this upcoming year I will be sure to know where all the candidates stand all issues presented, the only way to make the right decisions is to arm yourself with a vast knowledge of information.

===message:Good point Ronda.  Today people are starting to make more informed decisions about whom they vote for.  The majority of the time people vote on what they here on TV or from what their parents views where when they grew up.  Some of the typical sterotypes have been that the Democrats are for the blacks, Republicans for the rich, etc. And there are people who still vote this way (sad).  As you said, people should take the time to look at the candidate for the stance that they take.  Don't take the news media at their word.  With all the resources that are available today, it is much easier to research a candidate to get a real account of what the media portrays in the news.
