===message:For sure, it did more good than harm to give more power to the federal government than the states. You can imagine America which has so many states ruling themselves as they wish and no central government? I guess it would be chaos...we would not have a central government but maybe each state would be a government on its own.

===message:We definitely have to have some type of centralized government.  The US would constantly be in chaos.  There always has to be one authoritative body that looks out for the interest of all.
