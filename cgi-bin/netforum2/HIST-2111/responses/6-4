===message:Do you think the Constitution went against revolutionary principles or fulfilled them? It depends on who you are asking.  Anti federalists believed in the supremecy of the popular elected legislature.  Federalists felt that the key to liberty was balance.  So to Anit federalists the constitution went against revolutionary principles.  To Feralists it fulfilled them.
