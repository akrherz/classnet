===message:In my own view,I really admire the puritans for their early penchant for the development of knowledge within their fold.That singular act helped immensely in the eventual emancipation of the colonies.However,I find it very difficult to reconcile their purported piety with their apparent intolerance to other denominations,particularly the Catholics.
       The issue of witchcraft in Massachusetts Bay was a case of hallucination that was hyjacked by some mischief makers to further their evil machinations.This particular episode proved the hypocritical nature of some colonial believers.The furore was all about the figments of imagination of some "doubting Thomases" parading themselves as religious leaders.
