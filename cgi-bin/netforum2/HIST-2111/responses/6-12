===message:Hi Candy. I agree with you that those who opposed retifying the constitution were not the state righters. They were the anti-federalist because they were against the states asking for their rights and also the way the articles made the equality to be a thing of the central government instead of them to let the states control their states by themselves was wrong. so i strongly agree with you.

===message:Helen, I agree with you up to a point. But I don't think it was wrong of the Constitution to make all states equal across the board. If every state differed in Laws, we would have such a high injustice throughout the United States. We need to have that stucture in the government when it comes to certain laws.
