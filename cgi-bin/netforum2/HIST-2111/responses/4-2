===message:I agree with you Ryan that it gave everyone an opportunity to actually worship. I think the Great Awakening actually captured the reason for religion, a spiritual realtionship with God which every individual has the equal opportunity do and do somewhat differently.  It also gave the individual the responsibility for his/her own salavation which did not include an experience that someone else decided you should have.  I think The Church of England and Puritans were based on the good of the Church just like Great Britian was based entirely on the good of the country.  I think this contributed greatly to the ideas of the Revolution because every person should not only do what's right for their country, but also what's right for them as an individual.

===message:Hi Ryan. I think I really agree with you that people were allowed to worship in the church both the poor and the rich and i also agree with you that the Great Awakening prepared the mind and the hearts of the colonists by uniting them. Even the masters and the slaves were treated equally. I think you made a good point there.

===message:I think the best lesson that came out of the 'Great Awakening' was the unprecedented restoration of self confidence and esteem to the people who had been hitherto led to believe they were inferior just by virtue of their birth and background.It became very clear to the people that the concept of religion was a personal convenance with God, and that the church of England and the Puritans in many ways were still the extension of British imperialism and religious dogmatism. I think 'Great awakening' gave birth to the separation of state and religion that we all enjoy today, although some people are working very hard to undermine it. Hopefully, history will not repeat itself.
