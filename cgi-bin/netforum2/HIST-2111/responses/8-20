===message: I think the whites were not ready for the challenge that the African- Americans would create. They definitely knew that the African Americans inside them were smart and gifted and therefore if they allowed them education they would outsmart them and thus rob them of their many priviledges in terms of government jobs, and many other professional jobs.

===message:The black civil rights and women'right link because they want to be equal with the white men.  The blacks wanted to be consider human being instead of being treated like an animal, women wanted to be treated equal like their husbands.  They were facing the same purpose.  The women were only suppost to be at home, cook, clean, and taking care of the children.  They suppost to follow the husband. The blacks were suppost to be slave, they were not consider to be human.  In today world,  some things are changed.  Blacks are be coming business man, and doctors.  Women are going the work to support the family, but in some situation things are not changed.  For example, a man and a woman who have the same education, same qualifacation, but the men are getting pay more then women.
