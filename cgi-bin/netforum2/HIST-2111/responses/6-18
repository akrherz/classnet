But dont you think that the underlaying interests were their own preservation of wealth? Independence was a means to secure the wealth they had amassed at the expense of others and the willingness to keep that wealth was a compromise that in effect ratified the constitution. The State-righters  were just a bit more blatant with their efforts to keep an old system with a new name.
