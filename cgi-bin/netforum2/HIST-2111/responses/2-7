===message:I agree with you all thus far. It was devastating to a people that had lived in the Americas for thousands of years. There whole way of life had changed. They lost their land, they were made slaves, had a religion forced on them, died from unknown disceases and even lost one of their largest food supplies, the Bison. This whole devastation is a result of the greed that the Europeans had. On the other hand, there was some good that resulted from the intoduction of the Europeans. They brought guns and horses that enabled the indians to hunt more effectly. Bottom line is that a culture was destroyed in just a few hundred years and those that are with us today are trying to regain their culture again but it will never be the same.

===message:I agree with both of you.  The bottom line is that no one should force their way of living upon another. I am a Christian and definitely believe that this is the way, but I wouldn't dare force my spiritaul beliefs upon anyone.

===message:I believe that Columbus deep down just wanted to see what was out there, "discover" new lands. He, however, knew that those that backed him only did so as an opportunity to conquer and spread their empire. He was the scout for colonialism. He had a clear understanding in what would follow his travels – he called all the people he met beautiful but took advantage of their passivity and saw it as a means to further the greed of those to whom he had pledge loyalty.

“Finally, since Europeans exploited the Americas, what does this fact say about he history of the United States and its future?

The US now has its own modern day “Columbus” in the form of businesses that go to other countries to improve their economies by offering job opportunities and building infrastructures to improve a way of life.  This opens the doors to establish puppet governments, acquire cheap labor and in the long run change the way of life of these “third world” countries to where they are totally dependent on US goods and services. In return they can only get these services if trade tariffs are eliminated and the US has an open market there. Not only has this changed how these countries conduct business and with whom, but the effects culturally has actually changed in so many forms that ancient and beautiful lifestyles has been lost among the young; traded for Nikes and “technology”.

Columbus came in the name of trade and discovery. The US of today comes in the name of Globalization and advancement. In the end the results are the same – conquest and exploitation.

===message:I am in total agreement with Ian and what he said about Columbus and the US. I don’t think too many people understand how closely our foreign policy resembles that of Europe during that time. One of my biggest beefs (one from which ALL others stem) is our foreign policy. Ever since we surpassed Britain as an economic and political power it seems we have taken a condescending stand when it comes to dealing with other peoples. We feel that everything we do is the right thing and that we have every right to do it. That is exactly how the Europeans at that time felt and look what happened there. Yes there was of course a degree of good that came out of their actions. But the actions themselves were horrendous. I feel that if the US doesn’t stop and rethink its foreign policy we will have a bucket load of problems. It seems that history is only repeating itself (as it tends to always do). No one has to think hard to bring up the most recent example. And if you do … (shrug)
