===message:I agree that it might have been different if the Europeans never discovered America. But what we don't know is if it would have been better or worse. I believe that sooner or later it would have been discovered anyway. I agree that it might not have been so brutal but then again who knows? It might have been even more brutal.

===message:Actually when you think about the Native Americans treated other NA as inferiors, they treated other NA cruel, and they did go into other tribe's territory and just take over. And they certainly did not live lives filled with peaceful bliss. With the Europeans it was on a flippin HUGE scale. The cruelty was documented with writing and many many more people died, a good portion of the NA population was wiped out, but that was due to the diseases that the Europeans brought over. There is greed for wealth and power no matter what society you are in. But the extent of greed in this case came at a huge cost. So basically I'm saying that the NA were not living happy peaceful lives. They had just as many political power struggles as Europe but it was just different. It all depends on how you look at it. Do you get my point?

===message:I to believe that eventually the Americas would have been discovered by someone. I also agree that it was a brutal takeover. The majority of the killings were so senseless, and to wipe out a whole tribe because of your greed was uncalled for. The forceing of one's beliefs and religion on another is not the way to gain superiorty. I look at our world today and ask myself, is history repeating itself. It is my understandind that we are suppose to learn from our mistakes.
