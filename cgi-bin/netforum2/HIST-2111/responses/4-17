===message:I agree with you and wanted to add that The Great Awakening did in fact cause problems with the colonies. It prepared them, or should I say began the wheels turning for the want of freedom from control. If this wouldn't have happened, we (U.S. citizens) would be British citizens right now.

===message:The Great Awakening was everything to everybody! The emotions of George Whitefield was allowed to play on the emotions that the colonist had back then. They were under a control without a way out. This gave them the direction that they needed to go. It gave them the courage to be themselves, individuals. It also gave us the different denominations that we have today. It sounds like Mr. Whitefield was the Mega Church back then. It gave us college's.
