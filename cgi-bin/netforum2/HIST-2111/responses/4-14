===message:I agree with everything you said.  Your thoughts are interesting.  I think Whitfield was a hypocrit on the issue of slavery.  He justified it by believing the practice of owning slaves was acceptable as long as they were treated humanely.  Being an evangelist who called ministers on their inappropriate behavior, and being one who encouraged his followers with individual religion could not admit or see the evil in forcing another to labor for free, and be denied human rights given to a person by God that they often preached to their congregation is very hypocritical to me.  Please excuse me for veering off the subject.  I just had to point that out.

===message:Erica, I did see that with Whitfield and so far for many more of the men who stood up and spoke against many social ills but were maintaining them in their own households. This makes you wonder if there wasnt always another agenda..

I wanted to reply to Erica. Whitfield was not really hypocritical in his explanation of slavery. You have to try to look at by that times standards and not today’s. To treat your slave(s) with kindness or at least with a bit of humanity was kindness in itself seeing as that some people justified their actions by saying that their slaves were in fact not fully human, as you might consider a monkey. But if you were to not beat that slave and they work for you and you keep them and feed them that was treating them humanely. So he wasn’t exactly being hypocritical by having slaves himself as long as he treated his slaves humanely. I am in no way condoning slavery; I’m just looking at it from the other side.

===message:I agree with you, the Great Awakening did occur at the right time. The people wanted to hear that individuality would not be a threat to their spirituality. By blaming the Ministers for their religious woes instead of their own shortcomings it allowed people to be freer with their actions and to feel, as I see it, almost a sense of invincibility. If you do wrong religiously it is not your fault but the fault of your Minister. Their religion had started an evolution because of social changes that were going on. Then the basis of a relationship with God without the church leaders as intermediaries could also have been appealing. I think the message of maintaining their newly claimed individuality and yet still retain their spiritually is what most people found appealing. This I think allowed them to look past the common status quo within society and start to question the way things worked with eventually lead to the revolution. I think this is all a bunch of rambling but it made sense when I was writing it. The long term affects is the ability for most Americas to be totally self centered compared to their predecessors and feel no need to change.

===message:The great awakening along with many other things that shape our government and our world is like Ian said it happened at the right time and the right place. If you go all the way back from when everything started, Columbus did not really discover certain lands but because he was at the right place at the right time he was given the credit for it. Ian you made a very good point about being in the right place at the right time.

===message:I agree with you. I am in no way agreeing with slavery either but I think sometimes you have to take the good with the bad. I think that things are inevitable sometimes and if people make some good out of it then it is better than others making it all bad. He could have in fact treated them just as everyone else. This is good that others do think of things as good and bad.
