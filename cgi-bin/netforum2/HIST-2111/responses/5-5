===message:If I dont agree with you on anything else I agree with you on this one. You are right why would the poor people even be bothered with the whole stamp tax situation. They already have very little if anything at all, and its kind of hard to tax nothing.

===message:The argument of the colonists was based extensively on the principle of "constitutionalism" which is about the rule of law and the consent of the people.Patrick Henry and his contemporaries insisted there would never be taxation without representation.
    I think the larger issue with the stamp act was the British monachy's attempt to coerce the colonies into one single mordern state with full loyalty to the crown.
    Different classes of the colonial societies were mobilized for the protest in other to give the rebellion the much needed credibility and legal backing.The measure was also adopted to prevent some individuals from being labelled as enemies of the British goverment and consequently charged for conspiracy and treason.

===message:I think motivation for those unaffected really was principle. Yes they most likely would never be affected by the taxes but to allow parliament to tax the colonies was just not acceptable seeing as that there was no adequate representation. So any kind of mass movement of the underclass I feel can be contributed to the fact that they felt the crown had no business taxes the people of the colonies.

===message:I think you have some good proven points. I think people (even today) do alot of things based on principle whether they are directly affected or not. I think it is a matter of right and wrong and good or bad at most. We operate the same way today in many ways. I am not affected in any way by aids or breast cancer or any other health realted issue but I participate in walks and movements and charities ect. I do it for the principle and the future whether directly related or not. I think that things were the same back then also. Good point made.
