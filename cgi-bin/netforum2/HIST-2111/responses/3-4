===message:Ryan, I think you have a great point about the quest for religious freedom that brought people here in the first place and the irony that they would then be so puritanical (pun intended) about those who had different views or those who chose to practice witchcraft, if that is indeed what they were doing.

===message:I agree with you both on this issue. As I stated in my opinion, one of the best things about the Puritans was also the most damning for them. Religion. They took their beliefs to the extreme in every fashion. They took care of the poor and helpless, but then burned human beings at the stake. They became the Judges of their neighbors.

===message:The fact that the Purtians took care of the less fortune, orphans and widows showed how much they were decaited to their own kind.  I wish more Americans were like that today, were we looked out for one another regardless, of finanical class or family status.  I believe that would stop alot of the hate and crime among our generation. They would have someone reaching out to them would make a signifcant difference.
