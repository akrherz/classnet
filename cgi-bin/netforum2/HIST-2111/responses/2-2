===message:THE EUROPEANS WERE DEFINITELY OUT FOR WHATEVER THEY COULD GET. I FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE CAME UP WITH SOME TYPE OF AGREEMENT AS TO HOW TO SPLIT UP THE LAND RATHER THAN JUST OVERTAKE PEOPLE. THERE WAS PROBABLE A WAY THAT THEY COULD HAVE SPLIT THE LAND EVENLY. BUT KNOWING THE EUROPEANS, IT WOULD BE THE REQUERIMIENTO ALL OVER AGAIN. THEY WOULD COME TO THAT AGREEMESNT AND THEN THEY WOULD STICK TO IT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY WOULD FIND SOME TYPE OF LOOP WHOLE, LIKE READ IT FROM THE DECKS OF SHIPS.WHY WOULD YOU HAVE TO KILL SOMEONE TO GET WHAT YOU WANT? CANT WE ALL JUST GET ALONG?

===message: I totally agree, the Europeans were out to get whatever they could. To be fair they should have devised plans to split the land instead of taking over. I think they felt it was easier to kill than to share the land with the people. To share and have to discuss sharing the land with the people would have been too much of a bother.

===message:If I could meet one of the Europeans, I would ask why they had to be so mean to the Indians to get what they wanted.  It makes no sense for them to have treated the Indians so badly.  I would also ask them how they would feel if someone were to come to there home and do the same thing.

===message:I think Cortes made a huge mistake when he slaughtered the Aztecs. He had a young indian madien that acted as his translator and could open many many doors for him. This was like having a person on the inside. Instead, he destroys the city and leaves it in ruins. What does he have to give to his king now? I believe I would ask the Europeans, Was the silver/gold and crops worth the number of lives that was taken?

===message:Sherry the only answer to that question is that the Europeans were greedy and they wanted to improve their economy. That was why they invaded American. And for treating the indians, i might say they were mean and at they same time, it might be more than that.
