===message:I do not agree with Ryan that Antifederalists were "State righters" or "my righters" as he chose to phrase it.Antifederalists were only fighting to protect the old order that was doomed for extinction.It was crystal clear from the beginning that these were self centered people,highly opinionated and would not see things in the perspectives of development,progress and diversity in the shaping of new America.
      Furthermore,I will like to opine that the views and pressures of the antifederalists made the articles of confedration a 'toothless Bull dog' that was bound to fail from the start. The forms of representation and the choice of weak Presidency gave almost all the powers to the individual budding states.
       The present state constitution with all the amendments particularly the inclusion of the bills of rights,has come to term with the revolution principles.The constitution as it was known in pre-amendment form was not adequately committed to the fulfilment of the noble revolutionary principles.

===message:    Let me begin by saying that I agree with you in the aspect of these people being self centered, but I do not agree with you in the view of saying that they were impedeing development.  It is very easy to have hindsight bias with regards to the way that this country was put together.  It is another case however to actually have fought in the revolutionary war (which most of the antifederalist[backwoodsmen and frontiersmen] did)  They were just being weary of the form of a central government that would perhaps become like that of the country that they just fought against for their freedom.  Firthermore, antifederalists did not make the articles of confederation a "toothless bulldog"- The articles were doomed to fail from the start.

===message:Thomas Paine also said, "People were born with certain fundamental rights. The purpose of government was to protect those rights."  The Constitution failed to protect the rights of Blacks, Indians, and women.  The Constitution most definetely went against the principles of the Revolutionary war.  The cowardly framers of the Constitution had the opportunity to abolish slavery and did not.  Making them just as bad as the English government from which they were breaking from.

===message:We cannot too quickly brand the framers of the Constitution as evil or cowardly because they did not abolish slavery.  These people were products of their time and place, remember; they did not share the ideas that we take for granted today, that women and men are equal, that people of all races are equal, or even that children and adults are equal.  Slavery had been a part of the world in every hemisphere for thousands of years.  Women and children were second-class citizens almost everywhere, and had been since the dawn of time.  Let's not cloud the issue of an 18th century political revolution with ideals from 20th century social revolutions.  
<br><br>
What our country has done in the past hundred years has negated and reversed a few thousand years of social tradition -- never forget or belittle that.  Our society is a great and incredible thing, and the transformation that seems a slow one, occurring over a hundred years, is really, in the overall picture of global history, an extremely quick revolution.

===message:Nathaniel, you are right when you said they were products of their time, but that does not excuse them from blame.  Yes, the practice of slavery began thousands of years ago,and during that time the rulers enslaved others who were of their own race.  The framers of the Constitution were evil.  They did not enslave their fellow white men.  If slavery had been an institution that included every race that was in America at that time, then I would be more inclined to excuse them, but they delibrately did not enslave their white men, women, or children because they knew the institution of slavery was horrible.  So horrible, that they dared not inflict that kind of evil on their own.

By incorporating the ideas of today when discussing  history does not cloud the issues of what occurred, instead, it gives a better perspective on the way people thought.  And sheds light on their flaws, and why it is  better today for everyone, not just the elite or the majority.

===message:Yes, slavery based on racial lines is horrible -- by today's standards.  No, "during that time the rulers enslaved others who were of their own race" is not correct.  The thousands of years of slavery did not see Frenchmen enslaving Frenchmen, British enslaving British, and Turks enslaving Turks.  Muslim pirates raided the shores of southern Europeans and enslaved Europeans; it was against Muslim beliefs to enslave other Muslims.  That is why their slaves were Europeans and Africans.  It was against the practices of Christian Europeans, meanwhile, to enslave fellow Christians save for a very few exceptions; their slaves, therefore, were almost entirely either Muslim or African.  The Africa of the centuries in question was one of the few places where one found people enslaving others of their own race and religion.
<br><br>
Read up on your history, if you don't believe me, or go ask any of our professors of history.  The holy books of both Christianity and Islam have sections dealing with slavery as an accepted institution; it was not viewed as a sin, and the framers of our Constitution, who regarded all matters of society and religion from the 18th century point of view, cannot be so flippantly and ignorantly called "evil."

===message:The framers of the constitution were definitely a product of their environment. Everyone knew pretty much what they were taught. The main message was that men were superior to everyone else. In certain instances it took longer for some changes than others. It was because of these changes that were made we are able to enjoy the liberties and freedoms today. It took just one person to stand up and know and realize that everyone was created equal and no one person is more "superior" than the other.

===message:In reply to Mukaila. I agree with you that the “old order” was doomed for extinction. What I don’t agree with is that those who wanted to protect it were entirely self-centered and didn’t see things in the perspective of development. Take the Patriot Acts as an example. There are those people would like to be able to keep their privacy and not have the bill of rights turned upside down. But does that mean we can label them self-centered? It seems to me that it’s just a matter of people realizing that their freedoms are being infringed upon (I always like that word). Do you think that development depends on whether or not the government has total access to your life? Or can there be some other way of gaining the information that they need. That’s just another way of looking at it, something that actually applies to us today.

===message:I agree with Nathaniel,  Africans were the only people that enslaved their own people and sold them off for profit. However, regarding the time that they were revising the Constitution, they were wrong for not recognizing slaves as a WHOLE person, which shows that even back then politicans weren't good at math. So President Bush shouldn't feel bad that about his "Fuzzy Math" skills.
