===message:According to Tocqueville, the tariff was the blame for the Nullification crisis.  The Nullification maked it difficult for the Southerner to purchase the high price products from the Northern states.  The lower the price of the land by the western states caused the unity that help opposing the tariff.  The heathcare reform is a good example for the political discussion.  We as people of America need to unit together to fight for the righteouness.  Money does make the world go round, but we together can change that.
