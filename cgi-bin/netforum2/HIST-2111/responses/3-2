===message:I think that there is a lot of truth to this comment. I think that I admire and hate the same things about the Puritans. I admire their beliefs and the way they feel about each other and treat fellow Puritans but hate the way others are treated. I hate that they are not open to new ideas and beliefs. Puritan beliefs are admired and hated at the same time much like Americans these days. Today there are still people like act and believe like this.

===message:I agree with Patricia regarding the compassion shown by the Puritans toward the sick and the elderly within their community.  It is a shame, though, that they turned so dramatically from compassion to persecution as soon as witchcraft was suspected.  It seems that in only a moment, forgiveness, love, and penitence were thrown out the window in exchange for suspicion, fear, and persecution.

===message:Was it superstition that led them to the hangings or was it possibly a power struggle...Remember there were factions who wanted the pastor out and others who were supporters.  Remind you of anything in current events?...
A modern day witch hunt (politically) in California?  
Are people so different today?

===message:I agree with you. I do feel that alot of times thta it is hard for people to accept change and diversity.  We see this even today in our on country. Also, most of the time people don't like to accept responsibility for their own actions, therefore try to find some other reason for the cause.

===message:Patricia, that was a really good point that you made about them taken care of each other. They had a very strong sense of family and community, as long as it was their way. When others shy away from what they thought was right, they would become very defensive. The Puritans had the mentality of, "what we do is right" and they forgot about about everyone else in the process. I think the worst thing about them is that they fail to recognize that people are different. Because they were different they were punished.

===message:I agree with yo Patricia, I think that many regilious groups are the same as the Puritans it is just hard sometimes to find a middle ground between faithful/ dutiful and intolerant/overzealous.

===message:The puritans were united people that strongly believed in their believes.They would not allow any outside forces to interfere with their believes. I do not think there were witches in the colony, they were just a bunch of cowards and their fear increased as the word of witchcraft spread around.
