===message:Oh, you really hit this right on target. This is still alive today.  Greed causes man to place himself where destruction upon others , as well as sef destruction is inevitable. Money is definitely the root of all evil.  This is where most of all destruction stims from. Yes, we all need it to survive and be a blessing to others, but you have to have the right relationship with it. Don't let wealth overtake you, you overtake the wealth.
