===message:Helen, I do agree with you on the issue of taxing especially the poor people. It was very cruel of the British to impose taxes on cider which was the common man's drink while all the officials pocketted whatever taxes they collected plus their salaries. And besides if the British was spending so much money in efforts to collect taxes but losing money in trade, it should have been a good indication that taxing to finance war debt was a bad venture.
