===message:i agree with you totally that the tarriffs benefited just the people in the north. the people in the south did not gain any good benefit from the law. it seemed like the law was passed just to be in the favor of the people in the north.

===message: i agree that the tariffs only helped those people in the North. How it affected the people in the South because the things they needeed now had these high tariffs. The whole thing probably was created for the south to try and show their weaknesses.
