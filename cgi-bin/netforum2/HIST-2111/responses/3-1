===message:I am not sure if I can say I really admire the Puritans. The main fact that they were once persecuted due to a lack of understanding and acceptance of what they believed and then when they had the “power” they metered the same irrational behavior.  I am in no way condoning the practice of witchcraft or anything like it, but the means to convert should have been one that included pointing out the defects in the other’s belief system rather than forcibly having them deny being witches. This was stupid because if there any such practices, they only went more underground leaving the innocent to suffer the consequences. 


I believe there may have been a few witches in Massachusetts Bay but they were never caught, the few that confessed were either initiates or sacred. 


The mass hysteria could also be attributed to, that if there was a counter religion thriving among the Puritans it could be a challenge to those in authority who claimed to be devout Christians.

===message:Ian, you cannot hate the puritians like that. These people were born into a society with no religion so they had to come up with their own believe till they realized that what they are believing on, is evil. Just take a moment an think about it, these people knew what they where doing except that they thought they had a good believe on witchcraft. So do not blame them for their believes. It was just a practise.
