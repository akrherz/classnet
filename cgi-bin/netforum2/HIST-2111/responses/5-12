I can whole heartedly understand exactly where you are coming from when you say that the poor were making the decisions that it was worng to tax stamps. It is not wrong for the people to have these thoughts, but my issue is why couldnt they not come up with them on their own? Why did they have to have the elite in their ear, saying this, that, and the other? I still agree with myself in that if you dont have anything to be taxed why even be bothered? But I can also your point of view its the principal.
