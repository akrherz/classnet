You had asked if people (parliament) who don't have to pay taxes should be allowed to pass laws concerning taxes. Well I agree they shouldn't as well. But I find it ironic that those who pass taxes in this country now are the ones who don't really pay them. Or at least the tax laws are catered to those who those who make them. How many people can write off for having a pond in their back yard? Basically we have taxation with representation now. But those representatives still aren't paying taxes. I just found your question ironic considering today’s circumstances are not all that different from the past.
