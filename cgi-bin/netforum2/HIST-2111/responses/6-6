===message:yeah i agree with lydia. most of us are scared of changes. when we hear of changes especially about something that will not benefit us we get scared and oppose those changes. that is why the state righters were afraid of the outcome that would follow if the states were ruled by the federal.

===message:I still think the State-righters were looking at things from the point of view that originally it was all a business venture and they wanted it to remain as such. They only succombed to a central government because they needed it to protect their interests but deep down they were still thinking about the profit margin

===message:The constitution failed in one regard.  It failed to end slavery.  How can a nation that was founded on principles such as freedom and equality enslave people.  Even after 1808 the government did little to force the abolishment of slavery.  The constitution and its framers failed miserably.

===message:I agree that it did fail in the aspect that it did not stop slavery but I wouldn't say that it failed miserably.  The Constitution made a step toward fixing all the problems.  I believe that if the people who made the Constitution weren't so worried about getting votes and getting the Constitution ratified then they may have made the provisions to end slavery.
