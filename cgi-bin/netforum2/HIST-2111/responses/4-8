===message:Azure,

I also agree with you how could something that is supposed to bring you happiness and joy have so many consequences. You would think it be just the opposite. I think that just because the religions are different does not necessarily mean they are "different" everyone has sins but they just deal with them in many different ways. Maybe one person just took from experience with the great awakening and added what they thought was missing or vice-versa. But it is sad that so many other religions were formed.

===message:Ronda I completely agree with you on the fact that there are many "different" religions but they all have sinned in some way but they have a different way of dealing with it. That goes to show from the seventeeth century to the twenith century not much has changed.

===message:i agree with you. if you have a sense of joy and happiness in something there is no way it should have so many consequences. the messages from whitefield and others were touching and encouraging. it was at the same time challenging. you really did hit on the question well.
