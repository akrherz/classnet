===message:I agree I feel like if the Europeans stayed in their own habitat the Indians would have been a more prevalent culture during that time. While Columbus and Cortes and everyone was exploring new places they were killing off all the Native Americans, and the sad part was they were doing it intentionally.

===message:i agree with most of my mates. The Europeans did not bring any happiness to the Native Americans. They wanted things their way and also wanted to take over what the native americans had. All they did was to bring illness to the native americans which declined their population.

===message:I believe that it was only a matter of time before the Americas would be discovered. This large piece of land could not continue to be overlooked.I believe that if someone else would have discovered the land the transition would have been much smoother.I do not believe there would have been such  brutal treatment and disease in the land.If I could speak to Cortes there would just be alot of questions starting with, how was this allowed to happen? how could you be so selfish? I feel that we as American people still force ourselves and our beliefs on others. Since many of the American people don't know our history it is constantly repeating it's self.
