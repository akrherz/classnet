===message:Indeed, "taxation without representation" is what I would have said to sum up the philosophies of the American colonists.  Nobody likes to be pushed around, and even if the pushing is slight or even vaguely legal, nobody likes to even feel pushed around.

===message:Hey Nathaniel. I areally agree with you about the taxation without representation because if the British people had allowed those people to be represented, the taxes may not have imposed but it was too much for the people that's why they decided to stand for their right. I believe and agree with you that nobody wants to be pushed around.
