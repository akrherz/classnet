===message:Nathaniel, I do agree with everything that you spoke on. That it is good that the people realized they needed one central government. Its like that saying you have five separate fingers, but when you ball it up into a fist it can strike a mighty blow. That same principle can be put to the comparison with the government. Instead of there being many different countries with different rules and regulations there is one, that is stronger than anyone person can imagine.
