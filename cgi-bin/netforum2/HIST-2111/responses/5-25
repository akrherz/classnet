===message:Taxation without representation. Why should one have to pay for anything if they are not being represnted? The items that was being taxed was items enjoyed by all, no matter what your social class. This money that was to be taken away could have helped some of them out, so that they could have some of the finer things in life. Thank goodness for Patrick Henry, he stood up for what he believed and knew that the people would stand up with him.
