===message:Hi Lydia. I strongly agree with you that those who opposed the ratification of the constitution are not the state righters but i believe that they are the anti-federalists. And for the fact that the articles tried to protect the states in order to stop the central government from imposing powers over the states and the aspects of the checks and balances which was to bring out the right of the equality among the people. You made good points that i agreed with.
