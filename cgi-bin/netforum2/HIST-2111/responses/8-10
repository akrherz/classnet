===message:I agree.  The women had an advantage over the other two.  Once the men realized that their plight was serious and not something to pass time, they began to treat the matter more seriously.

===message:I disagree with Erica. To me, Women, blacks and Indians were basicly precived on the same level.  They all had to struggle to try to gain their equailty.  I really dont see where women had advantage over the other two races.  All three could not vote, own property, or voice their opinion in public.
