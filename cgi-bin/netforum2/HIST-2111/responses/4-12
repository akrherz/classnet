===message:Adrienne, i agree with when you said that the great awakening brought unity to the people. The Great Awakening really united the people with religion. Whitefield and other Evangelist preaching, encouraged many sinners to seek God actively, pray and read the bible. it was really a blessing to the people especially the puritians.
