===message:I completely agree with Shakria about the Native American women being degreaded and rape.  I feel if the Spainards whould have been in Native Americans situation things would have been completely different.  How can you make someone read and sign an agreement that if they didn't convert to their religion that their women would be tortured.

===message:I think it is very naive to think he would have listened.  First of all, remember the difference in the cultures.  Cortes was looking for gold and riches and considered the natives he found to be less than worthy of consideration.  In other words, they were inferior to his own people.  Although the natives were "civilized", he didn't recognize with the clarity that we have looking back that their culture was worthy of leaving intact.  He was determined to fulfill his duty to his original goals.

===message:I have to agree with Amy, the cultures were very different. As she said most likely the Spanish considered the Native Americas as sub-human, therefore anything that was done to them was AOK. Also I think the men who went and did all those things to the women were of a different mindset, some people just don't think about the consequences of what they do or how they might affect other people and quite frankly women weren't viewed in too good of a light at that time anyway <in Europe>, but that doesn't excuse what they did. If I had a chance to talk to Cortez I honestly wouldn't even waste my time talking to a person such as him. I mean if he can do the things he did would the words of a rational person have any kind of effect on him instead of the pleading of his victims? And dang I could never understand why those who conquer have such a desire to destroy anything and everything that wasn't built by their hands or written using their words. I think that's a trait of all who go out to conquer. It seems only the people who clean up the mess have the time or the inclination to think about everything that has been lost as a consequence.
