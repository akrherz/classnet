===message:Hey Amy. I think i agree with you that the great awakening was a successful one because of the way the two evangelists Whitefield and Edwards preached to people. Though it took longer before people repented but those evangelists did a great job by converting a lot of people into christianity and I also agree with you that the great Awakening less the rituals. That was a good point

===message:Helen,
Thanks for the reply.  I was wondering if you (or any other class member) think the lack of rituals in the "new" churches of the great awakening and the lessening of rules (like for conversion) contributed any to the coming Revolution? For example, did the freedom and lack of a need to be "ruled" by church leaders help the colonists have the self confidence to break away from the British rule?
