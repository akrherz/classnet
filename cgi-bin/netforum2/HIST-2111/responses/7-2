===message:Jerome, I completely agree with you. I seemed that Toqueville did blame the Nullification crisis on South Carolina thinking that Congress turned a deaf ear to its remonstrances. It seemed that changes in the economy also contributed to the crisis, with the north being more diversified and the south maintaining a mostly agriculural economy. As far as today, the economy always shapes politics, as far as the job market, taxes, etc.

===message:Wow Jerome I cant really add anything to that because you answered every question, and I dont want to regurgitate everything you just said. I do want to speak on job stability, is shaped by our economic development. What I dont understand is, I know that 911 shook the whole country and due to that and many other circumstances a lot of people either lost their jobs or are out of work now. I think that maybe if all the rich people put their funds to work it would create jobs for everyone. The rich people have millions and millions of dollars, some even have billions, I know that they could use some of that money and give a qualified person a job, I know P. Diddy can use a car washer for all of those cars he has.

===message:Hey Jerome. I agree with your points that changes in the market economy contributed to the nullification crisis because the tariff was not giving the southern states any benefit because they based on agriculture and the tariff was too much for them to afford. And they are not more diversified like the northern states.

===message:Ronda, I agree with you and disagree with your points on the rich.  The point that I agree with you on is that the  rich do have a means to where than can create jobs.  However, where I disagree with you is, that they should make a point of doing it.  Don't get me wrong, but, if you believe in the fundamental truths of the framers of the constitution then you have to agree that each and everyone of us has an right to the pursuit of happiness and that each person has the right to do what they want as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others.  With that said, we as a society should not wait for the handouts of the rich or the government to create jobs for us.  You and I today can create jobs on our on.  In todays society we have more advantages with the electronic age, education, finances, etc. to start any business whether its a small company out of your home or you and five other friends.  For example, we can high five high school kids to do lawn work for $5/hr.  You've just put people to work.  I think if society went back to the fundamental thought of being responsible for ones own actions we would get back to what the original framers meant for this country to be a true Democratic-Republic, not a Socialistic society.  Then you wouldn't have all the problems that we face today.

===message:I agree with Rhonda somewhat. I believe the rich do have enough money to help others if they wanted to. Where I don't agree is that they don't have to and shouldn't. They worked hard enough for their money enough that it is their own. There are some good ones out there that help out and give money to different causes only because they want to but not have to. We are all responsible for ourselves and noone else. We all have the means to go out and make our own money. We can create our own jobs and get any education we need to do that. There is always something out there for all of us if we really want to find it. We cannot blame the government or the rich for not helping us out there.
