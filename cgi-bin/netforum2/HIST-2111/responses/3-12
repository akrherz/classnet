===message:You have a point about if things are done different by the women then they were considered witches. But also you have to look at the time frame that all of this was going on. These people did not adapt to change easily at all. It could have been the right way or someone could be showing "the light" but because it was different it should be looked upon as evil. Today we are most definitely a lot more accepting of the things that we see. Especially in Atlanta, there is no telling WHAT you might see walking down the street!

===message:I completely agree that if followed the same belief we as a county would be better off.  Also that when women expressed their point of view and tried to make some difference the Bay they were considered Witches was clearly mistaken.  The government was afraid that more women who try to make a difference leaving their "job" behind.  So the government step in and ship them off the colony to try to scare the other bold women not to express their opionions.

===message:I would agree with the way they took care of their community is to be admired.  The Bible was their instructional tool to follow and they certainly lived their lives according to their interpretations of it. Their interpretation of the Bible is where the maheim comes into play.  Anything that was done and considered not of the Bible had to be of witch craft according to their beliefs. No, I don't believe witches existed in Massachusetts Bay.  I could have been considered a witch had I not wanted to go the their church services, and wanted to wear something other than the fashion that was availabe at the time.  Anything could have provoked these people to form a mob outside your door.

===message:I also agree that one of the best things about the Puritans was that they tried to live their lives based on their interpretation of the Bible. This was also their worst characteristic because they allowed anything that was outside of their interpretation to completely throw them off. The fact that they were able to have such a mass hysteria over supposed witches I feel shows that some of them were not secure enough in their faith. That they spared those who admitted to having been witches and killed those who professed their innocence is a little backwards in my opinion.
The strong family unit was also something I admire, it did seem to keep a certain balance within the community and of course the fact that they were expected to help out those that were not as well off as themselves. The only fault with that was that they only helped out each other and no one outside of their faith. 
I seriously doubt there were any witches in that community, I have no idea what so ever as to why that situation got as far as it did. Some people say it was stress over their current situation or wanting to blame their problems on something, in this case the witches. It was just confusing how something so baseless could have had so much power over supposedly such faith bound people.
