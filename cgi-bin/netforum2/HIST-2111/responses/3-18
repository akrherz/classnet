===message:I agree that the Puritans treated women unfairly.  As far as their standards of perfection, I think that they had to maintain a strict standard of living in order for their society and community to survive.  That's how they made it so far - they were very structured.  But you're right, you can't expect people to tolerate such expectations for long.
