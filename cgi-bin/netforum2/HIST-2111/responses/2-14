You must realize, I hope, that Cortez had no conception of democracy.  He was a product of his time and place, which happened to be 16th century Europe.  Europe at this time was dominated by monarchs, powerful nobles, and the upper clergymen.  Government by the concent of the governed (in a pure form; Britain was a semi-exception, with the Magna Carta and their beheading of their Monarch and short-lived Commonwealth under Parliament) on any significant scale had been unheard of in Europe for over a thousand years, and would not emerge in any western civilization until the foundation of the United States and the soon-to-follow French Revolution.<br><br>
I truly hope that "all he needed to do is ask Tenochtitlan for the power and the wealth" is not intended to reply that the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan would respond to such a request with glad assent.
