===message:I couldn’t call those who opposed ratifying the constitution state righters. I would say they fall under the category of anti-federalists. The Articles protected the power of the states under the Constitution by denying Congress and its diplomats the authority to regulate interstate or foreign commerce.  I don’t think state government should have more power than the federal government because federal government is what keeps us unified. Not having the federal government there would probably be chaos in America. I think the Constitution fulfilled revolutionary principles.
