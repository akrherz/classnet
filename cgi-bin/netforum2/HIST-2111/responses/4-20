===message:Tiffany, i understand what you are saying, but don't you think the Evanglists played important role in the Great Awakening? I felt i should point this out because you did not discuss anything about them. Actually, these Evangelist preachings, really help people to understand the word of God and how to worship their God in spirit and in truth. It also strengthen many people's faith in God.
