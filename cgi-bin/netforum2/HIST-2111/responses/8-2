===message:Jerome, I also think another reason women were supressed was because men (black & white)thought women were too "emotional" to think as well as a man.

I dont too much think its because woman are emotional. In most cases females think better than two men combined. The men just wanted to control everything. Its more of a sense that, especially in 2003, as women, we are not depending on no man to do anything for us we are doing for ourselves. My philosophy is anything he can do I can just as good if not better.

===message:Hi Jerome, i agree strongly with you that the white feared the blacks would be better than them. The white were insecure of themselves. they thought the blacks would be far more advanced and take over. they wanted to live a different life from the blacks. It all because of their insecurity. Looking at things now blacks are somewhat on the same level with the white.

===message:Hi Jerome. I can understand what you said about the Americans being scared of giving the blacks the same equal right. It was because they thought the blacks would overpower them and that the blacks would become more intelligent and wealthier than them. They also felt it was not right to allow the women to speak in public because they felt women were only meant to take care of household chores, go to farm and take care of children.

===message:Ronda, I agree with you except for the women are smarter than two men statement.  Blacks, Indians and Women historically have gotten a raw deal from a society that view(ed)s them as second class citizens.  Its sad that people today still don't realize that if we as a society can get beyond all the petty things such as race and realize that we are one society that was founded on freedom and equality.  That a person can do what they please as long as it does not restrict the freedom of the next person.  These basic principles are what Thomas Paine was writting about in Common Sense (http://www.bartleby.com/133/) over 300 years ago and we still don't get it. Why?

===message:You both have good points except...When you refer to "whites",its incorrect.  Half the population of whites (females) were not a part of the decision making process.  I do agree relationships are better, but there is still a long ways to go.  I can only speak though my experiences as a white woman.  Where I am employed, the "Good Ole Boy System" as far as opportunies such as advancement, salary, etc. is still alive and kicking although the degree (I've been here ten years) gets less & less with time.

===message:I do agree that the white Americans feared giving the blacks total freedom because they would take over their rights and thus limit their opportunities. They did not want to face the challenge of competing with the blacks and wanted to keep them under oppression as long as they would and that way the blacks would not reach out for their potentials.
