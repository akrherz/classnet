I agree with you on the great awakening. I am not sure if what was going on made them happy, i feel like they realized if they were sinning then it was time to straighten up and fly right. So once they have admitted their sins it was a burdejn lifted off their shoulders so that maybe they could be happy. I think that the way sermons used to be presented is very relevant because a lot of preachers say exactly what they need to say to capture the audience as well as speak the truth.

Why else would thousands of people flock to hear a man speak if he was not giving messages that makes you feel good. You can take the excert that Franklin wrote he had every intention not contribute to the offering but by the end of the sermon he emptied his pockets of all his money. This Whitfield guy was Good!For awhile in some parts the towns were more peaceful and less sinful. Happy peple makes for a happy life, which they all seemed to have thanks to the great awakening.
