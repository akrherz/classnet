===message:I AGREE WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE EUROPEANS WERE GREEDY THEY DID WHATEVER THEY COULD TO GET GOLD. IT WAS NOT ONLY GOLD THEY WANTED, BECAUSE OF THEIR "STATUS" THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD HAVE ANYTHING THAT THEY WANTED. I FOUND IT FUNNY WHEN THE CARIBS KILLED THEM OFF. I FELT LIKE THEY MOST DEFINITELY EXPLOITED THE WOMEN ESPECIALLY THE CARIBS, I GUESS THAT PROSTITUTION TRULY IS THE OLDEST PROFESSION.

Second, I think there are many similarities in the way the United States goes about its foreign policy.  Very often we "go in" to a situation because we think we know better and are better.  The world is certainly getting smaller and I don't always agree with the mentality that since we are the superpower, we are the ones who have to go in and "fix" things.  I would rather spend the billions of dollars we spend (did you know it is costing 40 billion a month to continue in Iraq) and use it on humanitarian aid.  Wouldn't we all be better off if the whole world was economically more sound?

===message:I did find it funny but not funny haha. Im not saying that two wrongs make a right but I am saying that these people came in on the Caribs turf, and just started claiming stuff including women, and you know there were raping them, so to answer your question I did did it funny, they deserved to die, no one should be violated regardless of who they are.

===message:I agree with you Amy.  I think that America has always felt like a "superpower".  I think that the way of thinking that the Americans have is that we are better off than others and we have to show them how things can be and if they don't agree with us, we force it on them (just like the Europeans did to the Indians).  I think that is horrible and that the leaders of the US should let people have their own beliefs.  I feel as though they should be there for other countries but they shouldn't "bully" them.

===message:This is supposed to be the land of the free but I often time question that. Because the American people constanly force things on other people. It has gotten so bad that the American people are imposing things on other American people, and the sad thing is this seems to be the American way.

===message:I agree with the comment that two wrongs don't make a right. I know it was not right what the Europeans did and it was not right for them to kill people off but it is not right for people to kill them off either. If we don't agree with one we cannot agree with the other no matter what was deserved.

===message:Indeed, rape is horrific intolerable, and inexcusable.  The slaughter of stone age civilizations by soldiers of a significantly advanced society is also horrific.  The previously unknown STD brought back to Europe by these fellows strikes me as a punishment that fits the crime.  In that day and age, remember, lacking antibiotics, syphillis resulted in blindness (and madness too, I think) and death.
