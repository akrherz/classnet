===message:I can't say I agree with Asuquo when she expresses gladness concerning executions; loss of life is tragic, especially when unnecessary and fueled by ignorance disguised as either learning or religious zeal.

===message:I do not agree with you. there were no witches in Massachusettes bay. the fact that they had their own beliefs didn't make them witches. there is a reason behind their beliefs and i think you should not be glad that those who didn't belief got executed.

===message:I do not think there were witches in the Massachusets bay among the Puritans. I think They were just overcome by the spirit fear and being paranoid. I think that Tituba, the Pariss's slave girl, just confessed on what she belived.There was no right for the people to be persecuted for expressing their believes.

===message:Are you serious?  You are glad they were executed?  Did you really think they were guilty of a crime punishable by death?  I am personally not in favor of the death penalty for anyone.  Have you ever heard of Sacco and Venzetti?  (spelling?)  They were accused, found guilty and executed and later proven innocent.  What a crime that was.  The same is true for these women.  Hysteria created an atmosphere that led to their demise, not real proof of any crime.

===message:Hey Nathali. Yes, I agree with what you said but it is like you are misunderstanding me in the sense that you said that i am glad about the execution of the innocent souls. With that, I am emphatically saying "NO" to that because that was not what i meant. You can see where it is written in the text about the witches so i am saying this according what i read in my text and i am not happy about the execution because it is inhuman to kill you fellow human being and i cannot be that heartless to hear such thing and be happy about because nobody knows tommorrow. It could happen to you or me or any of our sibblings or relations. it is very wrong to kill.

===message:Hey Candy. I do not think that you really understand what i said. I want to correct what about what you said that it is wrong for me to be glad that those people were executed. I am a human being and there is no way i would be happy to see any of my sibblings or my relations killed not to talk of other people. do you know how expensive human beings are? so it is not right for prople to kill their fellow human beings. All i am saying is that being that someone confessed that she was a witch that means the person is a witch. The person may confess in other for her not to be killed or out of fear or whatever, people would believe her because she confessed with her own mouth.

===message:Hey Lydia. I think you may be right on your own side but to me, being that the woman confessed with her own mouth, people will believe that she is one and she may not be one but may confess out of fear or the way the execution was going on then.
