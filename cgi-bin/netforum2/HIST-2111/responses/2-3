===message:I totally agree with you.  I believe that the Europeans started racism by the way they just assumed that they were better than the Indians.  I wonder what makes people feel that they are better than others especially in this situation because the Indians had their own language, they were hunting and taking care of their families.  However, if the Europeans wouldn't have come over to "The New World" then I believe that someone else would have and the same thing would have happened but with another country involved.  I guess it was inevitable for those horrible things to happen to the Indians.

===message:I agree with this post only I am not sure that Cortes would even listen.  I might have appealed to his sense of Christianity, as my sense of it says not to do the things he did.  It is unfortunate what people like Columbus and Cortes do under the pretense of Christianity.  Of course, Columbus was certainly open about his desire for gold and more discoveries.  He even included in his "setup" of the new land/towns to include provisions for continued support of those who wanted to explore more.  
If the Europeans had not invaded and taken over the New World, I am certain that the Native Americans would have eventually caught up to Europe in some ways, yet think how many hundreds of years Europe had been developing...When I look at Third World countries today I wonder how there can still be people who have no indoor plumbing, etc.  So maybe the Native Americans would have continued to thrive but in a different, parallel way to the rest of today's Third World countries.

===message:Have you noticed that anyone that wasnt European was treated dirty? If the Europeans did not invade the land I dont know if another group of people would have acted the same way. The Europeans were just ruthless.

===message:     I think the problem is alot older than even the period of history that we are reading about.  Romans killed Celts and Germanic tribes in Europe before Europe WAS Europe. This kind of conquest has been around since the beginning of time, and I do not think that it has stopped.  I am a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and I think this study parallels what is going on in our country at this very moment.  All I am going to say is that we crossed the border into Iraq 9 hours earlier than planned because they started burning their oil wells.  Not because there was a threat, but because they were destroying a natural resource that we wanted, so we took it, sort of like conquistadors who found some shiny gold. I'm not on the side of terrorism or anything, and alot of what we did over there was for the good, I just beleive there is a major flaw in human nature when it comes to viewing people as a nation of barbarians or terrorists.  Goodnight

===message:I agree with you. The U.S. is definitely continuing its pattern. So much is going on today, mostly centered around the greed for money and power. Self destruction is on its way if we don't wake up and see the true value of this life.

===message:I agree with you. We speak of the Europeans the way that we do because they are the ones who actually discovered America. If it had been another group would it have been the same? For all we know it might have been much worse. Some things might have changed but some things were inevitable.

===message:Ryan was correct when he stated that the problem of racism predates the enslavement of African-Americans before the Civil War, predateing also the Spanish conquering the Caribbean.  "Othello" gives a hint of such feelings long before the United States existed.  For those who consider the Torah/Bible to be a valid historical source, the enslavement of the Hebrews by the Egyptians would predate even the Romans' view of other cultures as inferior.  China serves as another example; the Chinese referred to their land as "The Middle Kingdom" - inferring that other cultures were outside on the fringe, living in a far less civilized state of existence.

===message:Rhonda, not only were there ruthless, but they were also a greedy set of human beings who have no remorse over anything. I would also consider them as those who and not intelligent because if they were, they would have come up with their own civilization without invading others.
