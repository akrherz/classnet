===message:Jaime, I would ask Cortes the same question.  The Aztecs revered him as a "god", and would have given him anything he requested.  He had an advantage over them, in that they were afraid of him because of the incident that took place on the ship.  He was a very ungrateful man.  He didn't show the common courtesy of appreciation when the messengers of Monctezuma presented him with Aztec treasure and adorned clothing.  Cortes' treatment of the Aztecs shows the arrogance the Spaniards had when conquering these territories.  Divide and Conquer also was a factor in the demise to the Aztecs.  Cortes was able to form allies with neighboring enemies of Monctezuma.  It is very unfortunate that both Native Indians and the Aztecs were not aligned with each other to combat the Spaniards.  Hind sight is 20/20, and today we can assume that had the natives worked and fought together, the Spaniards would not have conquered as much territory as they allowed to.

===message:I think pretty much everyone agrees that if the Europeans never discovered America history would have definitely been different, but I don't agree that slavery would not have taken place, only because they were slaves during the Roman Empire, and they had no boundaries it did not matter what color you were, purple, black, blue, or yellow. I also agree with Jaime, the US is exactly like the Europeans because we take what we want from whoever has the goods by any means necessary.

===message:I like Jaime's idea of diseases. I think it is a good theory that disease might not have been as big of a threat. I believe the Native Americans could have also invented more cures.

===message:I too think that history would have turned out much differently if Europeans had not discovered the Americas. But if a cow would have fell over on Monday instead of a Tuesday history would have been different as well. Meaning any change no matter how big would have changed what we considered history. Slavery as the 'post plague' Europeans instituted it could have come to be through another group of people. Slavery has existed for quite a while. And I think that the Native Americans could have found cures to everything :) they seemed to have had a knowledge of the earth and how to use it in the best possible way
