===message:The Puritans was not ashamed of their God nor their religion. It wasn't a closet religion. They were also against ant type of disorder or conflict, this is the tool of the devil. As for the witches,there was those that practiced magic. If one didn't understand or was confused about the natural, unexplainable things that would happen the people would contribute it to witches. It was also a way to get a hold of extra land by saying that someone was a witch, it was a way of keeping one from accusing you.
