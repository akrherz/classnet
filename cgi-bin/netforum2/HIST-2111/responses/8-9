===message:I think that everyone has very good points on this discussion question.  I do feel however that one fear of the abolition of slavery that consumed north and south alike was that of integration and the "mixing of races." 
Though today blacks enjoy a "legal institutionalized" freedom, people somewhat forget that is have only been aproximatey 40 years since legal integration was pushed on the south. Many people in the south as well as the north feared integration on the implication that it would allow for interacial marriage and mulatto children (which was a great taboo).  As one of President Lincoln detractors put it "the mongrelization of the races."  In fact in the 18th century all southern states and many northern ones inacted laws prohibiting interacial marriages.  Though biracial children were not unknown of, especially on plantations were masters had been known to have sex with slave women, it was the virtue of white women that many white men sought to protect.  The 1915 film Birth of a Nation echoes some of these veiws of defending the pure white damsel, from the horrid lustful black man.  Not until the 1967 Supreme Court ruling in the Loving v. Virginia case did the federal goverment rule that not recognizing  interacial marriage was unconstitutional.  Still laws do little to change the minds of society and mixed marriages were still considered taboo by many and still today statstics show only 45 percent of people think it okay to marry across cultural lines.  For those of us who do dare to venture however we enjoy a freedom that those before us did not. I believe this is because all in all many people still only feel comfortable around "there own kind." I agree with Helen when she says it is time to think out of the box when it comes to race relations.

===message:Good point Marcella, but I think also it was more so the fact of their fear of loosing income and power. As you stated bi-racial children already existed, mostly through rape. However, they, the men knew they could always control them due to them being slaves but if they were free them they would have laws (when enforced and honored) to protect them. Besides   many of the land owners had no clue how to really work a plantation and could you imagine if the southern blacks started to form their own financial societies like they did in the North? White farmers and owners would be out of business within a few years. <P>
their greatest opposition was due to fear of loosing power.

===message:You've made good points. Women in a sense were never the controllers of their lives if they married.  This would have to have been like invisible shackles placed on them.  Leaving home from one man's control only to enter into anothers was bound to ignite a movement among women.  You are correct in your analysis in the North and South opposing the rights of blacks.  I'm sure their had to be a fear of retaliation for the mistreatment of blacks and indians.  In order to keep them from retaliating they could never allow them to rights that they were afforded.  Also, as you mentioned, they did not want their way of life disrupted.  They enjoyed their way of life at others misery.

===message:I agree with Marcella regarding "white women were more emphathic to the instituion of slavery do to their own restrictions and citizenship status." However, I believe that white women were more accepted into society then a black woman. 

Most bi-racial children during slavery were from the Slave masters forcing themselves on the women slaves.  
 
During slavery most bi-racial children existed due to the slave masters rapping their black slaves. Bi-racial children today are not a result of rapes.
