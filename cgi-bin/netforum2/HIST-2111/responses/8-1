You brought out some good points there are many struggles with the the population of women and African American, but that same struggle that bombarded this country many years is ago is very much so still present today. It is the mind set of of all our ancestors past, present, and future that allow us to behave in such a manner. That is how so many stereotypes are formed, just because you are a certain race you have to some how fit into that loop, but what people fail to realize is that what everyone does, does not fit into that square box, we have to learn to think out of the box.
