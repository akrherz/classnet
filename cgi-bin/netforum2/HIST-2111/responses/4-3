I think you have made a excellent observation with your comparison of the Great Awakening and the mood of our nation during the Scopes Trial.

To give my opinion as to whether I feel that things have changed in our thinking as a society since the Scopes Trial the answer is yes.  I feel that people have become more open in expecting science and evolution into their religious beliefs.  I do not think that as society we would have the some values (or arguable lack of values) that we do had we have not expected some aspects of science into our religious beliefs.  Though I do still know people (who are very religious) that have a hard time with expecting things such as the theory of evolution,  as a whole however I think people have been able to integrate the two.
I do not know how this effects those who are not Christians. I wouldn't want to speculate on this issue however I do know it  must be had for those with strong religious ties in a country and in an age where religion takes a back seat to science, pop culture, and the polically correct.  Be it right or wrong things such as the battle over the Ten Commandment monument shows that there will always be a struggle between people who are tring to keep traditional religious values and those who are tring to institute change.

===message:In relation but not relavent to the issue I am not from the "Bible Belt" though I have resided here for six years now. I must say it was a change for me to see the amount of fellowship, and importance that church plays in the lives of so many people in all cultures and communities in Georgia.  Not to give the impression that northerns do not go to chruch or that fellowship is not important to the region, but it is not as vigorious as it is in the south.  It reminds me of a quote from a movie that I found particularly humorous 
"You know you're in the bible belt when there are more churches than Starbucks."
I think living here has made me more aware of the importance of religion (for me Christianity) in my life.  However I feel that coming from the north I am more tolerant of people from different faiths, and possible more politically correct then had I not come from the north. 
(This is not a criticism of the south for those from here it is just a personal observation)
It is truly great to experience both sides.

===message:I agree with the two previous writers in that the great awakening is similar to the monkey trial.  However, there are some great differences also.  The most significant is that the sweeping changes brought by the great awakening were a matter of church institution vs. faith(and practices of) whereas the Scopes trial was about church beliefs vs. science and non-believers.  In the Whitefield days, the arguments were between all believers who just chose different ways to practice their faiths.  This is more like the issues of today where we need to consider many different believers (islam, judaism, christianity, buddhism, etc) and be open to their freedom to practice their own faith.  To broaden this, we can even include atheists and agnostics as they too have the right to "believe" what they choose and it is our country's great freedoms that allow us all to try to live in harmony despite vast differences in those beliefs.  I think the great awakening is more like this than the scopes trial issues.

===message:I believe that these different religions such as Hindus, Buddhists and Atheists have made the world more complicated but it has also made us a more accepting society.  It gives people the right to choose what they want to believe in rather than making someone believe one certain way.  I am not saying that everyone likes the ideas of these certain religions and that people don't say bad remarks about them.  I just believe that, we as a society, have become more accepting.  I do have one question...In all this mix of religions and beliefs, do you feel that we have strayed from the real meaning of God and his work to make it what we want it to be?
