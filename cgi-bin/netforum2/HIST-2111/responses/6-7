===message:Hey Mukaila Ajayi. I also agree with you that those who oppossed the ratification of the constitution are not the state righters because those who opposed the ratification of the constitution could be the anti-federalist due to the fact that the federal government were not allowed to impose those laws on the states and moreso, were asked to give the states their equality. The states should be given their own equality in order for them to take care of their states but not to overpower the federal government because there are certain problems the federal government can solve that the states cannot solve.
