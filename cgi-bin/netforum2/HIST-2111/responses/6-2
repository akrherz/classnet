===message:I do not agree with Jill too that the group that opposed the constitution were fighting for the state.Certainly, they had their hidden agenda,and part of it was the fact that they could not stand the inevitable diversified and large American society.They could not imagine anything better than the bitter experience they had under the british's collonial power.It was more of individual interest rather than for state.
         I do not share your view on the constitution too,I think the constitution failed to address the principles of the revolution by it's deliberate silence on the issue of slavery.The doctrine of equality of men championed by the revolution can never be reconciled with the institution of slavery that was not addressed by the constitution.

===message:I have to disagree with Mukaila. I think one of the main issues of the revolution was taxation without representation.  Thomas Jefferson certainly wanted equality for all people and did have it in the original constitution he wrote, but the southern states would never have signed on.. Although it was not right, it was a necessary evil to get all 13 colonies to unify.

===message:I disagree with Mukaila Ajayi.  I think one of the main reasons for the revolution was taxation without representation. Thomas Jefferson did want equality for all people and wrote it into his draft of the Constitution, but it was taken out because it was important to unify all 13 colonies and the southern colonies would have walked away. For all to be unified at that time, it was a necessary compromise.

===message:I agree with Patrici, on the fact that Jefferson did want equality for all people. However, he had to take that part out in order to include all the southern states. If he had not have done that, then the southern states probably would have never approved of the Constitution.

===message:I disagree, first, I do not feel that those that ratified the constitution were "state righters".  They merely got together to form a central government that would protect their own interests. How could they care about state rights when it states on pg 215, "They were willing to enter into whatever compromises seemed necessary in order to gain the consent of their fellow delegates.".  Also, the Articles under the constitution guarenteed states a republican form of government.  However, had they incorporated what the Articles of Confideration (each state retains full sovereignty) then the states would have truly retained power.  Which the states should, the original intent of the federal government was to protect the soverign United States from a foreign invader.  The states should have retained their own power.  Lastly, how could the constitution have fulfilled the revolutionary principles?  They fought under the principle of human equality and that all people were born with certain fundamental rights that all people were the same and all had the same rights.  Well, if this was why they were fighting then why did they not abolish slavery in the Constitution? The framers of the Constitiution were clearly only out to protect their own interests and in my opinion hypocrites.

===message:How can the enslavement of people be a necessary compromise?  They should have continued to debate until all enslaved men/women were free and equal as they so called were trying to accomplish for themselves through the Revolution.  Thomas Paine sold a 100,000 copies of Common Sense.  That's a best seller back in those days.  You mean to say that not one of these men had the nerve to say that enslavement of a people is wrong, let's continue to debate?

===message:I do not think that those who opposed the ratification of the constitution were state righters. I think they were scared by the change of power from the state rights to being governed by the federal government. Having gone through the british brutal government once they did not want to go through one more time.

===message:"State Righters", they wanted each state to have their own laws that governed the residents of each individual state.  The notion of a federal government overriding state laws did not appease them because it would seem logical for them to not want a government to overrule any law that they had put in place for their own protection and benefit. 

 I will say that I agree with a fellow classmate on the subject of the constitution not being complete by totally ignoring the institution of slavery.  I believe it was ignored because those who constructed the constitution knew the practice of slavery was evil.  They were these "so called" christian people with the utmost morale principles,and here they were basking in the luxury and the prominent appearance of owning slaves brought to their lives.  So to completely omit it from the constitution was to ignore the fact that it was wrong, and was viewed as something that was just a part of life and did not need any governing laws.  We can not forget that the constitution was not made with the rights of slaves in mind.  So when the beginning line of the constition: "We the people", "We did not mean white men and black men, it meant white mean only.  That was a flaw in the constitution.   The princle of the constitution was and still is the best in the land, but it began the practice of it began with a major flaw.  

Is there anyone who disagrees?  If so, please respond.
