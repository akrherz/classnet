===message:I agree the government spends a lot of money of the government to pay for jobs or whatever, but it seems like we are spending all of this money on the government, and on the things that the country needs, but we contiuosly stay in debt, why cant we just use some of the money to give ourselves some added relief? Its just a thought.

===message:Hry Bonita. You made some good points that i agreed with. The nullification crisis was due to the fact that the federal government refused to turn down the tariffs and they knew quite alright that it was going to affect the southern states economy because they based on agriculture. And being that the government refused to turn down the tariffs, the southern states refused to accept the law.

===message:I do not think the federal goverment deliberately made the restrictions to be higher in any particular region at the time. The issue of tarriffs was a pure goverment decision, designed to enhance the continuation of the institution of governance.The Southerners however felt it's negative side more than the North because of the nature of their economy which was based mainly on cheap source of labor  with lower productivity compared to the mechanised system in the North.

===message:I think South Carolina had good justification as to why they refused to accept the tariff law. It was unfair to the Southern states to have that tax opposed upon them. It was not giving them any room for profit or growth.
