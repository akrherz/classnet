===message:Hey Candy. I can agree with you that the whites were maltreating the blacks because they thought the blacks would kill them. I mean, why won't they think like that. Because they've killed a lot of blacks and turned them to slavery, now they are afraid of blacks. If their conscience were clear, I do not see the reson why they should be afraid of blacks after maltreating them. I gues the white people think the blacks would pay them back for what evil they paid them.
