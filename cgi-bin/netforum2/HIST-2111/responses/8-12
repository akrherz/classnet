===message:I agree that the black civil rights and women rights were not linked because they were for two completely different reasons. At one time it was a double jeorpardy to be "Black" and a "Black women". So, for Stewart to speak in public, many considered her to be nothing but a joke. The text it self states that "nobody" not even African American males took her seriously and she was ignored by all races.

===message:I do see your point.  No way can you completely compare the two movements, but I do think the underlying principle still stands; inequality was at hand.
