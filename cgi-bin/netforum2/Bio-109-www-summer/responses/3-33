===message:I know that the the USA has plenty of corn but that is they arent smart enough to get a good marketing strategy.  If ethanol and other corn products were promoted more we could use alot more of this commodity in the states.  Insted we buy alot of our gas from other countries.  What do they buy from us?  Not much.  Why should we just give away our commodities that we have worked hard to grow are they worth nothing.  If so why was there a 5 dollar corn market if we have so much.  The market is poor now but there must be a need for it somewhere or their wouldnt be a market at all.  
I totally agree with the meat though I would never be willing to give up meat.
