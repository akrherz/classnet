===message:I'd like to comment on your thoughts for Proposal #1.  I really think you hit something here.  The problem is much bigger than just the fact that people are starving.  There are too many people bringing babies into a world that can't support them.  If these people could be educated on the various forms of birth control, it could help to reduce the number of children being born into undeveloped countries.  And yet, it is practically impossible for this to solve the problem, because if they can't afford food, then how will they afford birth control?  And who gets to educate them?  If the United States chooses to do something about this problem, whether it be by directly giving them food or by educating them on birth control or farming, it will cost the American tax payers money.  And I know that the majority of Americans would not stand for that.
