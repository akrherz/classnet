===message:I have to agree with you that we should not give our grain surplus to countries who cannot afford it.  To my understanding, your reasoning behind this argument is that, because of a population increase, there may be a shortage in supply. Also, you suggested that we trade our grain with something of theirs. This is called bartering. This is a great idea, but coincidental. They may not have what we want.   Maybe what we could do is barter with the countries that specialize in something we need. That would work out fairly well.On the contrary, studies show that bartering is somewhat nonefficient.  In response to the idea of population increase,I don't think we'd really run out of grain or there will become a shortage, because there are ways in which the market can control the amount being consumed and produced.
