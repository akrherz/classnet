===message:You speak of how we are stiffling these "poor" countries with the debt that they owe us? What about the debt that we owe other nations?  We cannot just allow our debt to continue also.  Did you know that if all the countries that owe us money would pay their debts, our national debt would be erased 2 or three times over?  It isn't popular these days, but we need to stop being the big brother to the world and worry about our own problems a little more.  Instead of helping the starving of the world, I would rather have my tax dollars feed all of the starving people in the US first.  Why don't we give our surplus grain to them?

===message:Yes, we also have a debt but the difference is that our debt 
is not preventing us from providing our citizens with food.  
That rests on legislators that vote against food stamp and 
other welfare programs.  The debt owed to us by third world 
countries would help pay off the U.S. debt but these are 
hardly significant enough numbers to justify keeping Third 
World countries from improving their living conditions.  Our 
government loves to talk about a global economy but it 
really isn't global if we leave these countries, who truly 
can't afford to feed their people, behind.
I absolutly agree with you that hunger is a problem in the 
U.S. and it must be solved.

===message:Everybody seems to talk a lot about debt that countries owe us, and we owe them....  That is not the whole point here.  I am against giving the Third world people ALL of our surplus grain.  Maybe a little bit of it.  The real problem is that the Third world countries need to be educated!!  If we were to be spending tax payers dollars to help the Third world countries, it hsould be spent to try and educate them.  There is a story about when the U.S. sent a whole plane load of surplus grain to Ethieopia or one of thoose countries in Africa.  Do you know what happened?  We sent the yellow corn grown here in the midwest.  They let it ALL rot on the airport runway or tarmack.  do you know why???  They thought that the yellow corn would make them sterile, and therefore, they would not be able to have more children.  That is why we should be educating them instead of giving them handouts al of hte time.
