===message:I like the ideas you gave for Proposal #2 that suggested finding other sources of meat to eat.  But I don't think this is possible.  Sure, Bison, Zebra, and Gazelle may be better at foraging and feeding on grassland, but this is because it is their only choice.  If we suddenly decided to eat them instead of cows and hogs, then farmers would be growing them and they would be found inside fences grazing on the provided land.  And they would also be slaughetered as the animals we eat now are.  If this were to happen, the only way I feel it would decrease the consumption of meat is because people would simply not be able to eat these animals.  They may see it the same as if they were eating a cat or a panda.  They would just not be comfortable doing it.  And I think people would have more of a problem knowing that a Zebra was being slaughtered then they would if it were a cow.
