===message:Proposal 1: I don't know exactly how I feel about this issue because I really don't know much about it. I have a friend who is over in Africa with the Peace Corp and I know the conditions are horrible. I can't imagine being or having a small child and not being able to feed it. I think as a strong nation we should try to help other nations but I also think about all the problems in this country. It comes to the question of where should our focus be at? Should we help other countries when they are starving people here or what? I guess I would say right now we should focus on our country and try to improve it and if we have the money and the volunteers then give free food but if not than we can't.
<BR> <BR>
Proposal 2: I am strongly against this proposal mainly because it forces people to become vegetarians and last time I checked this is a free country to do what you please (within reason). I don't want anyone telling me what I can and can't eat. I also think about the industry that produces meat and what will they do if everyone becomes a vegetarian? Also as I know it vegetarians still eat some animal products, it is vegans(not sure of spelling) that don't eat any animals products. I also think about what will happen to all the live stock we have now? With noone eating meat what will they do with all the extra animals? Also I think about our pets- what will they eat? I know for a fact my dog will not eat grains. Another thing is I know a ton of people have heard of the no carb diet- what will these people do? I understand all the benefits and how this could feed many people but I just don't think it is legal or possible to change this country. I myself only eat chicken and fish but I still don't think I want to be told what to do.

===message:	I just think that giving away our grain surplus to other countries is a way for the United States to have political power over undeveloped countries.  For example, the more money you give your friend the more he/she will use you for more money.  So that is why the U.S. has been a dominate force in controlling trade sactions, political power in U.N. meetings, and a driving force for feeding malnutritious people in third world countries.  It comes down to who has the technology and capability to make the most food and control trade sactions.  
	If I ran the country I would educate third world peasants on how to run sustainable agriculture and grow organic crops.  Spending money on food production is a waste, but allocating those fund to educational purposes is a more practical and appliable to feed people around the world.
	My opinion on discussion proposal 2 is that it is cool that vegetarians are resorting to other kinds of foods beside eating beef from cows.  I think bovids, especially cows are the most unefficient animals who have very poor meat quality and just the amount of calories eat doesn't turn into lean meat.  This is probably the reason most people resort to a vegetarian lifestyle becuase the way they think of meat is gross and not pleasing in a slaughter house, for example.  We should resort to eating bison, zebras, or gazelle meat.  These animals are more efficient in foraging and feeding grasses.

===message:Discussion Proposal 1: I don't feel we should give away surplus grain to other countries. I do think we could trade our excess grain for things that they have that we need though. If we give the other countries our excess grain it will affect our farmers and they are already having a tough time making a living. The family farm is fast becoming a memory and I think this would do it in for sure. Also when you give things to people and they don't have to work for it, it takes away their self esteem. But if they have something we need we could trade it and then everyone would be helped and feel good about it. However I don't think the excess grain should be wasted because that is wrong also.(BR)

Discussion Proposal 2:
Being a vegetarion is each person's choice to make on their own. This also would hurt our farmers. However I think that if people were made away aware of the facts about how much grain it takes to feed livestock to make meat maybe more peeople would consider it more seriously. I do think that most Americans overeat and that most people could cut their meat intake down. This would help some.(BR)
 Even if everyone did become a vegetarian there is still the issue that the people who need the grain the most are the countries where it can't be grown and so they have to import it and pay for it. So we would have all that to consider too. That brings us right back to what to do with the excess.

I somewhat agree with this statement, but not totally.  I think what we should do is instead of giving other countries our surplus of grain we should trade the grain for something that country has a surplus in, that the U.S. doesn't.  If that country doesn't have something to trade with us, I also don't believe we should let people starve when there is food available.  There is plenty of food to go around the world so I don't think one country should hog all the food.  We have many farmers in this country who work very hard to produce for everyone to share and eat the food.

Discussion Proposal #2:
I do not agree with this statement.  This is a free country and people can do what they want.  I feel its a personal choice whether or not you want to become a vegetarian.  I am not a vegetarian, but I believe if someone chooses to be a vegetarian that is totally fine with me.  As long as vegetarians respect my decision on not being a vegetarian I will respect their decision by being a vegetarian.  Like I said in my first proposal there are lots of farmers who work hard and many hours to produce the countries with food.  I don't think we are going to run out of food.

I am strongly against this proposal because I really like the taste of meat.  Also I think that a large part os our economy is based on the meat producing sector.  Think of hte people that would be out of a job.  The farmer would be out of a job, and also the farmer that produced all of hte grain for the farmer that produced the meat would be out of business.  Next the meat packing plant that packs the meat and processes it would go under.  There is a lot of jobs at this level.  Next there is also the shippers that ship the processed meat around the U.S. and even the world.  They would hav eto find another job.  Then last, but not least one would have to think about the employees at the local supermarket that are behind the meat counter.  They would also be out of business.  As one can see, not eating meat probably would have a devestating effect on the U.S. economy.

I do not believe that we should just give our food to the undernourished countries.  It is very hard to be comfortable as an American knowing the statistics of the starving countries out there, but I feel that if we simply gave them our food, it would be more likely that we would run out of food as well.  It could be possible if this other country had something to give us in return for the food.  But it is not this simple.  We have already learned in this class of how much population is going to continue to increase, so will we just continue to give more and more food?  This could, in turn, cause a shortage in our food as well.  We are already seeing a decrease in the number of farmers, and it will be difficult for them to produce the amount that would be demanded of them.

Proposal #2:
The government would have to pass a law banning the production of meat before this would ever happen!  I do not believe that anyone should be forced to become a vegetarian. It may be that only 25% of the calories in an American diet come from meat, but meat is also needed for important vitamins and nutrients.  A meatless diet is not a very healty diet.  It is possible that the government could do a campaign to encourage the consumption of fish over other sources of meat, but they will never eliminate it completely.  It is a part of our every day diet and has been  for too long.

I believe that the US government should give away its surplus grain to other nations where there are people that are need of nourishment.  Not only should the US do this, but also send information to these countries on how to receive better yields on crops by using different farming techniques.  The surplus of grain is doing nothing but sitting in storage and rotting.  It might as well be sent to some country that needs it.

DISCUSSION #2
If everyone became vegetarians then we would have a problem with an over population of animals such as sheep, cows and pigs.  Humans are their main predator.  We will still have to deal with their waste products. If we all became vegetarians we would be able to feed more people world wide, however, I feel that this solution will cause just as many problems as it will solve.

This proposal is a good idea, if a 'surplus' means this food will go to waste if it is not used.  The problem is how exactly to finance the transport of the food to the country where it is needed.  Trading with the other country may be an option.  If they have something that is a surplus, they could send that to us.  This probably would not be very efficient, but it would be a way to feed the hungry.

Topic #2
I do not think that we should all become vegitarians.  If everyone in the world did this we may have a surplus of meat and a shortage of grain.  If everyone was fed, there would be the possiblity that the earth would become overpopulated.  Anytime a major change like this is made,  a dramatic effect will occur.  Not that I want to see people starving, but I don't think that we should aid the overpopulation of the earth.

===message:Although allegations of selfishness can be made, the situation regarding a possible giveaway of surplus grain to countries that can't afford buying it is not a simple matter.   In many cases, the political conditions prevent the people in need in those countries of receiving this gift.  Then, in the case that this effort is really well-intentioned the United States would need to allocate the grain as well as develop and oversee the distribution process.  In my opinion, good intentions are not enough sometimes.  These may have to be accompanied by an operating procedure that facilitates the final goal to be achieved.<BR>
<BR>
In terms of the possibility of becoming vegetarians, I would suggest that this type of measure seems unattainable.  A more subtle one could be to limit (by legislation) the amount of grazing lands.  This could also have a positive effect in the global warming because of the known consequences of methane produced by cows.  Again, the depletion of rain forests such as the Amazon (Earth's lung) should be severely restricted.  It makes perfect sense if we look at the long range, since this lands will not be productive for long, but instead will be salted in short and of no more use.<BR>
<BR>
The point should be to take a look at solutions in the long range, but attainable ones.  It is undeniable that many smalls well thought measures could be taken with no large political consequences, whereas some radical ones (as all of US becoming vegies) are not realistic.

===message:Proposal #1

In many ways I feel that we should give away surplus grain to help feed those from countries who are in need or cannot afford it to buy it from us.  If we have more than enough of the grain we need, it seems cruel that we would not share it with those countries that are less fortunate than we are.  By assisting other countries, we are helping to save lives.  The fact that 40,000 children under 5 die each day from malnutrition and infection should be motivation enough to help other countries.  Also, one unit of grain can feed 10 people if eaten directly.  This proves that by sharing the additional resources we have with others, we can save lives and help to prevent hunger.
The only objection I have to this is that there are starving children in the United States who could benefit from the surplus of grain.  In many ways I feel that the needs of those in our own country should be met before we offer complete assistance to other countries.  This may sound cruel, but we could put that grain to use in the United States also.  I suppose though that the bottom line is that we should help those who are in need.  If I lived in a country where we needed grain or other items, I too would hope that another country would come to our aide and help as best they could.  Sometimes you have to put yourself in another person's place to really understand.

Proposal #2

This sounds like a justifiable solution to hunger and other problems, but it would be a hard task to achieve.  It sounds wonderful that if we all became vegetarians an additional 250 million people in the world could be fed. This is great but Americans consume a great deal of meat products and it would be hard to change.  Further more, meat provides us with protein and other important nutrients that have nutritional value in our diets.  I realize that there are many vegetarians out there, but I feel that cutting out all meat consumption may prove to be a health risk for many people who depend on meat for protein in their daily diet.  I would totally agree with wanting to cut back on the production and consumption of meat, but cutting it out completely and becoming a nation of vegetarians seems somewhat extreme. I feel that there are other ways that we can help feed the hungry.  It is difficult though to know what the best way is to help aid those in need and how many people would actually comply to become vegetarians in order to help others.  If it would mean that lives could be saved, I would do it. But to get 260 million people to agree would be a definite miracle.

countries our surplus grain would definitely be a step in 
the right direction.  I am not naive enough to think that 
this will solve all the problems for these countries but it 
is a start.  An action such as this would take a lot of 
planning and foresight but I think it would be possible to

with the grain.  "Give a man a fish and he eats for a day 
but teach him to fish and he eats for a lifetime".  By 
sharing our farming practices we can help farmers in these 
regions improve yield and help them help themselves.
PROPOSAL #2: Unfortunatly, like most Americans, I have a 
taste for meat so this isn't something I would like to go 
along with.  I don't dispute that keeping feed from cattle 
would free up more grain but, as of now, U.S. farmers can't 
even get rid of the grain they have.  The U.S. government 
restricts its exports and even imports grain from overseas. 
Right now the meat industry is the only way some farmers can 
make a living.  Grain prices are horrible and forcing more 
farmers to limit their production to edible crops will drive 
prices down even more.  I can't justify destroying someone 
elses livlyhood to help someone else's when their may be 
ways to accomplish the same goal without harming the

===message:   I don't believe that the US should give grain surplus to other countries who can't afford it.Just because we have a surplus, doesn't necessarily mean that every consumer in the US is being satisfied with the amount of grain that they need. To my understanding, a surplus is an excess number of supply. It may mean that every consumer is consuming all they want, but that is not ultimately so. A surplus occurs when a consumer is either not willing or ABLE to buy at the market price, so this causes an excess amount of supply. On the contrary, it also depends on the conditions of the economy. If all consumers are being satisfied, then I am willing to accept the idea, but it is probably unlikely that ALL consumers are being satisfied. 
   I am a strong believer in Adam Smith's idea of "self-interest". This classical economic theorist believed that we have to help ourselves before we can help others. I think that this idea is logical and effective. It is essential for our economy to grow and expand.

     I don't think that it would be a good idea for the United States government to give away our surplus grain to other countries.  One reason is that surplus doesn't necessarily mean that our country is satisfied.  There are always going to be starving people in our country.  It doesn’t help them any if we give away food that could be helping them.  As well, what would happen if we did give away all of our grain and we were struck with some kind of devastation.  Perhaps Florida again gets hit with a killer hurricane, in which they need help from the government feeding the children.  How would we be able to protect and help those individuals in need without any grain in reserves.  Finally, this is kind of an off the wall reason, but if we give our grain away and then enter a world war, in which we must ration what is left of the grain.  How can we fight for ourselves or another country when we can't even take care of ourselves.

Proposal #2:
	I don’t believe that it is a good idea, nor is it a possible idea for the entire country to became vegetarians.  It is not a good idea because every time that you try to fix something another problem usually develops.  If we decide to cut out meat entirely from out diet, we then must plan a way to provide the people with more protein.  This can be hard to do because there aren’t too many choices to go with.  Along with this if we decide to do this it means changing our eating habits and nutrients all together.  While this could greatly help some people it might be destroying others.  If people do not get the correct amount of protein and other amounts of nutrients we could be dealing with a higher death rate, which would create an number of other problems.  As for the other part, it would be impossible for the government to force something like this on the American people.  Frist of all it would not be practical in that it would be very hard to enforce it.  there are always going to be people to find a way to get around it. Also I think that there would be a very large rebellion from the people.  It is one of our rights to be able to choose what we want to eat.

===message:Proposal 1 is a very sensitive topic especially in a place like Iowa, where many people depend on the sale of farm products for a living.  I think that the U.S. should give surplus grain to countries that can't afford it, but this surplus grain should come from the fields that the government already pays farmers not to farm.  I think that its called subsidizing.  This would not only feed needy people, but would keep the farmers happy.
<br>
Proposal 2 is a difficult one especially if you like a nice T-Bone as much as I do... but I think that for starters people should start to vary their diets, not cut out meat completely.  People, especially Americans, waste an incredible amount of everything, from food to paper products.  I think that small reductions in everything would help the world far more than simply cutting meat completely out of the diet.

<P>
I dont think the US Government should give away surplus grain to those countries that can't afford to buy it. My reasoning is that these countries in time will become more dependant on us for their food needs which leads to added financial costs and ultimately our tax dollars going to fund other countries and taking away from development of programs and resources here in the US. And while it is true that Americans eat more than other countries in does not pale in comaprison to the sheer number of grain that would need to be produced to feed Americans and countries such as China and India whose grain import needs are starting to exceed available resources. <P>
<P>Proposal 2. We should all become vegetarians to help feed the hungry people of the world and reduce the environmental impact of livestock production. <P>
<P>
I dont think we should all become vegetarians just to feed the world, instead resources should be put into making more land avaiable for grazing, making harmful chemicals and pesticides illegal so it does not destroy the land. And like I said in Proposal 1, us becoming vegetarians to feed the less fortunate will work and do some good for the immediate future but what happens when other countries dependance on us which leads to increased production, which leads to demand which has been unheard of. Add in the fact that we would be losing proteins and that the receiving countries would not be receiving enough proteins to make up for years of malnutrition and hunger makes the idea very foolish. Instead of changing eating habits to vegetarian it would be more beneficial to invest funds into vaccines and other medicines that will allow these unfortunate poorer cultures to grow and fend for themselves, we should help them out but not give away everything when the returns will be nothing but loss for the US

I disagree with this idea.  Giving grain to countries in need will solve immediate hunger problems; however, this plan lacks the ability to solve all problems for an extended amount of time.  First, this plan will cause other countries to become more dependent on the U.S. for food supplies.  Which is fine for awhile, but what happens once our surplus supplies are extinquished?  The reason why we have a surplus is because our entire population is not consuming it all.  If our population is increased by the number of people in another country, this will change our carrying capacity.  I strongly believe that once the surplus is used, the U.S. will strive to feed the people in our country before the people in another one.  The less fortunate country will now be in the same situation it was before the U.S. attempted to solve its hunger problems.  Second, this plan could also lead the country to be dependent on the U.S. in other aspects which would cause a financial burden on the U.S.  
<BR>
<BR>
Proposal 2:  We should all become vegetarians to help feed the hungry people in the world and reduce the environmental effects of livestock production.
<BR>
<BR>
I also disagree with this proposal.  First of all, this proposal is assuming that all the hungry people in the world would eat the meat that the U.S. vegetarians are giving up.  In some malnurished areas of the world, due to the different cultural or religious beliefs, people do not eat meat.  People might say that these people who do not believe in eating meat will help feed others in the world.  Which is fine, but there would still be the problem of those people being malnurished.  Another problem to this proposal is that many people would lose their jobs if the U.S. were to become complete vegetarians.  Then the government would have to find a way to sustain these people.  Also, enforcing this law would be difficult and would raise government expenditures if they where to hire a special "meat police."  I believe that it should be everyone's choice as to what kind of foods they would like to eat.  However, if the U.S. wants to attempt to cut back on meat consumption in our country, they should try raising meat prices.  This would either lead to less people consuming meat, ultimately freeing up meat for other countries, or this would lead to the government having more money to be able to find ways to help these countries in need.  Either way, the U.S. would still be giving people the right to choose their own lifestyles, and be able to help countries in need.

I agree with this idea, because there is food surplus in the U.S. and average individual Food consumption is pretty high compared with other countries. Africa is of need for food to save the people from Disease and hunger. 40,000 children die every day because of hunger. It makes me feel that one piece of bread could save lives. A big chunck of the U.S budget goes on Making Weapons, if this amount of money gets redistributed to develop more advanced agricultural methods and increase production, then there is no problem giving grains to poor countries. 
<br>
Just imagine the scenario if there is a drought in the U.S and we ran out of food, would you rather that the other countries should stand still watching Americans die?
since U.S has 40% of corn harvest of the world and 50% of soyabeans Harvest and they count for less than 10% world population. This shows that there is an imbalance in the production and consumption formula. And this production needs to be consumed somehow. And since the U.S is passing through a stable economics, there is no harm if food replaces cash donation.

Proposal # 2:  
<br>
We should all become vegetarians to help feed the hungry people in the world and reduce the environmental effects of livestock production.
<p>
I disagree on that because if we stop consumption of meat, the animal population would grow larger and this would make the problem worse in the future. Even if we say that the consumotion of grain from Animals could feed  ten people. This benefit is only short term. because when we stop eating meat, We need to find other shelters for the increased number of animals. And if Animals get released to the woods or field, they could start grazing on the grains that we plant.

===message:I would first like to comment on proposal 1:<BR> 
<BR>
Ideally, this is a great proposal, but I am concerned about a few things. How will the US ship the food to these other countries and who will pay for it? This is a minor detail, but it must be addressed. Will big companies finance this venture in efforts to be more PC? Or will US taxpayers be forced to fork over more money to Uncle Sam?<BR> 
<BR>
Once the grain arrives to these countries, noone knows if it will be spread about equally for all hungry people to enjoy or if the wealthy or government officials will simply take more than their fair share? Many of these countries that have problems paying for the food to begin with have many more deep-rooted problems than just a food shortage or lack of funding to finance the purchase of food from other countries. Their governments are corrupt and unregulated, not all members of their countries have equal and/or fair rights, the people lack sanitary living conditions--the list could go on forever. The problem is so much deeper than just sending them surplus food. <BR>
<BR>
We, as the United States, need to first help them solve some of their other problems. Many of these countries are over-populated because of lack of education about birth control and the unjust treatment of women. If all these people were simply "fed" the problem would only continue with even more people having 15 kids and 5 wives, children dying before they were 10 and very unsanitary living conditions. The problem is much larger than just sending food, which I completely agree that we should do, but we should also teach these people self-respect and the value of education. When these people are educated, they can go so many more places and do so much more for the countries in which they live.<BR>
<BR>
In regards to proposal 2:<BR> 
<BR>
Again, ideally this is great, but many people, especially Iowans, would NEVER give up their love for red meat. I agree that Americans should eat LESS, as we are becoming a HUGE society in every sense of the word. However, it is unrealistic to expect every American to give up meat for good. <BR>
<BR>
I think that we eat too much meat in the United States as well as too much fatty food. If the government could somehow start a campaign/program promoting a change in diet, I think that the number of vegetarians would increase and the rate of livestock production would decrease. Sadly, we are in a rut of being a "meat and potatos" society but it would really benefit everyone if we could change that. Americans are fat and unhealthy and if we just reduced the amount of meats we ate, not only would we be helping oursleves become more healthy, we would also be lowering the rate of livestock production. More farmers would start producing grain and we would be able to feed MORE people with the grain that we ate than the grain that fed the animals that we eventually would eat. This extra grain that we produced from our slowing livestock production could be sent abroad to help the undernourished.<BR>
<BR>
Another benefit to more vegetarians in the US would be the reduced amount of pollution caused by the livestock. Our water would be more sanitary and the air would be more "pleasant" to breathe. There are several benefits to a world filled with vegetarians, but we are far from that day in time. If every person even vowed to reduced the amount of meat in which they ate and tried to eat healthier, the livestock production would surely decrease and all those corporations would begin to meet the "new" needs of the American people. If the demand for a vegetarian lifestyle became greater, more people would jump on the bandwagon and eat less meat.

===message:Proposal # 1 is a tricky idea to contemplate.  One would think a good person's first reaction to it would be yes, of course the U.S. should share its surplus good to help countries in need.  However, when really weighing the pro's and cons of the issue, it can be debated either way with pretty valid support.  On one hand, it is true that our nation is way more economically advanced that most other nations, and we do live "high on the hog" as far as food consumption goes overall. It seems that giving our extra grain to countries in need would be the only humane way of justifying our nation's wealthy position in some ways.  But there are a lot of politics that come in beyond the kind act of sharing when it involves an overseas relationship.  What about shipping costs to get the grain to other nations?  We all know that fuel is extremely expensive right now, so that's an added cost to think about that the national budget may not have room for unless some senators are willing to make some changes!  Also, if you can think of giving food to other countries as analagous to the military operations the U.S. provides, it is easy to see a trend that develops--once the U.S. makes an agreement to help less fortunate nations with military support, or food in this case, this is something which that nation's population will depend on to keep a steady birth and life rate going--and if the U.S. gets to a point where it is too expensive to continue, that nation's population is going to undergo even worse tragedy than before--like giving a bottle to a baby and then taking it away--that baby is going to be upset, because he depended on that nourishment.  So overall, despite my argument here, I really do think the U.S. should be spending a lot more of our national budget to ship surplus food to countries in need,because it seems silly that we fork out billions of dollars to do peace-keeping operations in Kosovo, but can't help peaceful nations with food.  But, as I made the point earlier, there are a lot of tricky twists that can come out of sharing, depite the virtue of it, and these risks might be over the limit of what the U.S. can handle in order to keep our nation strong at the same time.

     As far as proposal #2 goes, it's a nice idea, but I think it's just too extreme to ever work--no one would stand for that--it would have to be a law in order to get the majority of U.S. citizens to follow it, and then it could be argued that a law outlawing meat-eating is unjust, inhumane, a deprivation of human rights, or something similar.  Plus, it can't be ignored that a vegetarian diet, although very healthy if done correctly, can deprive the body of the protein needed to make hemoglobin and and that other anatomy stuff that I really don't know much about.  If the nation all of the sudden went to a strictly vegetarian diet, there would be a lot of sick people, a sudden death rate increase perhaps, and a lot of pissed off people.  It is a nice idea, as I said before, but a lot of nice ideas just don't work in a democracy.  So unless we wnat to change our nation's political basis and re-do the revolutionary war to declare us NOT a democracy, then this idea is sadly, just not going to fly with the majority of U.S. citizens.  That's all I have to say.  Good-bye.

I was under the impression the US already did give away a portion of the grain produced.  Maybe I was incorrect.  I agree that this can not be viewed as a long term solution however some short term assistance may be needed along with a comprehensive plan for long term plans to be put into effect.

Prop 2 US give up meat.

Not going to happen.  This idea goes against the whole concept of capitalism.  We have the ability to make and sell meat so we are certainly going to do so.  

Though it may serve 250 million people on paper, what happens to the millions of people in the US who are dependant on meat for their living.  Not just joe farmer who may be able to switch over to producing grain, but all the people who would be out of business completely.  When 25% of the caloric needs come from meat in the US, you can be sure there is a huge industry for meat from direct meat sales in grocery stores to fast food chains and restaurants.  The elimination of meat would cause major economic problems for the US.

 My answer to this is no. Sure it would help feed everyone alive on earth today, But when the plants population can not be surported in the future and the desendents of these extra 250 million want to have children what do we say to them, 'I'm sorry.'? In 2030 we will not be able to surport China anyway (according to the fact sheet) giving up our meat seems foolish. I say lets enjoy it now. 
This brings me to my second point. I like my grain feed meats. It's taster than free range meat.

I take this stance not because I am greedy or because I have anything against those nations, but rather, I think that there is a reason that those countries are poor and without food.  Nature has decided that those regions are to be put into an agricultural depression.  Human ignorance and concetedness (sp?) have given us the opinion that we can and will populate the world where ever and when ever we please.  Clearly, starving, drought-ridden regions are not condusive to human existance.  Thus rather that keeping people where nature has obviously shunned them away, perhaps we should convince some of the people to leave, thus returning the population to the carrying capacity.

As for question #2, Humans are omnivores.  That means that we eat plants, and animals.  We cannot deny what we are, and we cannot expect that the political climate in our time is conducive to sharing.  Clearly, if question number one exists, that means that there is excess food, and it is not being distributed.

The government shouldn't be in the business to keep any business afloat when troubled impact that market. The government continues to waste money on storage for said grain. Thus spending taxpayer money on something they shouldn't have bought in the first place. 
The best benefit the government could gain through the continued practice of grain purchasing is the gifting it to those countries that can't afford to buy it anyway. If only broke countries are the only countries blessed with the "free grain" status are given the grain; then it won't impact the forgein markets that the farmers depend on for pricing.

Topic #2 (No meat eaters allowed): I agree that if everyone converted to vegetarian way of life there would be more sustenance for all. Not everyone prefers to dine by fruits and vegetables alone. Changing the acceptability of eating meat or not eating meat only addresses the capability of feeding more.

   Perhaps if there is a surplus of grain in the United States, it would be beneficial to developing nations to provide them not only with the abundant grain but also with agricultural planners who could help the starving communities develop sustainable agricultural practices.  I fear that only sending the grain may breed dependency instead of self-sufficency in areas of the world where political and economic troubles prevent humans from living a prosperous, healthy existance.  Another factor to consider in sending such aid is the political state of the country and whether or not the people in need will actually receive any of the much needed food.  In the end, any attempt to feed the starving people of the world is better than allowing grain to rot in the bins of US farmers.

Proposal #2
     What a wonderful day when more people accept vegetarism as a viable alternative to a traditional meat-based diet.  I think it would be a great idea for more better to consume alittle lower on the food chain so that others may eat as well.  Yet, I feel that if all the citizens of the United States where to stop eating meat, we would have devastating economic and agricultural problems.  For one, unless measures were taken to transform the meat industary into say a soy industry, a large surge of unemployment would result as farmers of livestock lose their niche in the community.  Also, what would the world do with all the cows, chickens, and pigs that have been engineered to have little purpose other than to eat and reproduce.  A sudden overpopulation of livestock would destroy the land by overgrazing.  Eventually, a massive slaughter/bonfire would need to take place to eradicate the "livestock pests," so wouldn't it be more beneficial if a few people in the US just continued to eat meat, even if only on occasion.  Perhaps the most logical plan involves a moderate balance between carnivores and herbivores.  I believe it would be wonderful if a majority of people gave up meat to feed the world, but I think meat-eaters have their place on the food chain as well.
