===message:Hunington's Disease:

If I found out that my parents had the disease I believe that I would have myself checked.  If I found out that I was going to die at the age of 50 I believe I would live my life differently.  I probably would not get married nor would I want to have children if I knew I would die early.  




Dog dies:

I dont think that it would be right to clone a dog because you liked that pet so much.  First of all, it is not like you will pick up where you left off at.  This new dog wont recognize you or have any memory of ever being a part of your family.  Even if this dog looks the same I don't believe that it will necesarily act the same.  I don't agree with cloning a dog or a family pet.

Child Killed:

I believe that this is also wrong.  Again, it will not be like you are continueing your childs life.  You can not replace the child you lost.  If you clone the child it will look the same and maybe act the same, but I believe a person would still feel a loss for the child that was killed.  You are not bringing the child back to life, you are creating another one.  

Einstein's Brain:

This situation does not bother me.  I dont know how much I agree with people playing God, but I would be in favor of something like this.  It has a possibility to help the human race.

Making MJ:

I Think this is a ridiculous idea.  I don't want to watch reruns for as long as I live of Michael Jordan.  Cloning Humans specificaly for money purposes is not something I agree with at all.

===message:1) I personally would not want to be tested for Huntington's disease.  I believe in a qualitative life, and not a quantative life.  I think that if I found out that I had the disease and my days were numbered, I would lose all drive in my life and adopt a who cares about all of it attitude because I am going to die anyway.  If I found out that I had it, and I was no married, then maybe finding a mate would be kind of hard to do.  The prospective mate might be gunshy about getting married to a man that could make 50% of her offspring have Huntington's disease.  I also am a believer that when it is your time to go, then it is just your time.  Live every day to its fullest, and when you die it will not be in vain or with any regrets.

2)My answer for all senarios is NO!!!!!  I do not believe that cloning is the answer.  cloning a dead child is not the answer.  When cloning the child you are not remembering the child, you are just making a copy of it.  Also the child would not have the memories/capabilities of the five year old.  You would have ot teach it all over again form an infant.  I think that is just morally worng to do.  Now with the dead family pet.  I also think that it would be worng in this case because another dog could be gotten and make the owners happy again. This would not take up the place of the other dog, but it would create new memories for the owners and ease some pain.  Cloning Micheal Jordan is also wrong.  That is for a profit for the benefit of somebody.  Also, what is the clone does not want to play basketball?  Then that would be a real problem.  It is a wrong thing to do.  Cloning Albert Einstein would be wrong.  Don't get me wrong the man was a great scientist, but we have more of him around these days that are continuing his studies further.  Coming down to it all I think that cloning is a bad idea for complete organisms.  Now to clone a heart or kidney for donation purposes is a whole new ball of wax.

===message:I am replying to the scenario of one of my parents having Huntington's disease. I'm not sure what I would do. It would be hanging over you whether you knew if you had it or not. I would probably be tested because then I would know and could deal with it. If you knew then maybe there are some things that you really wanted to do that you would do right away instead of putting them off until tomorrow. I think it would only be fair for your future spouse to know, because maybe this is something they know they could not deal with. If you are honest from the begining about it you may be able to work it out or just know it isn't going to work.
Discussion Topic 2:
I don't think cloning is acceptable in any case. It is scarey to think what people might do with it. I guess my religion gets in the way of accepting it. Cloning a child that has died seems like a real denial of what has happened.
We need to accept things as best we can and get on with life. Even if the child died and a new one is cloned it still isn't the same person, even if the genetic makeup is the very same. The same thing goes for replacing a pet. As far as using it to clone very smart people like Albert Einstein-I think that is wrong too. We have become a very impatient society and want things too fast. Things mean so much more when you work for it - you get the self satisfaction of know you accomplished something. We need people to be different and to contribute different things. Maybe Albert Einstein already contributed everything he was able to contribute.
And as far as sports go we are already putting too much money and emphasis on this. Yes, they are fun to watch but here again it is much more satisfying to become a sports star by working at it and knowing you did it yourself than by being molded by some genes.

===message:Discussion 1: I think I would be tested if for any other reason to ensure that I knew what I would be dying of and not to take anything for granted. It would put me at piece becasue I know I would have to make everyday worth living. The sooner I realize and deal with what is going on the better it will be for me, my family, and my loved ones. I dont know if I would get tested before I got married because nobody in my family has ever had it and to me it seems as if it was a disease that can affect many than they would add the test to your physical or regular checkup.<P>

Discussion 2:
<P>
Scenario 1: I would not have my dog recloned, for one reason and one reason only, it is not the nature of life. Thigns are born, they live, and then they die. Should we begin recloning people/pets because a higher power (not necessarily god) has choosen for them to pass away can be very dangerous to the way our lives and out society as a whole works.
<P>
Scenario 2: This is a tough one, while I say I would not reclone my child it would probably be a lie because I press you to find one parent who would be able to give up the chance at getting their child back. At the same time though this child would not have the same memories, they may not act the same. To me this is just like Scenario 1 where a higher power has decided that it was this childs time and it should not be questioned, all things happen for a reason.
<P>
Scenario 3: I do not think it would be a good idea to clone Albert Einstein, mainly because if you can make one you can make another and that could lead to other countries obtaining and Einstein clone, with the chemical weapons and other life ending chemicals/weapons out there who is to say we would benefit from his genius, we could very well be destroyed by it
<P>
Scenario 4:Again, cloning Micheal Jordan is not a good idea. Athletes are trained to do well, they have to work hard at it, they have to prepare, and learn that it is not as easy as they show on TV. To clone Micheal Jordan would ruin the sport itself because who is to say you would not then clone other star athletes and then the entire concept of competition is gone as well as the idea of hard work and reaching for your goals.  Plus it is not being done or thought of in an even remotly good natured honest way, it would be done for money and that is just wrong, its one thing to manipulate people for money, it is another to manipulate life for money, the clones might just as well be slaves because that is what they would be created for

THis test doesn't put an exact day on my death plus I don't fear what comes after death so if it is early then fine.  But I wouldn't want to be wasting it worrying about personal appearance or what other people think, but rather for what it is worth.
Topic 2.  I don't think I would want to do any cloning as of right now.  It may be a better idea in the future when it is better controlled.  I think that if we clone a person to be who they were before is tragic for that person because of the new environment that they are in.  If Albert Einstein was cloned and lived here again doesn't mean that he may want to be studying all the time.  He may be smart but with so many environmental factors he may just want to sit under an unbrella in the Carribean and enjoy life because on 1 different factor that he encountered in his life.  SO for right now I don't think that cloning kids or basketball stars is good.

If I knew my parents had this disease, I would be tested.  Some people might say that knowing would hang over your head, but in my opinion so would not knowing.  I wouldn't be able to enjoy my life if I knew that all my work might be for nothing because I might not get the chance to enjoy my accomplishments.  If I knew whether or not I had the disease, I would live a more active life.  I would do all the things that under normal circumstances I would put off, saying that I could do it some other time.  Also, knowing early enough would give me time to adjust to this inevitable future.  While this news might bother me at first, I would be able to accept it if I new in advance to the disease setting in.  Another reason why I would want to know is so I would be able to discuss this with a possible spouse.  I feel that if you love the person enough, they should be informed of this condition.  Perhaps they wouldn't want to have children that might possibly get the disease, or maybe they would not want to continue your relationship in order to spare themselves the heartache they would feel later, or maybe they would want to spend every possible minute with you in order to make you forget about this dismal future.  
<BR>

Discussion 2:
<BR>
<BR>
Scenario 1:  I would not have my pet cloned.  For one reason, the pet wouldn't be the same.  There is the possibility that the dog would not have the same personality, and habits that you loved.  Also, the pet might not "connect" with you and your family the way the other dog did.  This would leave a person with an even greater feeling of loss.  Another reason why I wouldn't have my dog cloned is because if people were meant to have the power over life and death, we would be able to do so without the help of science.  We would be able to snap our fingers and have the person/animal come back to life.  Without this ability, I feel that for some reason we aren't supposed to have this power.
<BR>
<BR>
Scenario 2:  While I wish I were able to say that I wouldn't clone my child, that would be a lie.  No parent would say no to cloning their child.  Unfortunately, doing this will lead to the same problems as Scenario 1.  I don't think this is right, and I don't think this should be given as an option to anyone.  However, I know that my love for my child would overcome any rational thoughts.  I would only want for that child to come back, to ease my pain and suffering.  This is self centered, but I would like to find a person that would put thoughts of their heartache, pain, suffering, and emotional anguish, out of their minds and think only of what is right and wrong.   
<BR>
<BR>
Scenario 3:  Again, I do not support cloning.  While on the surface, cloning a genius like Albert Einstein might seem a good idea, but it could lead to problems.  What if Einstein used his genius to destroy the world?  Or, what if Einstein found out that his theories were actually wrong?  Would the world want to accept the fact that Einstein was wrong?  Also, what if Einstein didn't retain any of his memories?  Wouldn't that mean that all of the information he had learned in his life would be forgotten?  Wouldn't that ultimately make him not a genius, taking away his ability to do good for humanity, the very reason why he was cloned?
Again, I believe that if people were meant to bring things back to life, they would have the ability to do it with the snap of their fingers.  
<BR>
<BR>
Scenario 4:  Sports are fun to watch and participate in, but what is the fun of watching the same people make the same accomplishments?  If multiple Michael Jordans were cloned, wouldn't they eventually end up playing themselves?  This would lead to a very boring game to watch.  Also, this would take away from anyone else's chances of becoming a great sports star.  What if someone was born with the potential of being a better basketball player than Michael Jordan, but because the sports industry is clogged with MJ clones, this person never gets the chance to play basketball?  Also, what if the new MJs didn't want to play sports?  Or, what if they didn't retain MJ's memory?  Then, they would run the risk of not knowing how to play basketball, or not being coordinated enough for the sport.  All of these possibilities aside, no person should be exploited for someone else's gain.  These clones would be at the mercy of the man who cloned them.  What would happen if this person was unhappy with their performance?  Since the person had the ability to make all these MJ clones, would the person then feel like they had control over life and death of the clones?  Would they decide to kill a clone that wasn't performing and replace it with one that would?  Once again, I stand firm with my belief that no person should have this power because if we were meant to have it, we would be born with it.

I think it would be terribly difficult to know what could very likely be awaiting me.  Especailly, after watching a parent go through the horrible agony.  If, however, I decided I wanted to have a child I would get tested.  I would not want to take any chance of passing that on.  On the other hand to be taested and test negative for the disease would be such a relief.  Perhaps if found out I tested possitive I would decide to live life to the fullest and try to help people and make a difference in the amount of time I had.  When I think more about it not knowing could be worse than knowing.  It least when you know you can begin to deal with it and move on.
Questuion 2.  I don't think cloning is every the answer.  Cloning the dog is not the solution.  Part of life is losing things.  Not every unplaesant thing can have a quick fix, easy solution.  Cloning the child is absurd.  Just because you clone the child doen's mean she will be exactly the same.  Part of what makes us unique is our enviroment and experiences.  The clone child would not be the same as the child who was lost.  Also I think that human cloning is not something we should mess.  Some things are sacred and just should not be done.  Ane once again the pain of losing those we love is part of life, no matter when they leave us.  Cloning Micheal JOrdon illustrates some of the ehtical concerns about cloning. THis cloning for such superficial reasons takes away the sacredness of human life.  It makes humans mere commodities and devalues all life.

===message:1)    I think that I would want to be tested for Huntington's disease if I found out that one of my parents had it.  It would probably be one of the most difficult things I would ever do, but at least I could have more time to prepare myself for it and for those around me to prepare for it.  Of course, I would be very happy if I found out I did not carry the disease.  And if I found out that I did carry Huntington's disease, then I would do everything I could to enjoy my life while I was living.  And I would do everything possible to make it easier on those who love me.  And I think that knowing ahead of time would make it easier in the long run.  Everyone would be better prepared mentally for when I started to show symptoms.  And I also think that if I found out I had it, depending on my husband's thoughts, I would highly consider adoption rather than giving birth to my own kids and putting them at the same risk.


2)First of all, I can't think of a circumstance yet in which I would consider cloning.  But I'll give more reasons why for each of the scenarios that were assigned.
Scenario 1 - This one is a little difficult for me, because I have never been emotionally attached to a pet.  But I feel that I would not decide to make a clone of my dog.  As hard as it is to lose things, it is a fact of life.  I thing the wisest thing would be for my family to go together and pick out a new pet to replace our lost dog.
Scenario 2 - As much as I would want to bring my child back to life, I don't believe that creating a clone of my child is the answer.  Just because it would look like my child and have the same tendencies as my child, it would not be my child.  This clone would not have had any of the experiences that developed my little 5 year old into who he/she was when hit by the car.  I think this would just be a way for me to push my pain aside and never deal with it, only for it to resurface later.
Scenario 3 - Out of all the scenarios, this is the one where I would almost say yes.  It would be nice to have a brain like Einstein's around again.  But at the same time, people come and go, and they give the world what they can while they're here.  I don't believe that we should be changing the normal progression of our existence. And there are plenty of extremely intelligent people living today, that, as far as we know, could be much wiser then Einstein was.  He was living during a time when almost anything would have been an invention.
Scenario 4 - I feel that cloning Michael Jordan would be a really bad idea.  It would make basketball at all levels less interesting and much less competitive.  It would ruin our spirit of competition and desire to strive for excellence.  Especially at the high school level, where sports are so important to the development of teenagers.  Plus, Michael Jordan does NOT need any more money.

If one of my parents had huntington's disease, I would be tested.  But I wouldn't want to be tested right away.  I would probably  try to continue life as normal until I decided to have children.  Then I would definately get tested.  A 50/50 chance is ok for me, but it is not ok for my children.  I would most likely choose not to have children if I tested positive and there is the chance they may get the disease.  
Discussion 2
I do not think that any of these senerios justify cloning.  Humans have always been unique because we are all different.  No one person is exactly like another.  I think cloning humans can only lead to a total loss of individuality.  Society has already put too much emphasis on having fancy material things.  I cannot imagine the impact if cloning helped put emphasis on having "fancy" humans.  Increased intelligence, good physical appearance, and high athletic ability are all nice things to have, but they are not necessary for every human to be a productive member of society.

Discussion Topic 2:
 To all of the cloning scenarios I say no.  Personally I don't agree with cloning.  And when a child or family pet dies, grieving the loss of a loved one is a part of life.  Everyone needs to go through the grieving process in their lifetime.  When you clone people or animals they aren't necessarily going to be the same as you remember them.  They may look the same on the outside, but inside they are going to be different.

If one of my parents were found to have Huntington's disease, I would have myself tested.  In my opinion wondering if I had it or if I didn't would be more agonizing than not knowing I had it. Either way, I would then make the most of every day.  Of course that would be easier to do if I found out I didn't have it than if I did, but if I did, I'd make all legal preparations necessary and then live every day like it was my last.

I do think that it would be a good idea to be tested before I would marry or have children if it was known that I may have Huntington's disease.  If I found out I had it, assuming my financee didn't leave me when he found out, I would definitely adopt children rather than pass the chances of getting the disease on.

DISCUSSION TOPIC 2:

Scenario 1: I don't think cloning is justified when you lose your favorite pet.  To everything there is a season.  Nothing is permanent and part of living is dying and grieving losses.  That's the route I feel we should take when losing a pet.

Scenario 2:  Being a mom, my first instinct would be that we should be able to clone our children if they die.  But then after thinking it through more, that child would not be the same as the one who died and it would just haunt you because the cloned child would not have the same memories and learned habits as the original child.  The only thing that would be the same would be the body--not the living soul that makes a person what and who they are.

Scenario 3:  Cloning Einstein is not a good idea.   We have persons living right now who have genius IQ's.  It is best to let the dead be dead and provide whatever resources are necessary for the living persons of genius rank to contribute whatever he/she can to improve the quality of our lives.

Scenario 4:  I love sports, but I feels it's best to let God create people with athletic abilities and then leave it up to the individual to "grow" those abilities to their full potential. What we are is God's gift to us, what we do with what He has given us is our gift to God.

I'm against cloning.  I feel using genetics to control diseases to provide a better quality of life for individuals is fine, but we are created to pro-create and it's best left that way.  If God wanted us to all be alike and to be the "the best" creatures in the eyes of man, he would have just created robots and left it at that.  Besides, I'm guessing that making babies God's way is way more fun than cloning.

Discussion #2:  1.  This isn't a healthy way to grieve 
because of the expectations that this dog would be the same 
as the old one.  A dog of the same breed could be found that 
would remind you of the old dog without the thoughts that it 
was the same dog.
2.  Absolutley not.  That goes against everything that I 
believe "makes us human".  We are more than just cells and 
tissue.  We have experiences that begin to form our

3 and 4.  Both of these situations are wrong because the 
person could never live up to the expectations that society 
would have for them.  The failures that these men 
experienced probably did more to shape them than anything.  
These failures would not be tolerated by the people who 
"own" them and it would probably end up becoming a huge

Yes, I would be tested. Not knowing is sometimes worse than knowing. At least if you knew you had the disease, you could enjoy what time you had left and do the things that you hope to in your life. Also, knowing the results would ultimately tell you whether or not you should have kids. If you didn't get tested and had children anyway, I do not feel that is being fair to that child since they too have a chance of inheriting the disease. If I got tested and the results were negative, you could live your life without having to always have in the back of your mind "what if"...
and if you find out you have the disease, you hope for a cure and just live your life to the fullest, although I am sure is not as easy as it sounds.

Topic 2

#1:  I think it's kind of creepy. I would rather just go buy a new dog than clone the old one. The old one may have been wonderful, but when the pet is gone, he's gone, and nothing is going to replace him.

#2:  Again, I would not do this. Cloning your child that has been killed is not going to make things any easier. This is a traumatic thing to go through. Trying to replace your child is only going to bring about more pain. A child that has the same genes and that looks the same as your first child may sound hopeful, but in the end, we cannot always just replace what we lose, life is much more precious than that.

#3:  This sounds good, but if I say this is okay, then it is just contradicting what I said in #2. I don't think we should clone his brain. What if it doesn't work? There are people in the world who are making great contributions to society right now and they were not cloned. We don't always need to look to the past. We have capable people who can make a difference that are living. Let Albert rest in peace.

#4:  Definitely not. I would rather clone Albert's brain than clone a bunch of little Michael Jordan's. I guess I am just stuck on the idea that every life is unique...someone like Michael Jordan has worked very hard to get to where he is today...he is a unique individual just as we all are unique in our own ways. I don't think people should be cloned...it seems to cheapen life and take away a person's individuality.

===message:Topic 1--If one of my parents had Huntington's disease and I was in between the ages of 17-20, I wouldn't have myself tested unless I had symptoms of it. Considering that 17-20 is a fairly young age bracket, I don't believe that I would want to worry about death. Also, there is no cure for it,so I wouldn't want to live my life feeling like my existance was pointless, ending so soon, and knowing I was not going to be able to achieve my highest goals that come in time. Some people may argue that they would WANT to know if they had this disease, because they would try to live their life to the fullest and this disease would serve as mechanism for motivation. I believe that regardless if you have a disease or not you SHOULD live your life to the fullest and get motivated to do want you want for your own well-being. On the contrary, I believe that I would want to be tested before marriage if I decide to have children. When someone elses life would be at stake, I feel that the Huntington's disease would be a major concern. Since I don't plan on getting married until after the age of 20, the answer to the question "Would you have yourself tested?" would be "no", under such circumstances given.

Topic 2-- I don't believe that cloning would be justified in ANY scenario. Although it may be beneficial to society such as in Scenario 3, I still believe that it is immoral and is a selfish act. I must admit that I have more of a traditional point-of-view and not the "new perspective" outlook in this particular subject. Cloning is a very interesting, but debatable subject. I believe that Scenerio's 1,4, and regretfully 2 are outrageous, if not absurd. Cloning affects the rights of the diseased and all the laws of mankind. I live by the widely used expression,"if it was meant to be, it was meant to be". Cloning is a great scientific discovery and I commend whomever or WHATEVER helped to contribute to this discovery, but I still am faced with the question of morality. Let us live, die in peace, and keep all of our characteristics unique and special as we go on.

===message:Response #1  If I was 17-20 I don't think that I would want to know anything about huntingtons disease or whether I had it or not.  I feel like it would drag me down if I found out bad news and had it.  I probably wouldn't be as upbeat and might even feel sorry for myself.  I realize that maybe you would need to find out but I would rather face it later on in life when I absolutely had to.
Response #2 I think that all of these scenarios are selfish and demeaning to life.  It is great that we have people smart enough to figure out this kind of technology but cant they find something better to use their minds for. Each person is an individual with their own personality and characteristics.  I think that cloning is selfish, demeaning, and really just plain sick.  I wouldn't want anyone to be the same as me and I should have that right.

===message:Discussion 1:  If I had a parent with Huntington's Disease I would definately have myself tested.  I think always wondering would be harder than just facing up to the fact that I would die from it.  In the meantime I think I would probably spend some of my time doing some genetic testing trying to find a cure for myself and others.  Being a parent now I also know that if I had the disease I would have chossen not to have children.  I would not want to pass a life threatening disease on to anyone if I could avoid it.<BR>

Discussion 2:  For all of the given scenarios I would have to say that cloning is wrong.  Losing a loved pet is part of being a pet owner.  You shouldn't be able to replace the dog by cloning.  It would just be a dog that looked the same, it may not have the same tempermant.  I also don't think cloning a lost child is correct.  I feel that my kids are beautiful kids, but cloning them wouldn't bring them back to me.  They are who they are because of the experiences they have had and that we have shared.  You can't clone that.  You can't clone their heart and sole.  Albert Einstein was a great contributer to us, but there is another Einstein out there waiting to invent something even more spectatcular. Cloning should not be used to profit from a great basketball player either.  There has to be some moral issues involved when ever clonig is involved.

In such a situation, I would want to be tested  so that I would know whether or not I should reproduce.  I would not want to risk putting my unborn children through a tragic death just because I was afraid to know the truth about my end.  Besides, everyone is a ticking time bomb of death whether or not you carrying devasting genetic material.IF I knew, I could live the life I had been given with gusto and prepare myself and my family for the onset of the disease.

Topic #2

Like I've said before, death is inevitable and part of the human experience involves learning to accept Death's role in Life.  While losing a pet and especially a child can be devastating, what sort of truths about existance we have to formulate if we could simply "replace" our loved ones.  Death is part of the cycle of life and learning to deal with it part of our experience as emotional beings.  NOt only must we learn to cope with death, we also are given a  natural guarantee that we are genetically one-of-a-kind.  I'm not so sure it is humanity's place to rob individuals of the right of unique existance.  What sort of mental disorders are we going to breed into humans who know that they are the 3rd, 4th, etc clone of Mr. John Smith?  Cloning humans seems to cross bounds of human existance and integrity that I feel should not be crossed.

I think that I would want to be tested just so that I would know.  That way I would be ready for whatever was going to happen.  As well it would give me a head start on treatment, so as soon as the symptoms occur I would know exactly what was going on.  Finally I would be more aware of the studies going on to learn more about the disease.  If it was possible to participate in a study that could save my life I might be interested in doing it.

Topic #2
I do not believe that it is right to clone any type of living thing.   I don’t believe that any human has the right to play God.  There is a plan for each of us that God intended to be for a certain reason.  Who are we to play with that plan?  I understand the devastation of losing a loved one or pet, however who’s to say that this clone will be exactly like that the other one.  The personality traits could be very different, which could cause some grief.   Death is something that we have to accept as a part of life.  It is how our world as we know it is regulated.  If we were allowed to clone everything that we wanted the earth would soon have too many living things to support.

I would.  I think it would be responsible for me to know if my kids could get the disease.  I would do everything possible to find a cure or promote the cause.  I would not feel discouraged or sentenced, but I would make the best of the years I have to live.

Discussion topic 2: Consider the following scenarios and say whether you think cloning would be justified. 

Scenario 1: Would you clone your dead pet? No

Scenario 2: Would you clone your 5-year-old child who has been hit by a car and killed? No

Scenario 3: Would you support cloning Albert Einstein? No

Scenario 4: Should an entrepreneur be allowed to clone Michael Jordon? No.

I think clonning is not justified in any case.  Each individual is original and unique.  Even for those who don't believe in the existence of soul, it is evident that identical twins raised in the same family are not identical in their personalities.

I have five kids and they are definitely not replaceable.  Each of them is unique.  If one of them is not anymore with me, his soul would not be here anymore.

  I would get tested, because then I would know as opposed to every day wondering, "will this be the day I find out?"  Getting tested would allow me to get on with my life, while not getting tested would make me live and fear.  If I found out I was going to be ok I would surely feel relieved, but if I got back a positive test result I would still be relieved, in a different way of course.  As for having children, I think getting tested would be benificial because it may be possible now or in the future to have a child and not have the bad gene passed along.<br>
<br>
Topic 2:<br>
   For scenario 1 I would say yes, because in my idea of cloning is that the cloned individual will probably look identical to the original, but its mind will be completly different.  I believe that even in dogs their actions and behavior are determined by life experiences.<br>
   I offer the same arguement for scenario two, although I would probably not go through with it.  I think that having a second child, basically an identical twin of the first one would be to painfull.  I would just try and have another kid.<br>
   For scenario three I say go ahead, this would be a perfect way to find out if a clone would have the same intellectual "prowess" as the original.  Just don't let one of the clones be turned to the side of evil. (Just kiddin')<br>
   Scenario four would also be a good one to go through with.  I think that the investor would probably push his "clone dream team" into playing basketball at an early age. Surely, some or most of the clones will resent him and pursue careers as shoe salesman.

Cloning? I do not think it would be ethical to do any of the senerios listed. You allow one for a good reason you allow all of them. Sure it would be nice to have your dog, son, or eninstin Back, but this also means anyone could clone you, or a beutiful woman, for any thing they want. Large evils could be perpetrated easily.

===message:1. I would get myself tested. But if a carrier and there is a 50/50 chance for my kids to have the disease I would still have kids. By the time I will be 40 my kids would become grown up and they can count on themselves. Besides it is not fair to deprive somebody from having kids because he/she is a carrier of a disease. Mainly every one of us carries a dominant or a recessive bad allele. 

2. 
a. I am against cloning humans or animals because the circumstances are not guaranteed. cloning a dead pet would be ok, if the owners are responsible for taking care of the cloned pet even if he has some problems.

b. I won't clone my child, if I have the chance to bring more children then I will do so by normal pregnancy. Cloning won't bring me back what was lost.

c. Cloning einestien would benefit wellfare of human beings. 

d. Cloning athletes is not justified because you cannot make an athlete. Cloning should be used for necessary needs not for personal preferences.

===message:Topic 1:  I would get tested for Huntington's disease if my family had a history of it.  The earlier the doctor dectected the disease there may be a treatable drug out there to slow down the progress.  If there wasn't a cure, I'm sure in a couple of years, genomic scientists would figure out which genes regulate the Huntington genes through the Human Genome Project.  This early detection would make me notify my spouse that I have it or not and discuss it with her about my family history.  My loved ones would be the first to know about any heritable diseases that was in my family tree imediately.
Topic 2: 
Scenario 1. I'm emotionally attached to a cat right now, but I would never replace him by using the tissue from it's ear. When the cloned replica of my cat grew up, the emotions of the cat would never be replicated again.  For example, two twins are 100% genetically alike, but their environment disposes them to act differently in their personalities.  So my new cloned cat could behave very differently.  If u could clone emotions, that would be great.  That is very freaky if you think about it.
Scenario 2:  Again, cloning behaviors is very different than cloning biological matter.  If the 5-year-old child was cloned again, me as a father, the child would have a different environment to grown in since time has passed.  By the time she grows up her predisposed surroundings would be different.  Not the same as it was five years ago.  So cloning a child would be irrelevant to me.
Scenario 3:  Albert Einstein wrote many theories that contributed to science today.  If we cloned his brain cells, what would other scientists argue about originality and creativity in scientific knowledge?  I think it would be more of an ethical issue.
Scenario 4:  The new stars today in basketball would lose their fame to this new Michael Jordan clone "wannabe."  Like I said before about Einstein, I don't think anyone can replace Jordan, even his clone.  There would be a lot of controversy in the NBA about who gets own the cloned Jordan and other issues about orginality.  By the time the clone grows up to be a new basketball star , his skills would be obselite and newer stars could possess stronger basketball techniques than the new Jordan.  Heck they should give me the Jordan tissues and transgenically insert them into my genome to make me a star!

Knowing what to do is better than doing something you are uncertain. Even that is knowing you are dying and deal with it earlier is better than notknowing when are you going to die. In fact, everyone hasto die, it is just the matter of time that how longyou can live. If the result indicates that I am normal,then my life will remain as normal as I was. Unfortunately,if I had the disease, I would get shocked at the firstplace, but I wouldn't act so passive. I wouldn't sitaround doing nothing and waiting to die.

Iaccept cloning, but only for pets. I strongly disagreecloning human. Animals might have their own feelingas well, but due to communication restriction, we hardlyunderstand what they are trying to express. Therefore,we pretty much ignore them. Cloning animals isacceptable to me, because we don't have to deal withtheir feeling. For my pet, the cloned one would have myold dog genes, therefore it looks exactly alike. I amsure after certain periods, the personalities of the cloned dog are also same to my old dog. Since personality determines by gene and environment. If both factorsare the same, I see no reason why the cloned dog can'treplace my old dog. Which is for me, they are the same dog.<BR>Scenario 2: <BR>As I said before, I don't agree cloning human being. Evenif I had lost a son in accident. What makes human different from animals is that human has it own thinkingand life experience. Especially the experience we have,which makes us different from each other. We mighthave the same experience, but our own thinking makes ourperceptive different. Even a twin looks alike, we knowthey are entire two individuals. Same as cloning and theorigin. The cloned one can't never replace the old oneeven they look and act so much alike. This is becauseof memory. We can clone a body, but never can't copymemory of human. <BR>Scenario 3: <BR>Cloning a genius like Albert Einstein won't get theresult that we expect. Albert Einstein had greatcontributions to the world because of his efforts.If we clone a new one, he has no memory. Therefore, heis another person with high IQ in the world.

There are so many peoplewith high IQ out there, but not all of them areworking in research field.<BR>Scenario 4: <BR>People seem to forgoten the purpose of participatingsports. Performance is important, but not the most.The spirit of participating is what we are seeking.Cloning a person with good athelete ability like MJwill against the spirit of sports.

We only live for a short time, and I guarantee all of you that we will all die, and whether or not we have this disease, most of us won't even have a clue as to when we will die.  The knowledge of infection may prevent our children from having it, and what then?  We do not have children?  We do not give ourselves a chance to improve the world through our offspring?  We do not give our children a chance to try?  We give up all hope?  We lay down, put our heads in our hands and cry?  Life is too short.  You know what else?  If you ever have children, don't find out what it is...  Life has very few genuine surprises.  Make each one count.

As for question #2, I do not think that any thing, anyone, or any part of anyone or thing should be cloned.  People and animals are given one chance on this earth... sorry.  Do you know any identical twins?  Are they exactly alike in every way?  Would you trade one for the other, no questions asked?  Well, there you have it.  Also, with respect to Albert Einstein's Brain,  what if the clone doesn't want to be a scientist.  Does it have rights?  Will it live past ten years old, or will it kill itself because it can't take the psycological pressure of knowing that it was engineered solely for it's mental capacity, and that no one in the world will ever love it for more than that of a flesh shell around one hell of a brain?

I would not want to be tested for Huntington's Disease if my parent was found to have the disease. I think that if I were to test positive for the disease I would become depressed and sad about knowing my own destiny. If I were to test negative, in one sense I would feel lucky, but in another, sad that my parent had to endure it while I got off "free".<br>
<br>
It would be terrible to go through life knowing that at a certain age, I would come down with this horrible disease and lead a slow and painful death. I would marry, but not have children. Adoption would be the only choice if I did decide that I wanted children. Regardless of getting tested or not, the fear that I would live with would be emense and I can honestly say I don't know 100% what I would choose to do.
I would owe it to my boyfriend/husband to tell him my situation and let him decide if he wanted to continue a relationship with me. Not only would it be stressful and emtionally disturbing for me, it would also effect the people with which I would be in relationshipd with. Many men would not want to put a "death sentance" on their relationship with their girlfriend or wife, not to mention the risk of accidentally conceiving a child and passing the disease on to them.<br>
<br>

Discussion 2:
I find it hard to justify cloning for any reason, simply because I am very afraid of what my occur as a result of messing with this kind of stuff. I believe with my heart that we should not clone humans and I am very wary of those who are in support of human cloning.<br>
<br>
Regarding scenario 1, I cannot agree with cloning the family dog. What is to say that that new dog will have the exact same personality and temperment as the old one? It will not have had the same experiences or treatment as the old dog. I think it would be an incredible waste of money and basically, a sick way for the owners and family to live in the past. Everything dies at some point and we need to accept that and move on. By cloning a pet dog, the owner obviously has some serious issues and cannot move on with their life. I would be afraid of what kind of "dog" would be produced and what would happen if this cloned dog mated with another normal dog? I think we are getting in over our heads and we need to seriously consider the outcomes of such a risky venture. Messing with mother nature is just not cool.<br>
<br>
Scenario 2 is even more sick than the first one. CLoning humans is wrong and we should not do it. That person has no say whether they want to be cloned and the cloned individual has to live with whatever characteristics they get. I can't help but think of the "Alien" movies and what happens when they clone the main character. We are really messing with nature and things that aren't meant to be messed with. We know so little in the realm of things and until there is more research and evidence of little things like plants, I am 100% against cloning humans. We have no concept of what all happens as a result of cloning and what may happen if the cloned individual has children with a normal person--will they be ok? I wouldn't want to subject any human to such unethical treatment. I am against testing on most animals as well as all humans!<br>
<br> 
Scenario 3 is yet another ridiculous attempt to relive the past. I am against any human cloning and that would include ALbert Einstein. He was a genius and that was that. There are other geniuses in the world and they will continue to come up with new things just as Einstein did. Subjecting any human to this type of "experiment" is unethical. The "clone" would basically be a lab rat and no human should be treated in such a manner.<br>
<br>
No person should be created purely for the purpose of money. Sadly, there are people out there who have no regard for human life and would accept such a proposition. Like the other scenarios, this violates every form of "ethical" treatment and should not be done. These clones would be humans and would have the right not to be a lab rat or a slave--which is what they would turn into after being "bought" and "sold" like animals. I am completely against it.

===message:AS far as the first topic, Huntington's disease:  No, I wouldn't have myself tested. There is a similar scenario out with diabetes now--my mom, grandpa, great grandma, and aunts all have diabetes, and there is a test now that will tell you if you are to ever acquire diabetes.  The thing is, why get tested, when it's going to set paranoia into one's life every day, when the disease may never even develop.  These predictory tests show if the gene is there, but not if the disease will actually start causing problems. It is possible to have a disease in your body but have it never activate any affects while a person is still alive.  Anyway...There's several reasons why I think it's going too far to pre-test oneself for a disease:  first, what is wrong with having imperfect people in the world?  Although disease can spread and kill of populations and all that kind of thing--disease is a natural part of life that controls the human population--it sounds cold for me to say that, I know, but disease is something that employs many many people, advances technology through research, and controls the world population to an extent.  It is something that it seems sadly, that nature has intended.  Yes, there is discomfort and mourning and tragedy involved in illness, but that too is a part of life.  I know several people with severely painful diseases that appreciate life the way it is.  Why?  Because there is something about human imperfections and tragedies that is natural and necessary in the realm of things.  I know I sound so cruel here, and I don't mean it that way, but honestly--why would one want to find out about a disease that may or may not ever show side affects.  Somehow it seems to me that finding out about biological imperfections before the natural time seems almost Hitlar like to me--like genetically engineering our world to make sure everyone is disease free.  I'm not going to bring the Bible up, because that's a weak source to use for objective discussions I think, but there's probably a lot of people in the world who would have some major relgious qualms with pre-testing for disease if it ever became a norm at child birth or something.  I know that in this world, we do a lot of things that go against nature for human comfort, but to me, finding out one's future in extreme advance seems a little too against nature. 
    AS for topic number 2:  Cloning scares me.  It's cool that we have found the technology to do these things, but it is scary.  There is so much power in the ability to clone humans someday--it could cause some massive chaos.  As far as the dog cloning--not so scary, but once again, it's reinventing the concept of death into an only partially permanent condition in a way.  I just don't agree with that, and I don't have any good support for why.  It's just creepy.  The Albert Einstein cloning?  Why not let someone else have a turn?  There's a lot of people being born every day, and I'm sure someone else might like to fill his shoes with the genius role.  Besides--I think that already, the last 10 years generations have obviously shown that there are others beyond Einstein who can solve the problems of science in the universe--uh, for example, whoever came up with the cloning thing.  The child cloning--smae argument as the dog, and also the above statements I had about letting nature run its course.  Already we interfere with death enough that people stay alive on machines for years with no brain activity.  Completely reinventing a life in order to avoid the agony of mourning a death is taking a very risky way out of confronting a normal human experience and emotion of grieving, not to mention helping to over populate our world wtih a bunch of fake people. It;s just all icky to me.  I think, as far as interfering with death, the current rate is about right--medicinal help and therapy--but not cloning.  Okay, that's it.  Goodbye.

#2 - I think I cna answer this question and all of its scenerios in one blanket statement that I think cloning for any reason is wrong.  I wuld definitely not clone any sort of animal because although it would be great to have a "dog" that lived forever people need to know that life shouldn't be like that.  The idea of cloning a loved one is also wrong because althoguh it is truely unfortunate that anyone would die so young the world would become overpopulated if people lived forever.

Even before marriage and having children I don't think I would test myself.  We should strive to live each day to the fullest... each day we offer new things to the world. Once a person reaches the 30-40 year old mark, there may be a cure.  In fact, before reaching 30 or 40 a person with the disease may be the one to discover the cure.  We should never underestimate ourselves- especially with a special condition such as Huntington's disease.

2) Taking into consideration the 4 different scenarios-  I would NOT clone any human.  The same goes for pets.  I don't believe it is just the person or pet, it is the emotional bond - the personality that is important.  It doesn't matter whether the person is the same or not, the emotional side of a being will never be the same.  You can never replace something once it's gone.

No I wouldn't have myself tested until I thought about having kids.  If I married and my wife wanted me to get tested earlier, I might consider it.

Discussion topic 2: Consider the following scenarios and say whether you think cloning would be justified. 

Scenario 1: Would you clone your dead pet? 
No, cloning is wrong, especially for such a surperfilous reason
Scenario 2: Would you clone your 5-year-old child who has been hit by a car and killed? 
no, however it would be tempting, in the end my moral obligations would make me not do it.
Scenario 3: Would you support cloning Albert Einstein? 
No again, I think that more harm than good would come from getting into that
Scenario 4: Should an entrepreneur be allowed to clone Michael Jordon? 
NO, cloning should never be used as a money making operation.

===message:1. I would definately get tested.  If I do have the disease, I'm going to find out soomer or later and I would rather know sooner.  I would be incredibly satisfied to find out that I didn't have the disease and would probably enjoy life a little more.  If I found out that I was going to get it, I would probably be depressed for a while and then live life to the fullest until I no longer could.  
I think that it is a good idea to get tested before you get married and think about kids just so that you can let your spouse know before you make a commitment, but if they truly love you it shouldn't matter whether you are at risk for the disease or not. 
2. Senario 1: I think it would be alright if you wanted to clone your dog but for myself, even if it is the same dog, it still would not be.  It would almost be a little 
freaky.
Senario 2: Again, I don't think I would want to just because it's not the same child though it is and I don't know how I would treat it morally but I can see how some families would want to have their child back.  Maybe I would think differently if I were in that situation but right now I don't think I could. 
Senario 3: On one hand, it would be a great advance in technology but shouldn't we let time take it's toll? What happens when we get too advanced?  What if they used their good for bad.  That sounds more like a movie but what if they did?  
Senario 4:  I think we should let time produce the next Micheal Jordan.  Who knows, maybe his children will grow up to be like him.  If we did have a lot of MJ clones running around, there would be something or someone that is bigger and better and then we would start cloning them.  It would just be a big cycle.

===subject:Genetic testing and cloning
===message:For the first situation in which an individual has the option of finding out whether or not they have Hunington's disease, if I were the person in this situation...I think I would get the genetic test done.  I would want to know whether or not my health is at risk and I would want to prepare my self and my family for the future.

For the cloning situations, I don't think any of those situations are justified for cloning.  I personally believe that things happen for a reason...and God would not have taken away anything that wasn't meant to be.  Plus, cloning goes against the natural selection process.  Every thing must be little different in order for natural selection to presist.

===message:d1)
Yes I would want to know.  With the advent of artificial insemination, and the fact that I can have a normal kid if I plan for it suits me well.  I can live with the disease with hopes for a cure by the time I die.  Having a child with the disease would be irresponsible on my part.
d2)
s1 no problem here, i see no ethical issue being wronged
s2 bad idea, the child would not be the same as the first, it would be the same as having a new child, just have a new one
s3 to promote the advancement of soceity might be a good idea, just once to see what it is like
s4 terrible idea.  why not produce an army of mj's.  or me for that fact, no longer a unique individual
