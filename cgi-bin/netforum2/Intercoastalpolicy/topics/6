===more:<p>Please review the material on Venice, Italy (you may 
need to roam around the posted site a little or even do 
a quick search for other web sources - there are 
many!). <br>I think this is an interesting coastal case 
study because it is so <b>old</b> and also so 
potentially <b>catastrophic</b>.<br> Please comment 
on how this case study relates to the material we have 
been exploring in this class. In your opinion, what are 
the most important ICZM lessons the case of Venice 
can teach us?
