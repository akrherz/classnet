===more:<b>Case Study: </b>Comment in general on the 
<b>Nuku Hiva </b>case study. Then compare the two 
descriptions I have provided. How was the Sail 
magazine story different 
from the Cruising World report? Which of the two, in 
your opinion, is closer to the truth (the perspective of the 
"cruisers" or that of the locals)? Why is the one <b>you 
chose</b> one more valid than the other?
