===more:<p>From the web-reading assignment: 
<p>"Respondents [to a survey]from <b>developed 
countries</b> were most likely to designate 
<b>economic development</b> as the reason for ICM 
initiation. In contrast, respondents from 
<b>developing</b> countries were more likely to cite 
some type of an <b>environmental</b> issue as the 
reason for initiating ICM."<p>
This seems illogical given what we normally think 
about this issue. Discuss why this is true and what the 
implication are for ICZM.<p>
