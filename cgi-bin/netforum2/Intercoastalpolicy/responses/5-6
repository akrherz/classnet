===message:Great comments! By the way, there is NO such thing as "correct" ICZM views. There are many, many alternatives to coastal development. What we want to do in a class like this is to have an intelligent discussion and we may each reach different conclusions about issues (as clearly happened with this case study if you have looked at the comments from your class mates!). <p>
You wrote <b>"I would have to side with the view of the locals. If i lived by little means on some pacific island, i wouldn't mind the opportunity to make some money, surf the web, and maybe see my island develop."</b><br> Good point. And that is why so many places are in fact changing. What we can try to do is help people and coastal areas experience change without destroying too much of it in the process. But always working with local communities, local groups, local leaders because it is their neighborhood!
