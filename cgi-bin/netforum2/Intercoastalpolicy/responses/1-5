===message:I liked your suggestion (in jest) to move people to 
Montana. Of course, it immediately raises another fact -  
there is also a theory (or suggestion) that we basically 
abandon large parts of the upper, dry Midwest because 
so much of it is fragile, not suited for agriculture and 
being wrecked by people. Sadly, every ecosystem 
seems strained these days.
