===message:Your comment that poor nations need an 
"intra-governmental approach" is wise. I would say that 
they also need an Multi-governmental (and probably a 
regional) approach as well to pool their resources. 
They also need to design "micro-policy" approaches to 
ICZM - i.e. to have (as they have done in China) many 
volunteer groups at the very local level of society help to 
maintain and restore the locl systems.
