===message:Interesting comments - I think you are saying that "environmental" and "economic" are mere semantic problems in the responses to the international survey data reported by Cicin-Sain on the NOAA web site. Maybe they should follow up and see if they can harmonize the survey instrument - they might get exactly the results you suggest. <p>I agree that the <b>end</b> (sustainability and preservation) is the most important value for us (environmentalists and coastal policy - ICZM- professionals). <p>However for a fisherman in Honduras it's probably eating and catching stuff to eat or sell. Also, as Lenin would say (the Commie not the Beatle!) <b>"the ends justify the means" </b>- Thus, if we can get people to implement sustainable ICZM by us hammering home the economic, income and employment benefits and advantages of sustainability, then let's by all means use those arguments as a tool to achieve the ends. (It may be harder and less successful to argue with that Honduran fisherman that sustainability, not killing sea turtles, not dynamiting the reef at Roatan, etc. is a "moral" or "good" thing and that he should do it because its "the right thing to do".

===message:Reading your reply, particularly the comment about the Honduran fishing for sustenence, prompted me to further consider the nature of the "offender" and the implication on ICZM implementation.
<p>
I imagined ICZM as a war being waged on multiple fronts, with the characteristics of each front depending on whether it was in a developing or developed nation. The different fronts would require different strategies.  This seemed to be a tidy way of differentiating between ICZM implementation in developing vs. developed countries.
<p>
In a developing nation, there may be 20,000 fronts, each one an individual fisherman trying to catch enough fish to eat and a few extra for the market.  This would be akin to guerilla warfare, where its hard to tell who the enemy is, let alone defeat, because of their wide dispersion and personal resolution.  On the other hand, the situation in a developed country must certainly be clearer.  The enemy is neatly contained within a large and easily identified coporation, an obvious and strageically valuable target.
<p>
But maybe the front in developed countries really isn't that delineated.  In Florida alone there a million recreational boats, many outfitted with dual outboards, GPS, and bottom-finding radar.  It would seem that the Florida angler is better equipped to wreak havoc than the Honduran sustenance fisherman.  While Floridian anglers are supposed to obey size and catch limits, many don't.  And even if they did, the limits are often far from ecologically-sound.  For instance, most U.S. states don't have any restrictions for shark landings.  And based on the fisherman I've known, you might have better luck getting a Honduran to take up sheep herding than to convince a 20-yr B.A.S.S. club member to trade in his fishing pole for a set of golf clubs.
<p>
And what exactly is the alternative to sustenance fishing?  They have to get protein from somewhere.  If it's not from fish, it's likely to be from chicken, pigs, or cattle, which all eat alot of grain and make alot of waste.
<p>
In the end, the distinction between developing and developed fronts seems a bit blurrier than first expected, at least for this specific example.  But at least it affirms that CZM issues are horribly complex.

===message:Once you get into the analogy of guerilla warfare vs. conventional war it does seem as though both types of warfare against the coastal zone are being fought in <b> both</b> places. In Honduras (or Belize, Mexico, Indonesia, etc.) there are also large corporations (hotel chains, lumber mills, banana plantations that spray pesticides, etc.) and in the U.S. there are also the BASS boat fishermen with 12-Paks of Bud.! Also, 2 shrimp boats (somewhere between an angler and a big corporate coast destroyer) have wreaked havoc with the reef at Ft. Jefferson, Dry Tortugas by letting it drift and rupture the fuel tank. So, yes, your conclusion that ICZM is incredibly complex is correct!
