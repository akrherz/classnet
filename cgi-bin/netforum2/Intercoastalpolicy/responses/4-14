===message:I agree with your discussion.  Which reason do you think provides a stronger base for ICZM?  What I mean is, are countries with an economic reason more likely to stick with it and could countries with more noble reasons be swayed by a chance at ecomonic gain?

===message:<br> I like your logic but in developing nations people in practice 
do not do a good job preserving the natural habitat. Often they 
plant in rows downhill (not across), there is serious depleation of 
species, plants are often stripped down to the bare bones. So 
believing the enviro is important may not necessarily mean you 
can actually practice it I guess. It is true that affluent people who 
want to "live on the coast" are often thinking "CONDO" not 
mosquito infested brackish marsh!

===message:I agree with Dr. Schmidt.  In the book "Green Planet Blues", which is part of the Environmental Sustainability on-line course, there is a great essay contrasting the environmental degradation of affluence versus that of poverty.  There are immense environmental dilemnas in both developed and developing nations, but the two tend to have a different nature.  In developed nations, things such as industrial wastes, damming of rivers for hydroelectricity, and beach hardening tend to jump to the forefront.  The issues are usually more "brown" than "green".  While some of the same issues occur in developing nations, "green" issues such as deforestation, over-hunting, and soil erosion are a more pressing concern.  There is obviously a lot of cross-over, but there is also a noticeable distinction between how the populations of wealthy economies versus poor economies trash the environment and why.
