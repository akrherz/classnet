===message:Your comments are interesting. In regard to Bolivia "...most of the country still does not have land telephone lines" but lotsa people are using cell phones - Many of us students of social change believe that in Latin America there will never be land lines to most of the country. Instead they will jump over that intermediate (and very vulnerable technology - thieves steel the wires for the copper, guerillas cut the lines etc) and they will go for a smarter, more elegant (and in the eand cheaper) technology like cell phones. <p>
Your comments on cooperation and the need to pool resources and information is excellent and exactly what ICZM is supposed to accomplish in the long run.
