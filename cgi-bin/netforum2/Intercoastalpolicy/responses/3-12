===message:It is overwhelming! The reasons we are usually drawn to such exotic and tropical locations is because of their natural beauty and wonders...yet often when we get there we observe things that make me wonder how much longer the environment there can sustain itself with the human activities being conducted there.  I observed the same kind of thing in Dominica, West Indies - the island is known for its natural beauty, lush green rainforests and beautiful waters - which there are plenty of - yet it amazed me to see that all along the cliffs that drop right down to the Caribbean Sea and river basins was SO MUCH LITTER!!! I would ride in buses/cars with friends there that are locals, and I couldn't believe that they saw nothing wrong with tossing all of their trash right out the windows.  If I would say something, the majority of them would just shrug it off, like it wasn't a big deal. Similarly, it made me realize that the pressing need for environmental education and proper management as well.

===message:The interesting thing about this is that Costa Rica and Dominica have pretty advanced environmental programs compared to most of the Latin America and the rest of the developing world.  I have observed shark finning in Ecuador as well and also share your Costa Rican turtle egg experience.  The trouble there in Costa Rica with the turtle eggs is that you are dealing with a cultural tradition of eating turtle eggs as "bocas".  It is hard to change something that has been passed down to you as tradition.  I also want to say something about the litter that Amy saw in Dominica.  This is a common trend throughout the developing world and we should consider ourselves pretty lucky to be so comparitively litter-free.  However, this did not come easily.  Our highways also used to be covered in litter.  It took nearly a generation of television ads "Give a Hoot, don't pollute" and other media to reinforce the idea that littering was bad.  Instead, we now use more trash than ever, but we hide it all away on landfills where it becomes "out of sight, out of mind".  I am sure that in Dominica the per capita production of trash is much less, it is just that they culturally do not mind to have plastic spread all over the side of the road.  The question is, other than aesthetics, is it really so much worse there than leaking into groundwater on a landfill?

===message: Personally, I don't think there is much worse than dumping everything into huge landfills! While I'm sure there is much more garbage, per capita, in our country, Dominica is also a very, very small island, and so the litter all seems to be concentrated in one place. But again, whether this is better or worse than having it be "out of sight, out of mind", I don't really know. The environmental education programs that have been in place there are, for the majority, very much concerned with the terrestrial aspects of the island. Only in the past few years has education about the coast and ocean life,  and the recognition that land and water-based activities and processes are all interconnected, been progressing. I am not sure if it is really a question of what's "better" or "worse".  I think the point we are all coming to in these discussions is that a lot of the things that we, as outsiders, may see as "problems" are things that may not be viewed by the local people as such, but are rather traditions passed down over generations, or simply just the way things have always been done. I think this is why management is such a difficult task, because it draws on so many different aspects - it is not just a geographical or environmental concern; but involves cultural, social, political, and economical issues as well.

===message:<br> In the discussion forum Heather shared her Costa Rica 
experience with the shark fin, turtle egg, turtle soup phenomenon. 
This is a sad commentary on human nature. I remember when I 
was a kid there were lots of movies about Nero and ancient Rome. 
The bad emperor whom you were expected to HATE always had 
big orgies and they would eat things like <b>hummingbird 
tounges</b>!! This excess was the height of corruption and 
badness! The reason they ate them was because hummingbirds 
are exotic and so small that you have to kill so many of them to get 
a decent snack. That made them especially desireable for <b>
EVIL</b> people.<br> It seems ot me that this is also what we 
should do with shark fins and other endangered species food - 
demonize the people who eat them! It's gotta become a culture war 
against them - not just some dry international regulatory issue!<p>
