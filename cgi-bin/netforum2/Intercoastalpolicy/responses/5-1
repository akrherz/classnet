===message:I'm glad that you wrote " I'm glad to have something to 
contribute this season as I share the true "behind the 
scenes" story of spraying insecticide ..." <br>I normally 
DO NOT assign trashy TV "reality" (NOT!) shows to my 
graduate 
students. But I think that all that happened at Nuku 
Hiva is "living" coastal transformation, so to speak! The 
same thing (in slightly different form) has happened to 
all coastal areas. <br>Outsiders come in with some 
scheme. Locals get jerked around - some like it; others 
grumble. And, nowadays Bulldozers are used!!<br> The 
impact of popular culture on coastal areas has a life of 
its own and all the sound ICZM, enviro impact 
statements, planning, etc. goes by the 
wayside.<br> Moreover, <b>there are some benefits to 
locals</b> and it is very hard to judge if they gained or 
lost in 
the tradeoff! <br> you do not have to watch any other 
episodes of survivor The Marquesas. But, your college 
students will now go there for Spring Break! Look out!
