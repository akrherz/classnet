I also remember when this was going on.  I spent my summers growing up in Ocean City, Maryland and vividly recall seeing the carcass of several dead dolphins on the sandbar in the bay behind my Uncle's condo.  I must admit that it was a very strong image, if only because it is something so unusual to witness.

===message:<br> Your epiphany with the dolphins is very moving. I found it fascinating that a deep personal experience like this would be so intense that it led you to choose a career! <br> I would bet that many of us are so passionate about smart coastal zone and ocean management because of an experience we had. I'll share mine some day soon.<br>
