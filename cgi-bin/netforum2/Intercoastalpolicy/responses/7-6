===message:I liked your comments and ntes "... worldwatch is also 
selling its collection of papers to you..." which is in the 
best spirit of capitalism and having the capital to do all 
kinds of cool stuff! <br> It is a new world though when 
"do gooders" are also selling stuff and trying to cash in 
- I was struck by your comment "napster clones and 
internet porn sites" as an analogy. You are right in 
many ways!!! The Internet has gone porn on us!!! 
Coastal policy porn! What a concept!
