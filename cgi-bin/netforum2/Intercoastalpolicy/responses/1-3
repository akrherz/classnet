===message:It is interesting how many different and fascinating 
arguments this class has raised as the Most important 
global ICZM problem - your arguments about 
technology (and Science) are very interesting. When I 
was on a small, remote place (Allen's Key) in the 
Bahamas I had rowed to shore to look at some 
endangered and unique Iguanas. Suddenly out of the 
sky came a pontoon airplane which landed, beached, 
unloaded a bunch of beet-red tourists each with a stick 
and grapes to feed the Iguanas. After 30 mintues in a 
roar of engines they flew back to Nassau in time for 
happy hour. No place on earth is remote anymore. No 
process (fishing for example) modest and sustainable. 
We really have the tools for harvesting everything in the 
sea and for deliberately or accidentally wrecking 
massively. On the other hand, we may alse be able to 
use this technological ability to make things right again.
