===message:I agree with Laura.  It is very important to put these laws in place to protect the coastal areas but enforcement needs to come a long way.  It is not an easy task to tackle as many people living in coastal zones are poor and lack the education to understand these laws.  They also are struggling day after day to survive.  We need to come up with funding to support educational programs so people want to obey laws.

their coastlines."<p>
Interesting! What is effectively? Does it differ from country to 
country or is there a global base line? I ask because I spend a lot 
of time in small, fragile, island (coastal) areas and I am struck by 
how much discussion we can still have on this. Poor fishermen 
and women may also be hard on reefs. But, if we get them off 
fishing and they work at a bar that serves the 4,000 cruise ship 
guests who are unloading every few days is that an imporvement?!

===message:Effectively….using the resources available to produce a better outcome however small or large.  When I first wrote my comments I was thinking of developed countries and now realize that I would have to better define areas to developed, developing or underdeveloped countries. And from that, determine if the area is indeed "effectively" regulating thier coastlines.
Poor fisherman and women may be hard on reefs but, with education and understanding of how to sustain an area for future use, they may be a valuable resource when it comes to protecting coastlines with their knowledge of the area and it’s resources. Putting them to work for cruise lines is an option but, not their only option
