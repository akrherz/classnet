===message:<br> You wrote "enforcement is a huge problem." Yes it is and in most places around the world there are either few credible laws about anything or the laws are unevenly enforced (or not enforced at all). Corruption is also a big problem.<p>
I'd add that in many places the laws (protecting reef marine life from commercial harvesting) may not match the economic reality of local people who will continue to break the laws (good though they may be). Some of the destruction of coastal zones is the result of structural and historical processes.

===message:I like your idea of stricter penalties for existing laws. Perhaps this can help make up for lack of enforcement by creating more concern at the possibility of getting caught.
