The old expression "s..t" happens might as well be "change happens". Traditional people often have adapted to their environment and in turn have adapted it (the local environment) to their needs. ANY change in their society or in the outside world insofar as that change impacts their society means adjustments have to be made. <p>For example, modern medicine and vaccinations have caused escalating survical rates and thus population growth in traditional societies. That alone can be a <b>MAJOR</b> source of pressure and require changes in cultural and economic (and ecological) behavior. Another example is plastics, trash, and other products dumped by ships or washing hundreds of kilometers to remote places. There is just <b>NOTHING</b> local people can do about the point-source of that pollution washing up on their beaches and mangroves. So here they need to implement local remediation strategies and change their institutions and their processes to cope with a new problem in their life. In a way this is not so different from them, for example, having to deal with a volcanic eruption on their island! (A natural intrusion but a big one!).<p>
Your example and discussion is excellent and to the point. However, Change (and "s..t") happens to most societies - I'll say all societies in 2002 - there are no untouched cultures left. So the challenge is to figger out how to modify behavior and make institutional (legal and structural) changes that will minimize the negative impact of all the changes coming from the outside. Your example is a good discussion of this predicament.<p)

===message:Hey Greg and Kristi,

Your story about the belief of evil spirits in the mangroves of Yap is extremely interesting in that I found very similar beliefs in coastal Ecuador. The people of the northwestern coast, along with most of the coast of Colombia, believe in a mangrove spirit called the Tunda.  This is an evil spirit that often takes the form of a beautiful woman and draws men into the mangroves with her singing. If you become enchanted by the singing, she draws you down into the mangrove mud and you dissappear forever.  Further south in Ecuador, the Tunda is replaced by a Duende, or evil dwarf, that will kill you if you harm the mangroves.
