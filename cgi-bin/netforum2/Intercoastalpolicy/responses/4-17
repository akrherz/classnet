government, etc. This is a tough goal to accomplish!" <br> I'll say! 
The juggling of case-by-case with larger global policies in the face 
of great economic/financial shortage in most countries makes this 
a really challenging problem. The reason is that often the global 
standards may conflict with specific local practice and needs.
