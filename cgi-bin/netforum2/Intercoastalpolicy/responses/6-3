===message:Wow what an idea! They could build a huge dike and keep the sea out completely and make Venice an artificial city. Like Holland! I think the idea of letting the sea in but not when it's angry (which apparently now is more and more often) if a very bizzare human response to a big mistake - letting Venice do some clueless things over the years that aggravated it's demise. But you are right, the last time I was in Venice it smelled but was still a magnificent place. The HISTORY is so overwhelming! <p>But, after all, remember that 2/3 of the world's largest cities are coastal and many may have "swamping" problems if the ice cap melt is for real. <b>Are we going to do the same for them? </b>I doubt it! One city you can save. Many you evacuate!! (I am in a cynical mood today!).
