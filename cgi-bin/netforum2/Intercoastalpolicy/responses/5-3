===message:Your reaction is exactly what i wanted! This is the way 
coastal zones actually change. All over the world. 
Including the US. <br>Most of the time we don't care 
and don't pay attention and it is not so sudden. I mean 
you actually got to watch LIVE on TV the results of a 
quick coastal policy "development"!<br>You also got my 
reason for assigning this exactly right. There are 
winners and losers. There are differences of opinion on 
whether something is "good" or "bad" (according to 
who?). And, you got to experience the fact that change 
happens regardless of whether there is an ICZM plan 
in place, whether people's quiet, island lives are 
disrupted or not. That's the way every place has 
changed (Hawaii, the US 400 years ago, and of course 
Nauru on which I have posted a case study on the web 
site).
