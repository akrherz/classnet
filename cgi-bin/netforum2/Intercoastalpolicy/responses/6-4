===message:Your comments are so interesting and analytical! I find it fascinating that once we buld a structure or a city it becomes, as it were, a monument and it is unthinkable that it woild ever desintegrate and sink or vanish. And, we are willing to spend whatever it takes to save it (that is also true of antiquities). I wonder what life would be like in Egypt if the money used for restorations over the past 100 yeasr had been invested in structural reform and sustainable development instead! <p> Were the lack of forward thinking oversight or ignorance or maybe a deliberate disregard so that they could continue to go in a linear direction?<p>You say "public opinion polls would fall short of optimistic" ... and you correct.Italians generally don't think anything the govt does can be trusted and the larger the funding spent the less! (I was in Rome this year!). Venice is an interesting case of CZM I think.
