===message:My apologies - I forgot to answer the question why did I pick this over other problems.  

I chose this because I think it answers the question: Why...
Why are there ICZM problems?  Because people's actions have impacted the environment.  Why did people impact the environment?  For food, places to live and work, electricity, money, etc. etc.  But there are other alternatives than the ocean to achieve/acquire all of the above, so why did we select the ocean?  Because we didn't believe it would/could hurt us since the ocean is an inexhautible resource.  We were wrong.

===message:Your point that we are extracting more than is 
sustainable from the coastal environment (I assume 
both wildlife as well as water, air, and space) is very 
true and it is the consequence of human behavior. Do 
you think the "ancients" were really commited to 
sustainability? Or, did they take as much as they 
wanted and could 
use (without being conservationists) but the 
consequence of so few people and so many natural 
resources meant that it made no difference since 
humans couldn't really ever make a dent? (For 
example, without 
refrigeration and massive trade with outher societies it 
didn't make sense 
and you couldn't store or transport the excess anyway - 
see Gregg Foster's comment above about the impact of 
technology).

===message:I did some research on energy years ago and it is 
interesting that 
people, like a plague of locusts, also harvested to 
virtual extinction, the trees around the Mediterranean for 
example. Also around my home town of Cali, Colombia 
all the trees were stripped from the Andean mountains 
surrounding the city for building and firewood during 
colonial times, leaving the mountains devastated and 
eroded. So, people have for millenia been harvesters 
and not conservationists in most venues! We are a 
short sighted species!
