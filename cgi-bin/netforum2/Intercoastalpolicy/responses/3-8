===message:<br> Interesting comments re. Egypt diving. You wrote "I watched the dive organization pay off the rangers (baksheesh) as we entered the park" -- so the Eurotrash tourists (Europeans are often trashy tourists who disrespect nature) could trash the reef. You are so right that often rules and laws are undermined by money - in Latin America it's called la Mordida..This is a cultural thing as well as too low salaries for public employees!

===message:Hey Michele,

This is just an awful story, I am just horrified.  However, I agree with Dr. Schmidt, it is rampant in the developing world and not just in areas of conservation.  In most places that I have visited, you can pay your way out of any situation or into any situation as the case may be.  Unfortunately, this includes the need to often pay police to make arrests or even buy them gas for their car and bullets for their guns if you need their assistance.  In Ecuador, I have also noticed that a lot of times it is the park guards/rangers who are the biggest poachers.  When you have 5 kids to feed, you make a salary of $100/month, and you grew up in a farming community, it just seems like nonsense to let perfectly good game meet go to waste because the rich American tourists want to take pictures.

===message:Thanks, Arlo--
I totally agree with you. Which goes back to the money issue. If developed countries cannot control such issues, then it seems as if developing and underdeveloped countries are doomed. I wonder in what way we have to approach issues in such areas where surviving day-to-day is the driving force in people's lives. I feel like the reason so many people involved in international management get so frustrated is because they are trying to handle issues in the same ways they would in the U.S., or Europe, when the reality is, such different lifestyles require completely different approaches. If only I could figure out what these approaches could be... ;)

===message:Michelle,

Sometimes I wonder if it might not be better to make all regulations in these areas tougher than they need to be.  For example, make all hunting illegal in huge reserve areas.  In reality, many species could probably be sustainably hunted.  Since the people are going to do it anyway, make it entirely illegal and maybe the end product will be the sustainable level you hoped for in the first place?  I doubt it, but it might be something to look into.

===from:Michelle

===message:I had thought of that-- but I think the problem remains with enforcement. If you make hunting totally illegal in an area, you need to up the enforcement, ie have rangers at all entrances, ensuring visitors do not enter with firearms, etc... It almost seems as if this would not do any good, considering these issues.
