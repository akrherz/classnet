===message:It's kind of disappointing that some people try to follow the rules but make mistakes or don't know some of the regulations.  What is worse, though, is those that know the rules, but choose to not follow them out of arrogance or some other affliction.

===message:<br> Choice words indeed! Imagine if educated Americans don't give a crap about lobter taking rules (and they are just doing this for sport) how effective these rules must be in places where people do this to survive! I am a big believer in having such inspections be conducted by people carrying big assault rifles, handcuffs, and some real threat of force for violation. Go to the gun range and start practicing - SCHMIDT'S ENFORCERS are coming!
