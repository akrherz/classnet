===message:<br> Arlo you have a neat perspective on this because you'd seen 
both the Third World and the Broward county version of this little 
story! <br> I suspect that you are right. And in your reaction to this 
you actually raise some of the interesting contradictions and 
dynamics of people's views and opinions on coastal issues. In the 
end, however, it does make a difference how people feel about all 
fo this if they are able to influence public policy and land use!

===message:I may sound skeptical, perhaps even a little embittered, but in reality, I DO think that there is a lot of hope for establishing successful CZM programs throughout the developing world.  It is true, I have experienced some of the negative realities of community development in the third world, but just because things are not always as they appear at first, does not mean there are not ways to work within the system.  I will admit that I think it is somewhat naive for us as Americans to travel to rural places within countries such as Ecuador and Colombia and take responses to a survey like this at face value.  The problem is that in many countries that have received a lot of attention from international aid organizations, locals are now jargon savvy and giving lip service to what appears a pot of gold is commonplace.  I have not been to a small community in Ecuador yet that will not tell you straight up that they want to develop an ecotourism program in their town.  However, I have visited very few who really understand what that means and are really prepared to have Gringos trampling through their forest everyday and put forth the effort (e.g. decreasing hunting patterns, halting deforestation, managing an ecolodge, capacitating townsfolk to be naturalist guides, etc.) to make it a reality.  Oftentimes they are just aware that such and such a town recieved US $300,000 for ecotourism and they cannot see beyond the dollar signs.  On the coast, you can easily gather a community of fishermen for a town meeting and get everyone to agree that a fisheries management plan and a marine protected area must be established.  You will not even have too hard of a time convincing them that the resource they are gathering is in danger of depletion.  However, my experience has been that despite what is said in that meeting and how passionate some locals rant on an on about saving the environment, the minute that meeting is out, the same people are back out on their boats pulling in the same amount of fish/lobster/sea cucumbers as ever before.  The bottom line is that they want to increase their economic situation and they are often viewing environmental issues as the wrapping paper for big multilateral donations.  The truth, at least as I see it, is that concern for the environment is an economic luxury.  Only once your family is fed, their health is cared for, social services are provided, and a minimum level of life comfort is established, can people truly expend the energy to care whether or not a species goes extinct or whether there is trash along the highway.  To say that the poverty striken are more concerned about the environment because they have a closer connection to the planet is rubbish (with the strong exception of traditional peoples who understand the conservation value of the resource that they have traditionally exploited).  On the flip side of all this, once it is realized that you are working with real people with real economic needs, a lot of progress can be made.  Successful, locally-run ecotourism operations can be created and conservation-based fishery management plans can be established.  However, these plans and operations must either present a strong economic alternative that the local people are 100% willing to accept (as it often will involve an unexpected lifestyle change) or it must present another form of economic incentive.  For instance, lobstering could be stopped (or at least lessened) in a given area if local fishermen could be trained in giving whalewatching tours, would be insured that only local boat captains would receive permits for such an activity, and be provided with a strong, tourist market for such an activity.  Otherwise, if there are mouths to feed...  I also want to point out to you, Dr. Shmidt, that I realize I am speaking with a bit of a bias concerning the rural poor.  The survey in question may have well been conducted within population centers where people are strongly educated and enjoy a much higher standard of living.  These people DO have a say in national policy and in the end, the use of their countries resources, impacts them as well (albeit not as immediate as the primary resource consumer).  Also, in many cases, you cannot base resource protection on the economic status of local colonists, thus the role of national parks and other forms of protected areas.  These areas, when chosen wisely, should receive prioritized national and international funding and protection and should be considered national heritage rather than a resource for local consumption only.
