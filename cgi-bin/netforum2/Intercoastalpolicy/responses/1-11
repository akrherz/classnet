===message:<p>. I agree that good laws are one of the most 
imnportant ICZM problem. <br>But I also would argue 
that <b>effective punishment, fines, and prison terms 
for violators </b>of environmental and other regulations 
are vitally important. Most peopledon't pay much 
attention to laws (who drives 55 or 65 on interstates!) 
unles there is some painful punishment on the horizon.
<p> This oil spill (Prestige Oil Tanker Spill off the coast 
of Spain) and the weird multi-national connections of 
the ships owners is typical of the <b>horrible</b> 
situation regarding ships registries. So many  ships 
(even cruise ships) are nominally inspected by corrupt 
officials in Third World Countries with almost no actual 
government (like Liberia).
