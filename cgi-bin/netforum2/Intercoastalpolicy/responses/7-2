===message:<p>As I read your intelligently argued comments it 
struck me that this may not be such a great way to go 
about the serious business of designing ICZM and 
sustainable development in general. I have this deep 
feeling in my gut that all of the peripheral activities 
distract from the work of government and IGO activities. 
<p> I noted a little cynicism in your comment "Let's not 
forget the Business Sustainable Development 
Global.com site." Is there some commercialization that 
may lead to nothing related to sound public policy? I am 
worried!
