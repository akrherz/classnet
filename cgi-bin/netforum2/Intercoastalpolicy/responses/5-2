===message:Excellent reaction from you (I waNted to get you excited 
and incensed)! <BR>There was a TV show a long time 
ago 
called "Father Knows Best". You are saying that "the 
locals know best" what's good for them. Maybe. Do they 
really understand the consequences of the changes? 
Will their lives be better? Will lots of US college 
students now want do Spring Brake on Nuku hiva 
(yes!)? Is this a good thing for locals and for local 
wildlife and coastal ecosystems? It is all very complex 
isn't it!?

===message:While I agree that locals rarely understand the ramifications of changing the coastal environment, I still stand by their right to decide in the end.  In this specific situation, the locals were likely forced into an already determined answer because of the money CBS brought to those who were actually going to make the final decision.  In other situations though, I think with proper information from managers and the insight of the locals, those in decision making positions could make the right decision.  If locals are given the information to understand which changes are going to result in a boom and bust economy that will in the end hurt them more than help, vs. a slow development with attention to the health of the environment, while not as quick in the end will benefit them the most, I stick by my belief that they will make the right decision.  This is likely naive and optimistic, but it could be true, right?  I don't see the moral difference between making them take our culture and not allowing them access to the technology that makes our culture what it is.  While this a tricky situation because of the big money in the form of a US TV show involved, hopefully in other situations locals can consider environmental and economic issues before making a decision on their land.

===message:You are absolutely correct when you write <b>"I still stand by their [local people's] right to decide in the end." </b>That is the way the world is - local people should be empowered. <br>But also remember that the people in Belize (locals) invited the rich American developer who built the resort and golf course on the reef! <br>In fact, in every place where the coast has been "developed" it is locals who want and get the jobs and they do need some new sources of income (tourism, shrimp farming, ecotourism, or whatever).<br>
I guess we as ICZM specialists can help educate and train the local population <b>so that they manage the change (which is inevitable) in a wise and sustainable way.</b> So we have our work cut out for us and I think that is so great! People Rule! (wisely we hope)!
