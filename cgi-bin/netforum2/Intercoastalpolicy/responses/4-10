===message:  I actually agree with you on your idea of developed countries being on the leading edge of technology.  Developed countries make techno. advances and quickly use implement them into policy making.  The US for example, for years, we have made quick decisions without knowing the future ramifications.  The draining, dredging and damming of the Everglades is a prime example.  The ecosystem was altered to benefit human growth in South Florida.  Only recently have we realized how damaging that decision was.  It will now take the most expensive restoration project ever concieved to attempt to bring the system anywhere close to its former self.  It is encouraging to see other countries taking such errors as cues to protect, and study marine environments before damaging decisions are made.

===message:In regard to "developed nations being on the leading edge of technology" if used in a smart way we can sometimes engineer around massive threats with really elegant new technology. The double hulled oil tankers for example are a very smart idea as long as we are going to be messing around with something as nasty as crude oil! Solid waste processing, high tech recycling, hydrogen fuel cells etc may also eventually save this planet and the coastal areas!
