===message:<p><b>You hit it right on the head of the nail when you wrote ...</B> "No one wants to give up their home and therefore despite ill fated suggestions they will try all in a futile attempt to save it". <P>This is also precisely the way we deal with coastal crises in the US. Tens of millions of dollars are spent on hardening beaches and protecting property that was built in a bad place. However, the owners raise so much hell and sue so the politicians usually go ahead and do all kinds of things to save the property.<p> I guess with Venice it is such an old and historically important city that they realistically could not just let 'er sink! Your comments are interesting ... there are many places that face very costly or even impossible rescue missions along the oceans of the world. <b> (When New Orlems starts really going under you and I are gonna have our taxes raised for that rescue for sure!)</b>
