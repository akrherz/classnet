I wrote the following in response to Kristi Foster's analysis- <p>

"The other issue is, of course, whether the solution will ultimately be futile since the flood gates may need to be closed so often (there is a new El Nin~o coming!) that the lagoon will become so totally polluted people will not visit and/or become ill from the sewage and effluent contamination!

Maybe cities (like people) were meant to die and vanish. Was there an Atlantis? Was it a sort of Venice-like city? Perhaps our effort to conserve, preserve and save everything is misguided, too expensive, and filled with hubris!? May marine archeologists think there might have been cities - for example between Cuba and the Yucatan peninsula - when that was a dry but low land bridge. So we are faced in Venice with an interesting conundrum, would you agree?"<p> 

I guess it is a battle between the desire by humans to control and conquer nature and the forces of wind, water, and tectonic plates to take their inevitable slow, sweet time and having their way. <b>Bye, bye Venice!</b> (and incidentally, bye bye Marshall Islands, and several other places too where there are not enough tourists, palaces, and thus, dollars to "save" them).
