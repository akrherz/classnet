===message:What a great way to discuss this - "... it reminded me of New Orleans." OF COURSE - you have a great analogy. <p>From the <b>Ocean's End</b> reading (remember that book!) we saw that many of the policies regarding digging of canals, "cancer alley", diversions of the river, dredging and straightening,and other bad ideas have made New orleans very vulnerable to flooding. <br>There is a theory that the City will indeed eventually vanish under the sea (since it is already way below sea level and the dyke system probably cannot hold up forever!<p. One of the key questions, of course, is can we afford to do <b>anything</b> to save the city? In the US we often said "yes, we are the richest country on earth". Today we may say maybe. The Third World (Bangladesh for example which sinks and floods more and more every year) cannot - they can't afford it!
