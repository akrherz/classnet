===message:<br>As you know, most of the natural and man-made 
environment has a time fuse on it - <b>nothing lasts 
forever! </b>Venice started, as with most communities, 
as a 
small place with few people and buildings that could be 
moved or chaeply replaced. Venice was successful. it 
grew. It expanded. It sank! and ... the sea rose. <p>
Now the question is how much longer it can (and 
should last). Forever is clearly not in the works! For 
anothern (x) years? Yes and at considerable cost.<p>
Your comment  "...but as most things already done to 
coatal (sic) areas and marine ecosystems, the harm 
has already been done" is interesting. Is all coastal 
activity harmful and bad? Or is that just life ... things 
change .. we live in a world where even nature herself 
often comes in and wipes out a lot of cool stuff? (think 
volcanoes, floods, fires, glaciers!). Enjoyed your 
comments.<br>
