is certainly THE most critically damaging human factor 
and it is the one I thought of first when I wrote this study 
question. I guess a few people with a lot of really deadly 
technology could, theoretically also do a lot of damage - 
the US and Industrial countries with relatively small 
populations do manage to put out a lot of bad stuff - 
CO2, CFC;s, oil-based pollutants, nuclear waste, etc. 

But, if there were 1 billion people instead of 6 on the 
planet that would sure help keep down the coastal 
problems!!
