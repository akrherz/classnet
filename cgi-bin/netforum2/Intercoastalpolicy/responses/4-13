===message:<br> You have a good observation when you write "maybe 
because many of the inhabitants still work the land as farmers, 
shepards, etc. there is a tie to the earth?" I believe that in many 
places "artesanal" occupations in the ocean and coast do make 
people aware of declining resources as they fish and harvest. I 
also wrote elsewhere that in developed countries we don't worry 
as we bulldoze ahead (literally) because we figger we can always 
find a technological fix (the Army Corps of Engineers!).
