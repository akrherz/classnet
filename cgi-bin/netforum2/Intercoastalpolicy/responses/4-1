===message:Your comments are very interesting but also sort of depressing!! There is an almost universal stress on the coastal environment and the need to have jobs, generate revenue and income, have a place to live seems to drive all coastal dwellers. In the assignment from the NOAA reading there is some interesting info about people from Developed-rich, middle, and developing/underdeveloped-poorer nations in how they view coastal policy needs and there is a difference in their views -- but as you suggest, there are some basic problems that characterize the stress on the coastal environment which necessitates behavioral changes regardless of whether it is in rich or poor communities.
