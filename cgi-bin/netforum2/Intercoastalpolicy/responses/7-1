===message:Well, after looking at other replies it appears that all my web-surfing has made me immune to propaganda. I guess I only looked for what I wanted, info on the conferences. I guess each website did have its own personal agenda but they all seemed to be working towards a similar goal..its like the Agenda 21 it has one goal but to achieve this goal it has to address different topics (thus soooo many chapters).

===message:<p>You seem to have a positive view of all the hype 
surrounding Joburg (which is fine!). There are a lot of 
"educational" sites. there are a lot of separate 
'agendas" by different groups and I would say that 
sometimes this is "politics". In other words, people with 
different solutions to problems trying to convince 
governments and people to do it "their way". <p> Did 
you also notice that many of the sites and links are 
selling something? Is that good, bad , or neutral?

===message:there is nothing wrong with many agendas. I just get 
confused when so many groups are all pushing their 
own solutions to so many problems. How are 
governments ever going to sort this all out and actually 
prioritize and make decisions?
