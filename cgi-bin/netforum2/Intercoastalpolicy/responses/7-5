===message:<p>It is true that there is lots of stuff out there on the 
Joburg agenda. Is that good or bad? Are we diluting 
and even commercializing development? Is this 
serious business or has it sort of degenerated into a 
hype event with everyone in it for their own 
organizational interests? Is this how we should be 
approaching the problem of saving the world? Will any 
of this really get nasty and evil governments to give their 
people more rights and thus lead to a better 
environment (and a better coastal zone)?<p>These are 
some serious questions and I have increasing doubts 
about whether these conferences really get 
governments to be better (and it is governments who 
have to move in the right direction).!  Good comments!
