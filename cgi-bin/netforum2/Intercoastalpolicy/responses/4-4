===message:Your comment is interesting that <b>"environmental costs of inappropriate economic development" </b>may be the reason environmental and economic reasons for ICZM are kind of blurred in the discussion (or the reason developing nations are talking somewhat more about environment than Economic reasons). The example of New Orleans is interesting - of course we can come up with lots of international examples of stupid use (in the long run) of coastal zones (the Black Sea, the Newfoundland fisheries are all examples).
