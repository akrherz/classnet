===message:I get your point (Surviver is a sucky show) about change on the island not being SO drastic anyway after the show. I also got a kick out of your comment<b> "So although it is tragic that his little house on the bay was destroyed I want to hear what he [the old man] has to say about his new situation now and whether or not he is really sad or misses his old house.</b><p>
The answer, I am confident, is that the old man and other islanders were very happy with: <br>(1)the excitement of the show coming to town. Little desolate islands are fun for cruisers and divers who live in big, exciting cities with great restaurants, good coffee houses, hot bars, nice stores, great T1 line hookups, complete digital wireless phone service, etc. but <b>for locals these little desolate places are sometimes painfully boring, and quiet abandonment!</b><br> (2) the new infrastructure left behind including computers and new structures. <br> (3)The publicity the place got which will probably bring some tourists and visitors.<br>
Of course, I can guarantee that it will also bring that rich American developer we encountered building golf courses on the reef in Belize! <b>So the islanders will need some ICZM experts (like our class!) to help them manage the new outside development without screwing up their entire island!</b>
