You said  "I am going to withhold any strong opinions" 
and then (thank God!) went on to express some mighty 
strong opinions!!<br>
I think that you reflect a widespread frustration at the 
notion that the US (which contributes by far the greatest 
dollar amount - not % of GNP - to international 
assistance is the culprit in all of the world's problems. I 
grew up and lived in Colombia and I can testify under 
oath that the Colombian elites and government were 
singlehandedly the culprit in Colombia's problems. 
<br>  You wrote "i was left a bit bitter"- indeed many 
people are bitter for the reasons you cite. the UN 
bureaucracy of imported wine and Brie cheese eaters 
from third world countries are often the last people who 
should be hrrumphing about the evil US! <b>Interesting 
and passionate comment!</b>
