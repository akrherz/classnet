===message:I see your point with your example in Monteverde, but my concern lies with the ticos' motives. What if the circumstances changed, and a developer paid a lot of money to develop this land? Without knowing the repercussions, the people involved might agree and encourage this. Also, what if trash pick-up became free of charge? 

I am sure you know a lot about this area, and I would like to know more about it, but what I noticed is that this is an eco-tourism area that was at least partly established by a Canadian non-profit group. My question is, do you think the eco-tourism reserve could have been established without outside help? What I mean is, do you believe the local community would have come to the same end results that they are at now? Because this area in particular had environmental reasons as their driving force. To establish an area as an ecotourism reserve, the motives are to conserve the natural resources and ecosystem. 

I agree with your comments about money. ("Money does affect people's behavior and we should use that as a tool to accomplish environmental protection that may not otherwise happen.") This is a good idea.

===message:Actually, Michelle, I think that the original founders of Monteverde were a group of Quakers that were escaping the draft here in the US.  Although they may not have been striving for an environmental utopia, they did understand basic ecological principles and left the forests that graced the hilltops in order to protect the watershed, and therefore the water supply.  I agree with your concern over the motivation of the modern Ticos, but I would have to go with the idea that something is better than nothing.  Use stop-gaps like these for immediete benefits, and then come in and work on the slow process of environmental education, capacity-building, and awareness.

===message:What I meant to point out is that I think the motives do matter. I think the Quaker group that founded Monteverde had the right motives. And I also do not believe that a group of people, or a particular individual that does not have the right motives will end up with an outcome such as this. I think the motives behind an outcome such as this have always had to have conservation of the environment and its natural resources as one of the primary concerns.

===message:Hi Michelle,  Don't get me wrong, I do agree with what you are saying, at least in the long run.  I do think that an awareness needs to be built so that people follow sustainable practices willingly.  However, the process of educating, and even more difficult - making people care, is a long, slow process.  Sometimes situations need immediete action for which the local motivation does not exist.  In Florida, for example, people generally understand and support the reasons for limited lobster seasons, size limits, and licensing.  However, without penalties for disobeying these regulations, a lot of people, including those that "care" would probably lack the "motivation" to voluntarily conserve this resource.  Additionally, despite the degree to which Americans care about clean highways, we still have $500 littering fines keeping us in line...  On the flip side, I completely see your point on the danger of the introduction of non-sustainable industry with greater financial advantages - if the passion is not there, the people will abandon it for apparent financial gain.  Ideally, it would be great if economic incentives could be found for all sustainable practices - tax benefits if you recycle or leave forest uncleared, etc...  There are a couple of now famous examples of national debt for nature swaps, but other than those, these incentives are often hard to put into reality.

===message:<br>I liked your comment - "They recycle because it costs too 
much money to pay for their trash to be picked up. Although their 
reasons may not be as noble as we would like, they are getting the 
job done". Sometimes reverse logic (or conditions) bring about 
good results. It is an irony. In Colombia every piece of paper, every 
bottle, every tin can was "recycled" by "trash pickers" who came by 
once a week ahead of the garbage truck. Then they also picked 
over the huge garbage landfill where the remaining stuff was 
dumped. That's recycling! But, on the other hand, once the 
population density in an area gets too great they also strip every 
tree and bush, mangrove, etc. to build and cook with so there are 
fascinating dynamics at work all the time.
