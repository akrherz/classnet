===message:<P>Wow! You certainly covered a  lot of cool ground 
with your comments! I was also surprised at the 
"carnival" or "bazaar" atmosphere which is now 
surrounding these types of massive globa; meetings. I 
have not decided if this is all good or just confusing. I 
mean, how is anyone going to make heads or tails of 
all this?!<br> You pointed out that each group is trying 
to "...sell each agenda to the public before the event." 
Are there any selfish or even wrongheaded agendas 
being sold? I think so. Are there many government 
leaders from most nations who will really pay any 
attention to all this? <b>I don't think so! </b> <p> I think 
most governments will do the best they can within the 
constraints and pressures to which they are subject 
from internal presure groups. Some of the NGO's are 
effective but others are just annoying and irrelevant tgo 
many governments (Do you think Saddam Hussein or 
the government of Moldova will pay much attention to 
Greeenpeace!??) NNOOOT!!!<br>
Good comments!
