===message:What would be a sound ICZM policy for this island? No 
development; some development; full development? 
Does it depend what the govt and people need ... jobs, 
tax revenue, pristine environment, ... the matrix of 
decision is so complicated but one think is clear. There 
needs to be research and a field study by our entire 
class of this Marquesas venue so we can give our ICZM 
advice to the locals and the govt!
