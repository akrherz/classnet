===message:<br> I think you have a good point- lack of education - is a huge problem as people interact with the coastal and ocean zones. However, it is a problem even in the US and highly "educated" countries because people are selfish and short sighted and often want it all NOW! I have seen nice, pleasant, quiet, great places decide they need to grow and develop and wreck what they had without anything really "improving". How can you educate poor fundamental choices? In many places they'd rather have a negative impact on the coastal zone and get the extra income or whatever. (see Ft Lauderdale by the Sea, some of the islands where I sail every year - Bequia, Mayreau, Carriacou.)

===message:People are most inspired to change when it affects their wallet. I think that the people in more "educated" areas of the world must be forced to abide by coastal zone management laws by incredible fines!! People start to listen when it costs!! Many coastal zone development plans include fines for destroying mangroves, etc. It is still way more profitable for them to build in these areas because of the demand. These fines need to be increased to make them change their practices.
