===message:<br> I saw a huge sea turtle in the back of a grimy pickup truck at the fish market in Nassau. Endangered!? not when you can make big bucks from a dead turtle! I don't think most third world countries have very much effective envirionmental education program for the masses. This, plus some serious efforts at alternative income for people who now kill sharks and turtles is crucial and hurry up! Time is short!
