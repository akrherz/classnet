===message:I think you have a pragmatic view of all this stuff- maybe 
if there is some money to be made and commercial 
interest in sustainable conferences they will be better 
funded and successful! <br> You wrote "Could that 
Du-Pont money be trickling down from plastics 
research/factories?" when refering to U of Delaware 
and the answer is - Yes they are very well funded and 
entrepreneurial! I think Nova and our Oceanographic 
Center could be (and in the future will be) more that way 
too - pushy, trying to build on our strengths and 
expertise, selling services and knowledge more 
aggressively. I see nothing wrong wsith that!!
