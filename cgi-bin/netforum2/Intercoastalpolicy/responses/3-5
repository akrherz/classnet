===message:Your example is excellent and does in fact raise the nightmarish issue of multiple jurisdictions both agency (horizontal) and at different jurisdictional levels (vertical). You basically end of with a matrix that looks like a freakin' checker board of all the steps that have to be followed.!! In other countries there may be similar problems in some (Germany) but in others the problem is that if the President decides to order something it is done regardless of the negative impact, costs etc. So both extremes can be nasty! I don't think I'll still be in this business for you to "keep me posted" from the looks of how long this is taking!
