===message:You are right that enviro and econ are <b>BOTH</b>important ... but for the sake of an interesting discussion I chose the - to me - somewhat surprising results from the Sain-Sain international survey. I would have guessed that Econ reasons would be more important in Developing (poor) nations. Gregg had some interesting comments on the possible semantic confusion in doing the survey where econ and enviro actually mean the same thing in some sense.<p>
I like your argument "do it right the first time" by focusing on environment and avoiding unnecessary duplication. It makes sense to me and it also reflects the new (current)concerns in "donor nations" with global warming and econlogy (which were not as visible when the developing countries started implementing Coastal Managemnt policies). So <b>timing (when something starts happening) </b>is a factor in how a policy agenda may be cast.
