===message:Your discussion is great in the sense that we may be missing research and discussion on the "marketing" ICZM which is probably quite a bit different from Coastal Policy "education". I suppose that if education were done more effectively and with real integrated strategy (and a bigger budget!) it would start looking like a real product or service marketing campaign. <p>

I think that people in developing nations would respond as well or better to duscussions about the commercial (and income or economic) value of their coastal areas as folks in the Developed or intermediate countries. <p>

Actually, I'm sure some governments and certainly some of the NGO's (Greenpeace etc) use ad agencies for their environmental campaigns. Go to http://environmentaldirectory.net/search.htm  for a search engine that lists a huge number of environmental groups and I'll bet Audubon and some of the other's actually contract out for marketing campaigns.
