===message:Very good point! It's unfortunate that this is the reality we live in and that the people who recognize people's displaced priorities and distorted views of what will solve all the world's problems seem to be in the minority.  But how exactly do we facilitate more awareness of these facts in order to implement feasable and practical policies and laws?

===message:I agree with you for the most part but, not every culture is concentrating 100% on mass destruction and personal gain. There are some underdeveloped countries that have not been educated or even understand what types of losses they are contributing to because of the poverty they live in. 
If it were possible to hold those responsible that cause environmental destruction accountable, what could we penalize them with? I have come to some of the same conculsions as you concerning enforcable laws and my question is, how? Because it's obviously not working or maybe there just aren't enough laws.

===message:<br> These comments are all really interesting. I am struck that we lament the lack of governemnt to regulate this, the lack of government money and funding to enforce programs, etc. If govts. are slow or indifferent are there any non-government strategies and non-government funding sources taht could be mobilized.<br>
Any ideas here? There are some cool models we should talk about.

===message:Dr. Schmidt,

I am glad that you mentioned this, because I believe that relying on the government for all ICZM (or any other issue), can be a big mistake.  Governments tend to become too big, resulting in rampant beaurocracy and waste.  I spent all last year working for the U.S. National Park Service, considered the best of its kind on the planet, and yet I was appalled by the way that budgets and spending are approached.  The government takes the exact oppossite approach of business and NGOS - they have to spend as much as possible, on anything, within a given budget, or they have it taken away at the end of the fiscal year.  In the meantime, many fantastic projects and innovative ideas are left unfunded due to a lack of economic resources (in reality, resources wasted by managers that feared having their budgets taken away if they did not spend it all).  Many of our ICZM issues can and should be handled by the private sector.  The private sector is generally the first to feel or become aware of the impacts of coastal mismanagement and is generally the first voice to speak out when a problem arises.  In Ecuador, for example, it was local communities and grass-root NGOS that brought the issue of aquaculture-based mangrove destruction to the world's attention.  Despite the fact that the Ecuadorian government spends a lot of money on regular GIS-based coastal monitoring, it was only the private sector's voice that was heard.  Additionally, Ecuador now boasts one of the best models for an ICZM program in Latin America. Despite the fact that this IS a government program, it was entirely designed by the private sector (U.S. based universities) and funded by multilaterals (IDB, World Bank, as well as USAID).  Furthermore, the biggest changes in Ecuadorian coastal management are arguably coming from the aquaculture industry itself.  Loss of production through poor managment practices and increased international protest against these practices, have resulted in many internal changes within the industry and a new trend, independent of government regulation, to pursue sustainable practices.
