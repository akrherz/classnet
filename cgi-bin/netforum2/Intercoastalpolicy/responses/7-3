===message:Nice breakdown of the main players in this mega event. 
you are right ... this type of conference has become a 
sort of Oscar Academy Awards of development and 
environmentalism. I don't know if I like that or feel it is 
effective or if I'm disturbed and conclude that these 
meetings have become big PR MegaEvents which don't 
really get to the problems of governments needing to 
design smart CZM and sustainable development 
strategies. <p> You wrote that many have "... created a 
new industry for ICZM consultants." I guess there is 
nothing wrong with that if we can get some successful 
ICZM  put in place.
