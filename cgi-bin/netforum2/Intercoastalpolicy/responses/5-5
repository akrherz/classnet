===message:Your comments are interesting and I sense some 
irritation at being required to read and then comment 
on a pop culture source such as sailing and crising 
magazines. THAT IS THE POINT OF MY 
ASSIGNMNENT so good job. Most people see coastal 
zones from a <b>very</b> narrow "entertainment" or at 
best "infotainment" perspective. 
<br>There fore, I think it's instructive to read and 
<b>"deconstruct"</b> (i.e. analyze by component) the 
biases and shortfalls of this popular view of islands, 
oceans, and beaches. This is not coastal Anthropology 
(which, by the way, is a new field of study). <br>But, I 
hope we can see from this case that the commercial 
view of islands is much the same for Holywood 
producers or condo builders. You bring in a bulldozer to 
improve on nature! <br> Moreover, local people on 
islands may actually like some of the action attention 
and "goodies" that the outsiders bring in! <b>Think 
about it!</b>
