===message:<br> Thanks for your interesting and deservedly upbeat posting regarding TIDE (Toledo Institute for Development and Environment)in Belize. Maybe we are all (including mE!!) too pessimistic or (like the newsmadia) attracted to the sensationalist and terrible. Maybe we need to put a discussion topic in this class that says "Post one really positive, upbeat, and successful story about IICZM".<br>
