===message:Your comments are useful and I suppose that often environmental and econmic issues kind of get blurred together. It just seemed weird to me (and in the past has seemed inverted to my classes) that in the Sain-Sain international survey mentioned in the assigned (NOAA)reading the developing countries mantion the <b>environment</b> more often as a reason for ICZM than developed nations.<p>
In the case of Georgia and other nations an ICZM plan can do a lot of good. However, you'll agree that a more regional approach to ICZM (including all upstream and "in-transit" (eg. ships passing through)is the only long-term way to get a grip on this nasty problem. and, by-the-way, the Black Sea is a perfect example of the inexorable connection between economics and environment when it comes to ICZM since they have virtually wiped out (for the time being) several economically important sources of jobs and income by NOT having had coastal stewardship programs.
