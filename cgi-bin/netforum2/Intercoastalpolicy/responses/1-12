===message:<br> Arlo. You wrote that the most important (or META) problem is "human population growth in coastal areas and the increasing pattern, especially in developed nations, of excessive over-consumption"<br>
I think you are right that there are too many of us. The whole world wants to live better so the demand for a higher standard of living is universal. <br>
Is it possible that we could jump over the negatives of consumption with newer and higher tech systems? I ask because often the low tech (wood burning stoves and ovens, single hull oil tankers, inadequate sewage disposal and treatment)cause the big problmes.<br>
Of course, there has to be an awareness of and effort to respect nature and live side by side with her.

===message:Dr. Schmidt,

I agree that advances in technology will help the situation, but unless we can curb exponential growth, this will only be a buffer.  I too thought of this and mentioned it in my first response (advances in aquaculture, etc.).  The fact is that we are given a finite amount of resources on this planet and although the ocean once seemed inexhaustable, we have come to learn that there are limits to what we can take and still expect to have replenished.

===message: <br> As you say, "over-consumption" is a big problem. But I grew up in Cali, Colombia and, as a kid, there was under-consumption but by too many people! They were like locusts who stripped the hills clear of all trees and vegetation, causing massive erosion, runoff into the Cauca river, and other disasters just because there were so many. (China has had the same problem with low consumption but huge population - downriver in Bangladesh the problem becomes huge). <br> Maybe a recession or depression will reduce consumption but ... I think you agree <b>most of the world is striving to "catch up" withn the US and Europe. That is the model!!</b>
