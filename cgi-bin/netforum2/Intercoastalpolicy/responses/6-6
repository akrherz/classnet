===message:Wow this is an interesting set of comments. Obviosuly, Venice was built in a delicate coastal area and it's growth over the centuries was done in utter ignorance of the consequences of many of the actions in and around the area which would ultimately doom the city. So, one lesson it seems to me is that the "available science" at any given time is pretty rotten (since it often is not complex enough to know what will happen 100 or 800 years later as a consequence).<p> The other issue is, of course, whether the solution will ultimately be futile since the flood gates may need to be closed so often (there is a new El Nin~o coming!) that the lagoon will become so totally polluted people will not visit and/or become ill from the sewage and effluent contamination!<p> Maybe cities (like people) were meant to die and vanish. Was there an Atlantis? Was it a sort of Venice-like city? Perhaps our effort to conserve, preserve and save everything is misguided, too expensive, and filled with hubris!? May marine archeologists think there might have been cities - for example between Cuba and the Yucatan peninsula - when that was a dry but low land bridge. So we are faced in Venice with an interesting conundrum, would you agree?

===message:Of course the least expensive (monetarily speaking, not culturally or historically), is to let nature take its course.  Society has enough forewarning to save the important works of art and historical records.  Television crews and photographers can document the sinking of Venice.  Then when technology catches up, we can celebrate with The Raising of Venice.  Until then, Italy can boast a new dive destination.
