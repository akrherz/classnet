===message:Delays in projects are indeed often very costly. Of course, other times they allow more study and you can - as Krazy Ross Perot used to say - "Measure twice- cut once." i.e. you avoid having to fix stuff if you wait and get it right the first time.<p> However, with Venice it seems to me that all the options are bad. They are all <b>very</b> expensive and they have lots of negative side effects. The real problem is that when you build right by the sea it is eventually gonna want to come and reclaim land. And, if you ask me, the sea still has more force, persistance, and power (in the long run) than most things we can throw at it! <p> If the sea level rises a couple of feet (one of the predictions from the UN Global Warming folks), then things will get really interesting in Venice! I saw an article that the Dutch, who have claimed and dried out a lot of land with their dykes, are now planning for a three foot rise in sea levels over the next 30-50 years!! And they really know their "rising seas" stuff!<p> PS. I don't now where all the lost messages and postings go on the Internet - if you find them please have all of my lost stuff sent back too!
