===message:Very interesting comments. I won't ask how you came 
to spend time at Vieques since it is not a common 
tourism venue. Maybe development will not happen 
since the place is mostly dangerous and littered with 
unexploded ordinance! (maybe we should slow down 
the cleanup so that developers willNOT be interested or 
able to build resorts there. Of course, when the island 
initially 
became a training site for amphibious operations for 
the US navy many years ago it was just seen as some 
remote and almost 
uninhabited rock! (Like Bikini Atoll where nuclear 
testing took place). Our concern now shows that we are 
in a new era - (1) we think people should control more 
of their local 
community AND (2) the environment IS important. So 
how 
Vieques evolves will indeed be interesting to watch. I 
saw in the New York Times that training activities will 
now be shifted somewhere else.

===message:No harm in asking why i was there.  My parents own a small piece of land where my mother wanted to start a grass-roots community based organic vegetable farm.  That won't be happening, but they still spend a good deal of time there and my father is one of the more popular gringos on the island (for example, he is there right now for a month and a half.....living in the barrio.  That is pretty unusual, especially when you see that he NEVER gets harrassed).  I knew that the SEALs used it a practice site since the fifties, and we actually saw some of there exercises there about ten years ago.  Several ex-SEALs live on the island now, running dive charters.

===message:Your relationship with Vieques is interesting. Thanks. 
Latin American love Americans and the US they just 
don't like to be jerked around and taken advantage of by 
corporations, the US govt. etc. It would be really cool if 
you'd do an internship project sometime with a group 
on Vieques restoration and remediation. That would 
certainly have world-wide applicability since this is quite 
a problem in lots of places. There are many places 
where stuff needs to be restored - I have a case study 
of Nauru that I'm gonna have you all look at. Even more 
tragic than Vieques!
