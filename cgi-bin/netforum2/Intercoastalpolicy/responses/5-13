===message:I forgot to say earlier...<u>Cruising World</u> says that Daniel's property was owned by the French Polynesian government.  I read in a magazine called <u>Latitude</u> that the land was actually part of large area of farmland owned by a relative of Daniel's (his brother, I think).  The letter in the magazine also says that the owner of the land was supposed to be compensated for use of the beach, but was paid less than promised by CBS. He also claimed that CBS had not replaced all the structures that were promised.  This was written in June 2002, so I don't know how much is true, or if any disputes have been settled.
