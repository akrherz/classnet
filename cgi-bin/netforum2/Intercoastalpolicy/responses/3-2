===message:This is a great example where non-coastal (and 
indirect) acivity (miles from the coast) causes a great 
deal of coastal contamination. Normally we think of 
land-based, upstream, contamination (as in Black Sea, 
and the Dead Zone in the Gulf of Mexico discussed in 
Ocean's End). I have seen the same on the south 
shore of Bonaire where garbage from Venezuela, from 
ships, and cruise ships too washes ashore. The place 
is feet deep in plastics, bottles, and anything else that 
can float. Solution: (1) regulate dumping and fine, (2) 
establish a regular, routine and efficint beach cleanup 
operation to remove the trash. Good issue!
