===message:<br> Your logic is really interesting and complicated (and I was 
actually able to follow the reasoning!). I find it interesting that the 
concept of IICZM has actually penetrated to most places in the 
world in some form or another. That's good news anyway even if 
the resources available to implement environmental, planning and 
ICZM policy are pitiful even in the US. The worry I have is that 
managing coastal areas smartly requires lots of money. In several 
places I've been (St Lucia for example) marine protected areas 
have bee established and the rangers and upkeep is financed by 
charging mooring fees for boats that come to visit. So, generating 
income <b> directly</b> for environmental and CZM projects is 
something we need to seriously explore and develop. In fact, I can 
think of almost nothing that would be more beneficial for IICZM 
than to devise low impact, steady, predictable income generating 
economic development - it would make a huge difference.
