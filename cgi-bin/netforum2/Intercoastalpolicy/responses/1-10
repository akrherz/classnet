===message:I remember spending a month with my parents at the 
Costa Brava in Spain many years ago. This wonderful 
Spanish coastal area was coming under a lot of 
pressure from the newly-affluent German tourists ("with 
big camers and wearing shorts" as a waiter told my 
mother!). Large hotels and a whole host of concrete 
structures such as big parking lots for the tour buses, 
which were the most popular transporatation, were 
being built. It is true that a significant source of 
pressure on coastal zones comes from the 
development of tourism.
