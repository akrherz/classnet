===message:Education seems to be an overlying theme in all of our discussions.  Not enough time or money is spent in environmental education. If we are to going to reduce overpopulation, enforce environmental regulations, change our daily practices, and curb ignorance we must invest in education!!

===message:<br> Interesting and fairly depressign to me! " human nature" is so 
much bigger than education, or coastal regulations! <br>
So the reality is that people have been building on, overfishing, 
dumping in the ocean since the start of human beings! <b>Have 
we (humans) always been </b>characterized by  "ignorance, 
carelessness, impatience, and lack of understanding of our 
surroundings, not to mention humans' extreme superiority 
complex"?<br>
It is so hard for people to see beyond hunger, pleasure and self-
gratification (the beach, beachfront living), sport (fishing), 
superstition (in Asia people eat rate and endangered marine and 
coastal species to imporve their sex drive!).<br>
Which of these human drives can we re-shape?

===message:In response to whether human nature has always been so unattached to our environment, I will have to answer no.  I believe that something about modern society is ripping us away from a natural connection that we have always had.  I also do not feel that this is cut and dry, but a slow process.  Today's world, with cell phones, x-boxes, palm pilots, MTV, and DVD systems in our SUVs creates a much greater separation than that of even the early industrial revolution here in America.  The more we create, the less we understand.  I just recently had the amazing priveledge to visit several Huaorani indigenous communities of the Ecuadorian Amazon.  The communities that lived deep within the forest still practice all of their traditions that have been passed on for millenia.  The children are eagerly learning and accepting these traditions and there is an atmosphere of hope within the community.  These traditions are deep-rooted in an understanding of how the local environment works.  No one hunts or fishes if all stomachs are full, no one kills an animal that is too big to eat before it wastes, no one kills for sport alone - there is always a need behind a killing.  However, as you get closer to the main oil roads that now scar the Amazonian landscape, the communities in these areas are different.  Regularly influenced by colonists and western products, the children in these communities have no interest in Huaorani traditions.  Missionaries and access to firearms have changed hunting patterns and there is very little game left.  The future of these communities is very, very bleak.  As you can see, it is all a gradient, nothing is cut and dry.
