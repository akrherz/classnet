===message:<br> This was a great discussion about Nuku Hiva because it 
represents the frustration we all feel about these issues! <br> You 
said neither point of view - of Daniel or of the other local people is 
'the truth". Maybe! Or maybe <b>both</b> are the truth! <br>The 
pull and push of globalization, of change that is sweeping around 
all the time. <br> People really do not have control of their destiny, 
now, and probably not before in history either! There was always a 
group over the mountain or across the ocean who would "come 
over" and change everything. It's kind frustrating but it does no 
good to start from the premise that if it were not for capitalists all 
would be swell<br> The Inca and Aztec empires were very 
expansionist. The Ottoman Empire ended up at the gates of 
Vienna. The Roman Empire reaches to England and North Africa, 
The Islamic expansion in Africa was vast. So let's please recognize 
how few people on Earth have escaped the Nuku Hiva 
phenomenon. In the past Daniel and his neighbors would have 
ended up as slaves or servants of the cruisers and the reality show 
crew!
