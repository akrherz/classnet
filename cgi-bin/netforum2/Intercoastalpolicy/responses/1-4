===message:When you say the problem is the "predominance of 
ecological ignorance and environmental indifference in 
the vast majority of the nations on this planet" you are 
on to something important. Even in the US until recently 
there was not much good science on the coastal 
ecosystem and on the specific consequences of 
human action. In many countries traditional practices 
and behavior (which had less damaging impact 
because of lower technology for exploitation, fewer 
people, and more robust ecosystem) are still practiced 
even though NOW the consequences of the actions are 
very devastating. But, even now with more info and even 
in the US we are still over stressing coastal areas 
because of indifference and greed.
