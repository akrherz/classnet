===message:Your point about a lack of education is great but in 
some cases it has also been overall ignorance as to 
the consequences of actions. When you could literally 
walk across water on the backs of turtles because 
there were so many of them (Dry Tortugas for example) 
it  just simply did not ocurr to peopl that these could 
ever become extinct. (same for Cod). Now that we have 
more information  good education (and good laws) are 
very important. In much of the world that education is 
still missing!
