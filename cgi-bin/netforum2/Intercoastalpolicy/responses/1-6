===message:You have an important point - money and cost can be a 
sobering and compelling factor in making people think. 
The damage to, pressure on, and growing costs of 
activities in coastal areas becomes "real" when costs 
(water, sewage, etc.) become big and prohibitive. 
Unfortunately that is a retroactive (i.e. post hoc) learning 
process. What we as International Coastal zone policy 
experts need to do is figger out how to make it clear to 
communities and governments BEFORE THE DAMAGE 
IS DONE that the costs may outweigh the benefits. That 
would be real progress!
