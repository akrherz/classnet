===message:Your comment that the Third World nations have "...seen the errors of our (1st world/developed countries)ways." is EXCELLENT! There is a big advantage to being a Third World country <b>if</b> you can avoid the mistakes made by others. However, I'd like to see if this environmental awareness in developing nations is only among the Elites or if it also gets down to the coastal village and town level (and to the level of individual fishermen).
