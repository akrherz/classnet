===message:You have an interesting perspective in looking at this from the angle of the magazine editors. Your comment that "...neither editor wondered about the destruction and long term concerns below the waves. Maybe we should ask the editors of SCUBA or Skindiving Magazines for a follow-up." is very good! <br>
I think that even those of us who dive need local infrastructure (dive shops, fuel, supplies, divemasters, air and compressors, booze(!), etc.). As you know, in many places (especially Florida) there is real concern about dive shop, scuba, and snorkling impact on reefs 9or Manatees and other marine mammals etc).<br>
So we are caught in the dillema of whether we want remote and "unspoiled" places to stay that way (keep out people and keep out development) or whether (as some of our classmates in this course argue) allowing local people some of the fruits of modern, consumer society.<br>
My own sense is that, as I said in other comments on this discussion thread, we, as ICZM "experts" can best serve as guides to help local communities, coastal groups, and islands to make the modernization benign - minimize the damage to the environment while still changing. <b>That's not a bad professional mission for us is it ?!!</b>

===message:No its not a bad mission statement, but I wonder after reading all the web links " on the Road " to 2002, what an ICZM expert is.  Internationally we have certainly had plenty of meetings about the environment.  I have been involved with over six UN Peace Keeping exercises as well as humanitarian relief organizations including NGO's and international defense and economic ministries.  I have learned that if there is not an enforcement or measurable goals set, then it is nearly impossible to build on or to define a "success".  Should ICZM remain in the academic and government areans as resource experts or should we remain in the business worldactively benefitting from our case studies and personal experience.  If so why aren"t there more US educational institutions involved with Johnesburg 2002?

===message:Your response is VERY interesting. <br>I think Joburg is being vastly overshadowed by terrorism and the new global agenda in which sustainability, the environemnt, long range future planning, has been relegated to a much lower profile. I think many people are "burned out" after Rio, Kyoto, and all the other global conferences. And, the media is not covering these events as it was before and I doubt that Joburg will get more than passing attention.<br> However, this is still an opportunity for those of us in the policy (and policy/ envrionmental sciences) area to have a huge impact. The smart management of valuable, dwindling resources is very important in helping people achieve prosperity and good health which all people would like. <br>If we work hard, albeit somewhat under the radar screen, with business, governments, NGO's, local communities, etc. I think we can make a big difference in the next 20 years. I guess I'm an optimist today! <br>And yes, there have to be "deliverables", measurable benchmarks, and good rules that are actually enforced. That's why good government is a big part of all this.
