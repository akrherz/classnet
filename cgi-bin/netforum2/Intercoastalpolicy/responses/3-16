===message:I'm not sure about Virgina or if it's a national policy, by Illinois has a law that if you develop on an environmentally sensitive wetland, than you must 'build' and protect a similar area, somewhere else. To the innocent ear this sounds great, build on one, save another.  But, as far as I know, nobody has been able to duplicate nature.  Further more, many of these habitats are bird migrating area and the birds I'm sure were not told of their newly built 'home'.  The law is a basic loophole for development.
I'm wondering if Virginia has the same laws? Furthermore, if those new homeowners know that their homes are built on soft marsh soil?

===message:<br> Your story is very touching and it is so representative of what's happening everywhere. This is a great example of where a coastal land trust could have come in and bought the land from the guy (thus giving him the income he wanted). The land could become a visitor center, study park, preserve, educational center. In these times this is a neat way to do preserve lands like this... but you are right, we are a greedy species (not just in the USA!).
