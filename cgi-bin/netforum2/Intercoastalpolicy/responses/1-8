===message:You have an excellent point  when you say that "people 
act without taking into consideration the consequences 
of their actions". (This is now also perhaps called 
GREED). That is true of governments, corporations, 
and most individuals. Perhaps it is wired into people (in 
our DNA) from the hunting and gathering times when 
few people and inexhaustible resources put a premium 
on harvesting and not on conserving.
