===message:I found your comments interesting, and I like that you stated your reasons for agreement with the current "management" plan. You said that current ORV access is "not controlled by an official ORV Management Plan as required for all National Parks." My question is, if this is required, do you know if they are currently in the process of implementing an official ORV Management Plan? And if not, have there been any steps taken to install one, possibly by the environmental groups that are in opposition of ORV access? My second question is, would you also agree with the same type of "management" plan under similar circumstances, except in an area that does not currently allow ORV access? If not, could you explain why? I find this topic of particular interest. Thanks--

===message:<p>In answer to Michelle's questions:</p>
<p>Some history about this area would probably be helpful to begin with.  Until public roads were built on Hatteras Island (approx 1952) the only forms of transportation available were ORV's.  Cape Hatteras National Seashore was dedicated in 1953 and no plans were implemented at the time to ban or restrict access to ORV's other than creating ingress and egress points to minimize dune destruction.  I think that Federal ORV Management Plans began to be required in 1977 or so.  Apparently there was a draft sent to the proper authorities sometime shortly after that.  No final plan was ever completed. </p>
That being said, the Cape Hatteras National Seashore has faced other well-known problems since the early 80's that may have taken priority over the ORV plan.  Or it could have slipped through the cracks.  Other pressing issues have included the severe erosion threatening the Hatteras Lighthouse and the subsequent relocation along with some conflict with the Army COE over dredging in the Oregon Inlet which is adjacent to NPS land.</p>
<p>A lawsuit has been brought against the NPS for failing to comply with the executive orders that require an official ORV Management Plan.  I couldn't find any data from the NPS website as to when a plan will be finalized, but it did note that it could take 2 yesrs plus time for public meetings and any additional studies required.  </p>
<p>On to your final question:  Would I agree with similar management techniques on other beaches that do not currently allow ORV access.  I'm assuming you mean the idea of restricting access to defined and carefully supervised areas as opposed to the public possibly using the beaches irresponsibly elsewhere.  Great question!  Well, it's a tough issue to address.  I feel that the recent "historical" use of the Outer Banks makes this a unique case.  There are actually still many areas there that have no "roads" except marked sand.  Ecologically, the best thing would be to ban ORV access in Hatteras, but in balancing human wants with environmental needs, I think a decent compromise has been reached.In other areas where ORV access has either successfully been banned or where ORV access has not occurred in recent times, I think that it should not be reintroduced unless problems with illegal entry and destruction could be "fixed" with allowing public ORV access to a regulated area.  I know that sounds wishy washy.  Basically, if people are determined to get into National Parks, it's better to have them in a supervised and regulated, but legal ORV area, then to have them entering illegally and probably acting irresponsibly.  </p>Let me know if you have any more questions.  I have a fair amount of info on the Hatteras case.  Not so much for other parks, though.

===message:Thanks for all the explanations and answers. This just reiterates to me how difficult it is to make blanket decisions in management, because so many issues need to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. It sounds so nice there, and I hope an effective management plan can be established, and is one that allows you to still enjoy ORV access!

===message:<br> It sounds dumb but there could be a series of ORV trails that are natural, look offroad, are exciting, take people to places where they want to go to fish, hunt, hang out etc but that are designed to control negative impact?<br> I agree with you that banning things sometimes causes the "toothpaste" effect - you squuez in one place (restructions) and the pase (ORV) will squish somewhere elese and often to a place that is very congested then and thus causes more damage! <br> Interesting example!
