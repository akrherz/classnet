===message:I love this example! One person who is committed and 
loves the environment can make a huge difference. 
This is so NOT what I have seen in Colombia, Costa 
Rica, Guatemala, and last month in Rome where trash 
is seen as something decorative to be thrown on the 
streets, parks, school grounds, rivers. It is treated as 
"someone elses problem" and people do not even 
seem to see the trash much less care about what 
plastic translucent bags do to sea turtles (who love to 
eat jellyfish and these bags floating in the ocean look 
just like a tasty meal!). <br>
Education can, 
as you demonstrate, make a huge difference! This little 
example should be in the Bequia advertisements for 
visitors to come (and wt the airport or harbor a short 
message from this man should be played for every 
visitor!).
