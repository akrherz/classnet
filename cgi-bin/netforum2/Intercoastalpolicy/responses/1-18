===message:I agree completely about the funding needs. Take Belize for example. If you look at a map of it, land and water, you would be amazed at the amount of reserves, preserves, sanctuaries, etc.  But in reality, most of these areas receive little funding and are sometimes managed by only 1-2 people. Logging, poaching, and over-fishing are regularly occurring, due to lack of funding.

===message:<br> Great comments! Like so much of what's going on in the world today there is a lack of international law and governance of the oceans (and the coastal areas they touch which is one and the same) and where there <b>is</b> law there is no will power and no police enforcement globally. It's the same as the problems with human rights, weapons of mass destruction, genocide, women's rights, etc.

===message:<br>Good point! I grew up and lived in Colombia where nothing is enforced and where the govt. doesn't even control 3/4 of the country everything becomes theoretical! To that extent it is partially funding but it is also, in many places, local and national culture... In many ways I am often discouraged about the <b> desire</b> of local governments and elites to strongly enforce these laws.
