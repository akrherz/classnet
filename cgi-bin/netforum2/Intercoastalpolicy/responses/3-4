===message:The three vignettes you wrote are excellent and make the point so clearly and passionately. Underdevelopment is NOT better than overdevelopment (the US) because poor people wreck nature as much as anyone (or more). The other problem is that government, regulation, and law in developing (newly emerging - a euphamism often as with Haiti!), countries is also NOT DEVELOPED! We find out very quickly that a good life and clean environment and smart (sustainable) policy can ONLY come from government. It is a necessary partner and often the leader in making things work right. Great narratives!
