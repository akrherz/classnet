===message:Your points are well taken. When you wrote <b>" ..perhaps this minority was simply responsible for retarding the evolution of the island's culture and this "attack" was inevitable"</b> you also imply that there may not be such aversion to modernization on the part of the majority of people in places such as Nuku Hiva. <p>
I would not be so pessimistic as to say "..island cultures could slowly move into contact with the modern world and only assimilate those qualities that are benign. That, obviously will never happen." I believe that it is the duty and challenge of those of us working on ICZM to help local communities "ease" into new conditions in a sound way, minimizing the negative impact of change. But you are right - who are we , or the yacht owners, to "hold back" the way of life of local people?
