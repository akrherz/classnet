===message:Lack of compromise is certainly one big problem. And a wider range of participants in the decisions over the past 100 years might have produced a sort of "early" ICZM. I think that prevention is more reasonable cost wise and is so rarely evident in these kinds of problems.<br> Of course bad or weak science and poor ability to predict the future also have a major impact in all of this.<br> By the way I really loved your comments "Everglades and the Kissimmee River are other examples of this. All the effort and money being put into the Everglades is trying to reverse the effects of the canal system built almost a half century ago to fix water problems. The Kissimmee River" <br>These comments show a real comparative and analytical thinking! Nice job!
