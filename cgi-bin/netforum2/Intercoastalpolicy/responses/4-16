===message:I had to read this really interesting book called <u>Ishmael</u> for an environmental law class.  It's now one of my favorites.  Anyway, there is a theory in this book that the world has two types of people - the leavers and the takers.  The leavers are usually tribal, "primitive" people who do not understand taking more than they need.  The takers are "civilized" peoples who use up resources at an impressive rate.  While people in developing countries may not be "primitive", perhaps they still understand that to survive in the animal kingdom you should only take what you need so that others may also use the resource. I think that taker ("civilized") man, in many cases, took the whole "dominion over the earth" thing a little incorrectly, changing the goal to domination.

===message:Hey Christian,

I agree with what you are saying here and it goes back to what I previously wrote about a gradient of disconnection from the environment.  I just posted it late on a previous weeks response, so please go back and take a look.  Basically, I am agreeing with you that there are Takers and Leavers, but that very few of us are the extreme one or the other.  Rather, we are living on a gradient of disconnection and it seems that the more we invent (DVDs, SUVs, satellite phones, etc), the less we understand our natural connection to the planet.  Arlo

===message:<br> Interesting! I now am thinking that in countries like the US, 
Europe and so on, we think that we should go all the way and then 
we can always fix problems with technology. I do believe that there 
is a brashness and a "can do" attitude in rich , technologically 
"advanced" countries. In coastal communities in the US we build, 
the ocean wrecks stuff, and then we just "fix it"! For example, we 
actually haul sand in to renourish beaches from the BAHAMAS! 
Wooo Hooo! And in the Bahamas they haul in coconut palm trees 
from tree farms in MIAMI since they don't have many palms in 
Nassau!
