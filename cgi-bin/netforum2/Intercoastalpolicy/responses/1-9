===message:You are so right that people who are living on the 
economic edge of life don't have the luxury of not eating, 
capturing and selling, or chopping down anything that 
will feed them. In Nassau at the fish market I asked a 
guy who had 2 large endangered turtles in the back of a 
pickup if he knew they were endangered. "I'm 
endangered Mon" he said as they prepared to 
slaughter the turtles.
