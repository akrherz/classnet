===message:It is true that America was not ready for the suffrage and civil rights of black men.  It is even sadder to think that it took 100 more years for America to get ready.  It can be speculated that things may have been different had the black population been allowed to purchase land but I believe that the South would have passed more "Black Codes" or found other ways to keep blacks from actually owning land.  Even the North where most of the supporters for suffrage resided was not ready for black equality.  It was a blight that only time could heal and not some feeble Act of Congress.

===message:It takes time to change the mind of a single man. It would take much longer to change the mind of an entire nation, a process still under way in this country. The changes of reconstruction could not be forced on the south even with the US Armys help. I do not believe that it would have worked. It took a 100 years to get to that point in American history. I suspose that it took another 100 years to undue it. Most people resist change.

===message:Reconstruction was a meant to be all things to and for everyone.Its main goal was to bring the South back into the Union under presidential directives.The successes of Reconstruction was the 13th,14th,and 15th Amendments. The thing that the Radical Repulicans was so infuriated over was the "black codes",setting black men free,but in words only. Black codes ensured the continual subservientude state, physically and mentally. Reconstruction only made life for the African Americans beneficial for a very short time. African Americans established churches, schools, and participated in,amd had a big impact on politics. The American founders of united government, who declared their independence from British rule,constructed the Constitution of these United States,and ordained Civil Rights,Proclaimed Emancipation, put forth good government,and humane principles,but in reality it didn't work for African Americans. Unfortunately, even though the Radical Republicans did many good things to carry out what the United States government was built-on,they were limited to what they could,would,should have done to fulfill the law of the land. When the terrorist acts of murder,burning,rape,and hangings of African Americans took place little or nothing was done by any one political group. The forward push toward industrialization,expanding westward,and getting rich from this countries natural resources was paramount in the minds of white Americans.There were little, or no thought of the perils of the Afican Americans,or their welfare.

===message:I agree with you and Carla.  I think Reconstruction did some good and even after 100+ years we are still trying to get equal rights for all mankind.  Suffrage of people should not be allowed and I think it is ashame that laws have to make any person treat all of mankind equal.
