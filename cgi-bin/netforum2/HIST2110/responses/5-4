===message:I agree with your statement.  I truly believe in our strong national government and feel that it was one of the two best things that came out of the Civil War, the other being the end of slavery.

===message:kevin, while i agree with your point about the sucessfulness and importance of this war, i disagree on a few things.  one, the civil war itself did not end slavery. slavery (while not in the degree it once had) still continued in some ares in the south. slaves having no where to go or any education many times stayed with their masters. slavery is like a running faucet, while yes the civil war did acomplish turning it "off" some drops still continued to fall.  two, are you sure it was 500,000 persons who were lost in the civil war? i could have sworn that it was 600,000 but in a time where not many records were kept i guess there might be a lot of conflicting numbers.

===message:You may be correct about the total number of deaths in the Civil War I was merely estimating.  The lives lost was not meant to be the focus of my discussion.  Secondly, we can not use one event and say that this particular action ended slavery.  Slavery faded off of a number of years after the war, but to use a event in history that undoubtedly began the process it would have to be the war. No, all the slaves were not "free" immediately after the war but the war was critical in ending the institution.

===message:I agree with you on your thoughts about the results f a stron national government.  I also think that death is a largeprice to pay, but your statement suggests the idea that the end justifies the means.  I agree with you.  The CIvil War also created many other benefits for the nation as well.  These benefits include a railroad, national bank and the weakening of states' rights.  I stated in my discussion why I think these were benefits (please feel free to read and reply to them).  I would like to know about your thoughts on these items and anyother thoughts you may have about the benefits the war may have created.  You can reply back under your name or mine if you like.

===message:I totally agree with your break down of the situation on the Civil War. The Civil War was the turning point and the being of what we see today. Even though I don't believe that slavery is totally over I do believe if it weren’t for the Civil War the world as we see it today wouldn't be. The price that was paid was very minimal compared to the benefits that we have and still are occurring from that war.

===message:That's true, were would we be today if there was not a civil war. The states would not be the same and the United States would not be able to stand strong as it exist today. There are so many people who wants to come to America because we are free and stand strong.
