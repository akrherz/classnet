===message:I agree - good points.  We also have to remember that even the political parties (Whigs, Democratics, and the Know-Nothings) had secetional splits over slavery.  I feel disunion and war was certain to happen given the fact that events taken place (Kansas-Nebraska Act, Dred Scott decision, Lecompton constitution, Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the Compromise of 1850) only brought about more controversy and not amicable solutions.

===message:I agreed with you up to the point of the difference in a fanatical leader or moderate.  I think that the difference would only be an issue of the time it took for succession and the Civil War.  Lincoln was somewhat of a moderate.  He wanted to stand firm on his party's ideals, but he still made sure not to be too strong in his comments.  For example, the statement he made about not agreeing with the tactics that John Brown used.  On the other hand, a fanatical leader would have fueled the fires more quickly by making statements the opposing side would have been offended by.  In either case, this would not have stopped the impending events.

===message:I agree and I think you made an excellent point in stating that the two different views between the north and south would eventually clash and would cause battles, raids and so forth. There is no way that they could seperate their views and ways of life regarding slavery, without eventually clashing with one another.
