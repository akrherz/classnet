===message:I agree with a lot of your argument, except one specific part.  You ask, "why would we give that much power back to a central government?"  I believe that the states would have had a difficult time governing themselves and interacting with the other states without a central government to pull the country together.  If each state had its own separate government with no standards set by a central government, it is easy to envision that each state's government would have eventually pulled so far away from the other state's governments, that there would be states fighting states before long.  I feel that the central government pulled the country together as one and eliminated the fear of tyranny by creating the very effective checks and balances system, which we still use today.

===message:Your point of view is very much accurate.  However, I based my answer on the idea that the States have just finished fighting a war against the British who ultimately wanted to control every aspect of America.  With that in mind I can imagine the states being reluctant to give away alot of power for the fear of turning into what they had just fought so hard to seperate from.  Remember this new form of Government had not been tried or tested.  I do not beleive America would have been very succesful without a strong national government, Britain had a strong central government also so what would be the assurance that America would not revert back to what they declared independance from.

===message:I think that it would be hard to say with certainty which way I would lean at that time. However considering that it took a unified group of states under central leadership to defeat the British I am inclined to lean toward the Federalist.  It was a dangerous time in history. France, Spain, England and others all would have liked to control America. If the states had stayed in a loose confederation our protection as a whole would have suffered. A foreign nation such as Spain with an eye on America might gamble that New York would not send aid to Georgia in the event of an invasion. This perception of weakness, real or otherwise, might led to many more conflicts. As an outside invading force I would much rather deal with a number of smaller uncoordinated defense armies than one large organized one.

===message:I totally agree with your point of view. To try a new system is just like trying a new restaurant when you are very hungry, not knowing what the food will taste like and even worst will the food meet your hungry needs or satisfaction. When there is talk about changing the laws, rules or how the government is going to be ran you are asking someone to try something that someone needs will not be meet and in this counrty that is just not fair when the only people that have a choice is the upper classes. Great point!!!
