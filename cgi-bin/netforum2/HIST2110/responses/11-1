 <p>I think multiculturalism is a double edged sword. On one hand, you give minorities, who typicly occupy the bottom rungs of society, a sense of identity and purpose that helps give them the pride and drive necessary to rise out of a cycle of poverty. That in turns helps the whole of society and helps bring races and ethnic groups closer to equality and evenutaly coexistance and cohabitation. In a racialy and ethnicly diverse country like the US, uniting factions is a urgent goal to preserve national unity.</p>
<p>On the other hand there is a dark side to multiculturalism which does not lead to unity or peacefull coexistance. Groups like the Black Panthers exhibited the failings of the multicultural movement in America. These groups never had a reasonable political agenda and were merely outlets for hate and frustration.</p>
<p>One coul argue that people are better off because of  these movements. They show how violent devisive organizations can spin off of legitimate political movements.</p>

===message:I agree, Chris.  On the whole, I think these movements were more beneficial than harmful.  I also think these movements were inevitable.  Since the beginning of mankind, conflict has existed among different groups of people.  For anyone to think that these movements could have been avoided would be incredulous.  Conflict between humans will always exist in some form or another.  Peace is a wonderful concept, but not a realistic one.  Controversy and conflict is necessary for our cultures and societies to evolve.

===message:What purpose did/does the KKK serve then and now.I totally diagree with violence,but sometimes non-violence is not the answer.Who demonstrated the violence on the red,black and brown people? Why are there wars against people because of the color of there skin,religious preference,culture,
country,natural resource in the area they live in that another society wants.What makes the dictatorship of one group of people more or less better than the dictatorship of another society. All of it is wrong in my opinion. We all should be able to live in peace with each other.Are things better off today than the 1960's, Yes,we are, at the expense of senseless lost of thousands of lives.

===message:Chris, although the violence demonstrated by the Black Panthers is undesirable and takes away from the movement, their Platform discussed under the Black Panthers link in the coursebook brings out a lot of injustices that were happening at the time, which were the reasons for their hate and frustrations.  Check it out.  I am not saying they were right in all their "wants" and "beliefs" but it is quite interesting.

===message:Lindsay,  Unfortunately I think your humanity is clouding the true issues.  What I think many dont want to accept is that though you may be of the same race you have difference of oppinion on how to get where you want to go.  The violent protestor were born from the non-violent ones.  They were tired of sitting around smoking a peace pipe while thier rights were being trampled on.  They were tired of getting caught up in the political toilet while thier families whent hungry.  I really think you could not have had one without the other and gotten results.

===message:Lindsay I also agree that the violence used by some people not only did not help but hindered that cause in which it was fighting for.  After reading many of these posts I am amazed to find how many people define violence and non-violence and how Malcolm X plays a part. What do you think?

===message:yes lindsay this is a perfect response. i agree with you. i don't think the violence was necessary because you can fight without violence as did king and his followers. however the initial goal of them all was to gain equality

===message:I think Martin Luther King, Jr., is a much greater man than any violent-oriented civil rights activist ever was.  He was non-violent and had strong morals and people hold him in the highest regard still today.  He's the prominent figure in civil rights history and accomplished the most.  Any of those who used violence to work towards their goals do not deserve the respect that MLK, Jr., gets, and NO ONE remembers their birthdays.  It is possible to get results in a peaceful manner, as has been proven.

===message:Well, as far as Malcolm X is concerned, I have no respect for his methods of activism.  Although he made it known that he intended not to use physical violence, he did use violence in another way--verbally!  His goal was not for unity and peace, but rather for his people to separate themselves from the "white devils".  That, to me, seems like the total opposite of what this country needs.

===message:One issue that I have is that we as a society, (no matter what country) send out double messages.  If a group or organization uses violence to atain their goals this is seen as a negative thing that brings about nothing good for anyone.  On the other hand when as a country, we have a dispute with another country and have tried to resolve issues or attain a goal through other means, we will fight.  Each of these movement used violent and nonviolent methods in order to make their points known and gain a sense of equality in terms of housing, education, employment, etc.  You are right, the violent methods probably did not work, but the question is why.  Why doesn't violence work in some situations, but is seen as the only solution in others?
