===message:You have some good points but I feel that you missed one major aspect.  The disagreement was not solely based upon political difference.  The British found that it was not so easy to back up there words when William Pitt aggreed to pay the expenses if the Americans provided the men.  It was more economical if anything.  The Citizens in Britain were going through some difficult times because of the tremendous debt the Parliment incurred will fighting the war.  They felt the answer was to make the Americans pay.

===message:I also believe it was economically.  All the laws and policies passed (Sugar Act, Stamp Act, and Tea Act) were all revenue raising measures to benefit Britain only.  Although the American colonies hoped for reconcilation, they also wanted the British government to understand that it lacked authority to levy taxes outside Britain and to deny a person a jury trial.  This created misunderstanding between the British goverment and the colonies.  The Brtish government felt as the "mother country" what they were asking for was reasonable, whereas the colonies felt what the British was asking for was wrong, a burden and irritating.
