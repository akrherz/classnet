===message:Al, I agreed with you all the way except for your take whether these groups were more divisive than helpful.  I do think that when the minority goes up against the majority in a threatening or violent manner it is divisive.  The majority becomes so caught up in what the group is doing, they don't look at why they are doing it.  This defeats the whole purpose.  It's just like if someone called me the "B" word and I slapped them.  No one may remember that the person called me that word, only my action of slapping them, or getting loud and cursing them out.  These movements were very important for these minority groups (internally), but how much were they really able to change.  Someone told me recently that "Small tangible steps are important to reach larger goals".  I believe these movements made some of those small steps and that we are still moving towards the goal.

===message:i would have to disagree with you on your idea that these movements were not divisive.  i believe that when the groups turned militant they lost a certain degree of credibility.  they may have also lost support of some legislators in washington.

===message:I think what you are missing is that you had both on both sides.  For those who remained to be non violent they did not start being violent because other did.  The same is for those who were against equal rights.  It took all to make it a success!
