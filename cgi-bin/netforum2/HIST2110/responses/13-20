===message:I have to totally disagree with you.  Reagan did spend a lot of time focusing on foreign affairs, yet he spent a lot of time trying to improve domestic affairs as well.  Reagan spent a lot of money on military expedenture's for the purpose of our national security.  Today, with the event's of 9/11 and with the past threats of Saddam's posession of chemical weapons, would you want the Presidential administration to spend money on military expedenture's for the safety of our country?  I KNOW I WOULD.  A lot of what you stated seems to be a dislike for Republican Presidents instead of fact-based information.  My one question is, how is the current Presidency of George W. Bush spiraling down since he has just led a victorious war against Iraq for the purpose of my protection and yours?  I know I wouldn't want to wait around for Saddam to attack me.

===message:Great note Bethany. One other thought. All of that spending employed countless Americans in high paying jobs. It allowed the corporate shareholders to be paid dividends. They in turn reinvested in other companies creating more jobs. It was called trickle down economics. I for think that it worked pretty well, it helped feed my family for many years.

===message:You are right thing were looking a little better once Clinton was in office, but when Bush II is now in office things are getting worse. That a good point; about the American people were only focusing on themselves and trying to better their way of living.

===message:I've noticed how when things go wrong with the country, a lot of people tend to blame the president.  I believe the president really does try his best to make decisions that will help the country.  When something goes wrong these people make it seem as though he was only doing it for himself.  The president has a very important job, because whatever he decides to do affects the whole country.  I guess people are just going to have their own opinions about him regardless.  (And by "the president", "he", and "him" I don't mean Bush in particular, just the president in general).

===message:i don't feel that because a president can win a war should be the sole reason that is a great president. you are obviously a republican just as you assumed that i am a democrat so of course we will have different opinions and perspectives. :0)

===message:hi ashley, 

you stated that you don't understand why when something goes wrong with the country some people blame the president. well i don't know but it may be because the president would be considered in YOUR and other people's corner. however this is just a reoccurence of past issues where the president does nearly nothing for minorities. so if you don't have a president who is all for change and helping EVERYONE and not just those of the elite and (for right now) the majority, then yes they won't be supportive of him when the country that HE is running has to be involved in a war. thanks for your opinion though :0)
