===message:I disagree; I do not think that there were a lot of women in the work force because their place was in the home. That’s true that some of them had to work but that was a very small percent.

===message:Kevin, I agree with your assessment of a woman's life in the 1950s.  The picture you describe about the wife vacuuming in pearls while she waits for her husband to come home is how I always remember Mrs. Cleaver, which is an excellent example of how TV stereotyped women of the 1950s.
