===message:I think the Southerners "political dissent" at this time was all in their attitude. The South at that time needed to have the North exhibit some control over them because they had rebelled, but I think that just made the Southerners more bitter towards the North.  I don't think that there would have been a way to change the attitudes of the Southerners towards being defeated and being ruled by the North.  Both sides didn't see themselves as wrong so neither side was willing to make concessions.  However, the South only had as much power as the North allowed them to have.
