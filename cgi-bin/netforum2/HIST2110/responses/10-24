===message:And no women, were not better off in the 1950s than they are today in regards to education and working. Opportunities are boundless for women of today. While there is still a glass ceiling in the workforce, we still are much better of today than in the 1950s. Today we make significant contributions in the areas of science, educaiton, etc. Perhaps, family values have shifted from that of the 1950s because of the divorce rate, single parent families have risen, and some women are choosing to go it alone in raising families.
