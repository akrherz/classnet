===message:I am not quite sure how you came to believe that the North enslaved the South.  I am also not quite sure how you can believe that the North was blaming the South.  Yes, some people thought that the South should be punished for succeeding from the Union, but how did the North do this?  Slavery became a part of the Civil War after it had begun; the original beginnings of the Civil War came from the South and North’s mistrust of each other and the belief of states’ rights.  From my readings, I gained another view point.  I am interested to see how you gained these insights.

===message:I think I can see both sides to this.  Kevin, I believe, is referring to the Union Army capturing slaves early in the war and using them as labors (i.e. cooks) for its troops, with this point I agree with Kevin.  However, James’ reply about slavery becoming an issue after the war was begun on the basis of mistrust, I agree too.

===message:Southern slave owners didn't view slaves as people, they saw them as property the same as a farmer views his cattle.  They saw slaves as a necessary means to manitain the aristocratic lifestyle to which they were accustomed.  However they felt that the North wanted to destroy this lifestyle by abolishing slavery, and was using political means to do this.  Southerners felt that the North was trying to "enslave" them by enacting laws prohibiting the expansion of slavery into the new western territories, and eventually abolishing slavery altogether.

===message:James-i read the same text  you did and when i use the term "enslaving", in reference to the north and south, is not meant literally.  the north by forcing its view on the south and its moral standards on the new territories created acted as dominant "masters" to the subserviant south.  i hope this helps you understand my "insight".

Michael-im glad you understood what i was trying to get across and i agree with your add-ons.
