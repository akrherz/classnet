===message:You have some excellent points in your statement, but I don't feel that you addressed the major issue which was slavery.  The confederate states were not so worried about a national banking system and gold to seperate from the union.  They were more concerned about the national government moving toward abolishing slavery in the states.  The issue was the rights and powers of the states to have slaves, not so much as the banking system which you elaborated on.  The civil war was basically fought over the institution of slavery.

===message:Although I agree with you that the national banking system was necessary, I also feel that ending slavey was the important aspect of the war.  Slavery was the moral and political foundation of southern society.  Ending slavery was a direct attack on the Confederate Constitution.  Also, how ironic that the fall of Atlanta and the Sherman's March through Georgia greatly contributed to the fall of southern society.
