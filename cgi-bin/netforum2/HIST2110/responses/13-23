===message:You brought up a good point that the U.S. is the only surviving Super Power in the world.  When you think that only 20 years ago the U.S. and U.S.S.R were potentially ready to have a nuclear war, I think we are much better off than before.  We will never be able to get rid of all our problems, but the longer we work on them the smaller the problems will become.
