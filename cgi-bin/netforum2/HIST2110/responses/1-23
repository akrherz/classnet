===message:I was with you right up until the end. I think that what American colonists had going for them that the other colonies lacked were leaders who were children of the Enlightenment. Men like Jefferson, Adams, Paine and Franklin had come of age in a time when Britain and France were contemplating basic human rights. I think that maybe we won the Revolutionary War because we had wise, enthusiastic coaching.
