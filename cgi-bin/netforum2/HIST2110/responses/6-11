===message:I disagree that all of the goals of Reconstruction were not met.  I think that that is one of the major reasons for it's collapse.  Was there really concrete goals set?  Did the government make all efforts to secure and complete those goals?  I think not.  Some positive outcomes were that freedman were able to reform and strenghthen the black family, establish African American churches in order worship as they chose, participate in the public school system as well as higher level education.  Remember Howard, Fisk, and Hampton Universities were started during this time.  Reconstruction showed freedman what they could have, and how it should be no matter how short lived.
