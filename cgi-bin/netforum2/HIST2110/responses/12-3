===message:Kathryn, I agree, two wrongs don't make a right; however, I have to disagree with your sentiment that both president's were "equally" wrong.  Clinton did something that so many other men in the world do that it is just shy of being "acceptable."  On the other hand, Nixon chose to decive the people of the United States and did so illegally, I think his offense was much worse than Clinton's!  I also totally agree with Lindsay!  We are MUCH better off than those other countries!

===message:Kathryn, I too agree that we should be able to be able to trust in our president but let us remember that he is a man.  Not reverend Clinton, not general Clinton, not pastor Clinton, just plain ole Bill Clinton.  I dont see how you can link communism and 3rd world countries in the same category.  Communist countries are communist because of political reasons, third world countries are third world because they have no food...  neither deals with morality.

===message:I think you made an excellent point in stating that both Clinton and Nixon were equally wrong for what they did because they were supposed to have moral characters befitting their postion.  This is such a true statement because when we elect a President, they are put in the highest position in our country and even though they are not perfect, they were chosen not only because of their political views, but their moral view's as well, and the American people expect them to uphold those views in leading our country.  As you said Kathryn, who can we trust if we can't trust our President to do the right thing?  Unfortunately, since the Watergate scandal, the American people will never again trust the Presidency like they did before.
