===message:It is obvious from the events that let to war, that Japan made every move leading up to war.  They didn't honor the Open Door Policy, they invaded China, they wouldn't negotiate with the U.S., and they also formed an alliance with Germany and Italy which proved that they had no intentions of negotiation which could have avoided a war.  A peace negotiation could have been accomplished, but in this case, Japan was in no way considering any kind of peace negotiation.  Therefore, war could not have been avoided.  Hopefully in the future, there will be more peace negotiations and less war.  Yet, it takes both sides for there to be peace.
