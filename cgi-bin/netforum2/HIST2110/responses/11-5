===message:Your assesment is very good.  I feel that the violence though unwanted had to be a part of it also.  Looking at the text we find that everytime an attempt for racial equality was attempted with peaceful means it quickly got swept away.  Unfortunaltely they lived and we live in a society that tends not to want to hear the squeaky wheel until the brakes fail and we crash into something.

===message:I like the way you broke everything on down like that.  That's a good way to study and learn from.  You're right when you said these "movements succeeded in raising the consciousness of the young generation".  Because they really did learn a lot from their elders.  It made them believe in everything more strongly.  That's how our current society came to be about, and it's still improving.  The more we teach the children right, the better our future will be.
