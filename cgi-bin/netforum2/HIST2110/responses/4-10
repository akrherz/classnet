===message:I agree with you Kristi.  I see both sides.  And both sides were equally wrong.  With such an issue as dealing with people who are treated as objects, there is no easy answer.  There would never have been an easy solution.  I know this because we are still dealing with the results of it today.  People are still hung up on the idea even though it was so long ago.

===message:That is so true!  The North and the South were very stubborn about what they thought was right, when both of them were wrong in some kind of way.  I also believe there was no way they could have compromised with one another without fighting over this matter.

===message:You brought up an interesting, and often overlooked, point about the slavery issue.  While the North wanted to abolish slavery, many didn't want anything to do with these freed slaves.  They certainly didn't view them as equals and went so far as to try to ban them from entering some of the states.  They were seen as a threat to low income workers in the large cities, so they were viewed with discontent even where they were allowed to go.

===message:I totally agree with your point of view. Both sides were selfish in there own way in views on slavery. The white did not believe that the black were equal to them to work by them in the North and the South felt that the blacks place was as the help only. The emotions on each side ran deep within there part of the world and each side was real passionate about the issue.
