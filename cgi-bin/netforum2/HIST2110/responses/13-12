===message:Diplomacy was built from prior presidents.  I feel the Cold War was melted by a number of things.  I feel we just forgot about China and thought it would just go away and now we see that that is not so.The Economy cant not be judged by the economist it is judged by the people and we see that the rich pad thier economy with high salaries and perks just like during the Reagan Years.  Environment concerns are very serious and still remained a non issue in politics.
