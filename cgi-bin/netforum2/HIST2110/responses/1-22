===message:I agree with you.  You made a very good point about how "right and wrong is completely in the eye of the beholder."  I believe that our opinion of how the whole conflict was depends on where we come from, because if we were British then our perspective would probably be different from what it is from an American's point-of-view.

===message:I would be curious to hear more from you about why you side with the British. For me, the bottom line was that the British denied the Americans representation. While I agree that the British viewed the colonies as an investment, they seemed to have managed it poorly. Perhaps if the implementors of their policy had been better chosen, they could have worked through the crisis more successfully. Or perhaps if the emerging leaders of America hadn't studied the concept of human rights with British educators they would have remained the docile sheep the world would rather us to be, even today.
