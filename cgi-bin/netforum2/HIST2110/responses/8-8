===message:Kathryn, I agree!  The U.S. obviously benefited from the war on the “home front” economically; however not socially because of the continued prejudices, but I won’t get into that.  Force is the only language that people like Hitler understood, then and now!

===message:You are absolutely correct!  When a nation or leader decides that they are going to act a certain way or undertake certain activities, regardless of the consequences, than war may be unaviodable.  In this case, Hitler continued to make demands on Europe, such as remilitarizing the Rhineland and annexing the Sudatenland, and the major European powers continued to turn a blind eye to avoid war.  However the more Hitler got the more he wanted, until Europe decided to stop giving in to his demands.  He then decided to take what he wanted by force, and began WWII.  Japan acted in much the same way in Asia, taking what they wanted regardless of the consequences.  In these instances, war in unavoidable.

===message:I also agree...although war is avoidable, the future of a country could be changed based on avoiding a conflict.  If the US had stayed neutral or agreeded to the terms set by countries like Japan or Germany our history would have to be rewritten.  I do not believe that our country would be what it is today if we avoided conflict, we thrive in the role of international policemen and our country reaps the benefits of from our alliances.
