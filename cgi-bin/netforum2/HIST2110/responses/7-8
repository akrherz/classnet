===message:You were right when u said propaganda had a major impact on how many people looked at war as being either good or bad.  They didn't really think things out.  All they really did was listen to what the media was sayin.  And the part about how America thought it was invincible is also true, because nobody expected anything like what happened on 9/11 was going to happen.
