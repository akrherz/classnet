===message:You make some very valid points.  The U.S. has put themselves in a position of protecter for the other countries of the world.  This position has resulted in having to involve ourselves in War or other measures, that we otherwise may not have.  We always say we will stay neutral, but by giving aid and so forth to combatants, we drag ourselves in the middle of the disputes and are forced to choose sides or make a stand.  My concerns look more at the home front.  What are we doing to improve things at home?  With all the positive stridee that American have made, we still have much improvement to go.  I personally think that concentrating outward helps avoid what is going on in our own front yard.
