===message:A good point was made that we need to support our soldiers who are fighting this war.  If it weren't for them, we as Americans, would not have the freedoms that we have now. The people who are opposing this war are taking these freedoms for granted and are forgetting, like Kevin said, that war is what gave us our freedoms.  As much as repression and control seemed wrong during World War 1, it almost was better because American was then united and supported the soldiers and had more patriotism, whereas today, people seem so ungrateful and unsupportive of our troops that are risking their lives right now in Iraq.  Even if some disagree with war, they need to support the troops, who are their defending all of our rights.

===message:I agree that we should support our troops no matter what and I feel that it was war that gave us our freedom but to me back in history the war was worth the fight but today this war is not worth the fight when it is for personal gain or feelings I believe that people are allowing their feelings for this war effect their feelings for our troops
