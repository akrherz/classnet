===message:I also agree with the Antifederalist view.  Not even division of power could be achieved when property and money seem to be the basis of authority.  Even though the Federalist proposed a check and balance of the national and state government, whats right for the state may not be good for the nation.

===message:I also agree.  It is funny that the things the anti-federalist were fighting back then would boil over onto what we have in front of us today.  In a land of equality we are all branched into upper, middle, and lower classes.  Which class do you think would have the most power?  Well, the ones that pay the most taxes.

===message:I couldn't agree more Johnetta.  I would have felt as the anti-federalists felt because forming a national government gave more power to the rich, who did not represent the majority of the population.  Since the power was not balanced, I would agree with the anti-federalists in saying that the Constitution was not "federalist" at all.  Today, I still feel as if the upper class have more power in politics.   It is funny how some things still haven't changed.
