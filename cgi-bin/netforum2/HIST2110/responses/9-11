===message:I am in total agreement with you.  Reading alot of the discussions not many people share this view.  The hysteria was caused by the threat the Russians posed to the Americans.  We were not the only super power any longer.  The Russians were a legitimate world power along with us.

===message:I would have to agree with you as well!  I think there are two more reasons why Americans are so prone to panic. One being second hand information. Like the news, this is when the duck tape and plastic come into play. Another reason is  the fact that,  Americans  just don’t have faith in the government any more.  I mean who could beam us!  One day the government is insuring us that our country is safe, and that same day we have an terrorist attack (9/11).  If you can’t believe in your government then who do you believe in? And this along would cause any one to panic!!
