===message:Kevin:  While I agree that money is, and probably always has been, a major issue when it comes to disputes between countries, I get the impression that you think this may be the only contention between the U.S. and Japan.  Imagine if Japan had taken control of China and, being that Japan, Germany, and Italy had an alliance, what do you think the consequences would be if these three countries had such powerful control over the world?  Obviously, if the pact gained control of China, a very large country, they would have more man power to take control of other countries, which was clearly their intent.  If these three continued to take over more and more countries, eventually they would make their way to the U.S.  I don't know about you, but I like my president and our government.  Who knows what kind of person(s) we would be governed by had we allowed Japan to continue taking over the way they intended.  It could be another Hitler!  Just a thought...

===message:You are correct, however I feel that the Alliances Japan made with Germany and Italy opened a few eyes as well.

===message:Kevin, I do agree that China invasion would have cause economical distress in the United States. On the other hand, I feel that another reason for policeing was to put a stop to communism. Communism was spreading fast. The dictators of the Axis knew that every country that was successfully  seize, would only make their military stronger. Who do you think would have been next?

===message:I kind of disagree with you on the part about how you thought there is no way to avoid an armed conflict.  I believe that an armed conflict could be avoided, although you were right about how money is the major factor causing this conflict.  If a country is able to make use of what they already have, without becoming greedy, then they wouldn't have to invade another country for its resources.
