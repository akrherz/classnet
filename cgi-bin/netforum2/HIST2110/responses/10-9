===message: I agree with you that it is difficult to compare the different eras do to the fact it was a different time. In different times in life and different cultures things are done in different ways but do you think that as time change a little of the past goes with changes?

===message:You did a great job, but I just had one point that I wanted to include.  As you stated, women were just beginning the transition of working out of the home in the 1950's.  I disagree slightly because a lot of women worked out of the home during World War 2, so this wasn't a brand new transition for them.  Also, during this time, 2 million more women were working outside the home than during the war, so if anything, I would say that this wasn't the beginning of women working outside the home, but that the numbers were growing higher than ever before.  I thought you made some excellent points and I just wanted to add that in.  Great Job!

===message:Women played a significant part of the workforce.  Though it was not a daily announcement.  Many women remained on the jobs that was held during the war.

===message:Thank you for your reponse.  I have just one question.  You mentioned that there were more woman working our of there homes during WWII.  Do you think the same number of woman would have been working if not for the war?

===message:These women were working because of the shortage of labor due to most men participating in the war.  These women were not working just because they wanted to.
