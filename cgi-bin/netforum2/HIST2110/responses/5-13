===message:  <P>This is realy off topic, but I couldn't resist replying. The people who advocate the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of their heritage have valid points. The flag was in no way associated with slavery. It wasn't even an official flag of the Confederacy. It was used by troops, but was not the flag of the Confederacy. The Confederacy had one or two official flags, which nobody even knows or cares about. The battle flag is simply to remember the sacrifice of Confederate veterans fighting to defend their homeand.</p>
<P>On the other hand, where were the Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy when the Klan and other racist groups were using the flag as a symbol of their cause? Where was the protest when the Georgia assembly changed the flag to use the battle flag as a protest against integration? In my opinion, they lost alot of their argument when they failed to preserve and protect their symbol from misuse. The Swatztika was original some Greek symbol, but I think its original meaning has been lost. It's now a symbol of Nazis, and I think the same thing has happened with the battle flag.</P>
<P>However, I'm astounded by how much resources the NAACP has chosen to waste on this issue. I find it completely ridiculous. They managed to change or remove flags in several states, but for what gain? Are black people better off because of it? I just don't see it. One NAACP spokesperson (I can't recall his name or position) said, in reference to a popular vote on the Georgia flag, that "Most people in Georgia would vote for a return of the Confederate flag, but most people would vote for a return of slavery." I think that is completely absurd. In my eyes it's just another example of how civil rights leaders are struggling to find a cause to fight for. I think that's a great thing, but they need to reevaluate their purposes and pursue a more modern platform for their constituants.</p>

===message:I suppose this I can weigh in on this as well. I liked the old Georgia flag for a few reasons. I would support changing the flag again, but not to our last flag. I have deep roots in the state of Georgia. Although none of my family ever owned slaves several of them did fight for the south, their homeland.  I can show you the markers of family members how died in the war. My GGG Grandfather a Confederate Dr. died in an Illinois prison camp. So to me the old flag and the confederate battle flag represents some family history. Onto the lamer reasons for supporting it and I know they are lame it’s just how I feel. I always liked the look of our old flag compared to other state flags. To me it just looked good. It was the flag (state) which I was born and raised under. I was used to it and like many people don’t care for change. The way that the flag was changed upset many people – last minute back room deals hidden from public view. And lastly I think the new flag is ugly. As a native Atlantan I can remember how life here was in the 70’s and how it started to change in the 80’s with the massive influx of transplants. Many long time friends and I sometimes feel as if any and all traces of that way life is eroding away. This city is now filled by matchbox homes on postage stamp lots occupied by folks who don’t eat grits think that barbecue is a verb and believe that a southern drawl makes you dumb. The flag was just another notch in erasing the southerness of Atlanta and Georgia. As Lewis Grizzard once said “We don’t care how you used to do it in New Jersey.” So for me at least it is not about hate but more a matter of holding on to a small piece of my childhood.
