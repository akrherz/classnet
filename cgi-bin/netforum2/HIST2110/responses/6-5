===message:Although I agree with you that the overall theme of Reconstruction was not fulfilled, I find it sad that the positive points that were accomplished for African-Americans don't seem to be recognized.  If it was not for the ability to attend schools, universities, work for wages, participation in government and elections, own land, worship freely which came about because of the Reconstruction.  I trully think that these events shaped the African-American in terms of the desire to have and do more.  I also think that the early demise of Reconstruction stunted minority growth at a point that effects the African-Americam race even today.
