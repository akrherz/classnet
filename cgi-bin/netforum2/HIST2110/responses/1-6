===message:I disagree on the notion that both parties were unwilling to compromise and that the colonies were responsible for paying for a war debt that was fought largely at their expense. Pitt’s logic was that the American’s would supply the bulk of the manpower for the Western war effort and would not be liable for the financial costs of the war, because retaining and expanding the American colonies was in the best long-term interest of the English treasury. As was illustrated in the coming years, England’s economy was heavily dependent on trade with the American colonies. Pitt knew the worth of the colonies and England’s responsibility to defend them, but also knew that he could use Colonial bodies to fill the ranks for a much cheaper war. In repayment for their bloodshed, the colonists would be reimbursed for their war costs.

===message:I totally agree with the fact that the British were greedy.  Colonists should have not been expected to participate in any taxation to benefit the King and/or Parliament's war debt.  On the other hand, I don't think both the Colonists and British were unwilling to compromise.  I got the impression that the Colonists were willing to give a little, just not a lot, to the Parliament who was not giving them proper representation.

===message:The one thing I believe your post is missing is the fact that the British were not only trying to secure repayment of debt from the Americans, they were also trying to raise revenue to pay their own royals and officers, who were clearly not selected by the colonists.  The colonists did not have much to say about who Parliment had in their cabinet and yet they had to pay extra taxes to provide revenue for these people?  It hardly seems fair.

===message:I agree that both parties were at fault.  Your reasoning is well stated, as well.  I also feel that the British were just as much to blame as the American colonies were.  However, I do not feel that the French and Indian War was the Briton’s war.  I believe that as colonies of Britain, the Americans were just as much concerned with the war as Britain.  After all, the Americans could either take Britain’s side or the French’s side.  Yet, they tool the British side, showing their support and want for British rule.  This could also be due to the fact that the French may have never made an offer to the Americans.  Either way, the Americans choose to fight for the British, and doing so, the war became just as much theirs as the Britons’.  They were fighting for their freedom, and the British were fighting for their lands.
