===message:I agree with you until you get to the avoidance of war.  I feel most conflicts are avoidable unless thier are alterior reasons for the conflicts.  But the sad part is that it only takes a pebble of sand thrown in the wrong persons face that causes hundreds of thousands of troops to put thier lives on the line for people who really dont care about the cause or results.
