===message:Great comparison!  I would have never thought of this kind of comparison! I totally agree with your thinking, there would be outrage if our government pulled something like that!

===message:100% in agreement!  As I read Chapter One and the events that led up to the Declaration of Independence and the Revolutionary War I kept thinking about our government. If our government were to attempt to ENFORCE an unlawful law or impose a tax on Americans they could very well be "tarred and feathered" or worse.  Initially, colonists did not oppose the taxation as much as they opposed the lack of representation (being bullied).  Parliment enacted the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act for the benefit of Britain not to benefit the colonists.  When we elect government officials we elect them on the basis of their ability to represent and voice our views and opinions not to undermine and overshadow them and if they do they are not re-elected.  If the British government had been FAIR in their approach to tax the colonists,the colonists I believe would have been more receptive and may have conceded to some (not all) of the tax laws simply because they were given the chance to be heard instead of being ignored and bullied.

===message:I am in agreement with Mike Sanders. The American people never received in represenation and was never allowed a true vote for themselves and as a result the British acted as bullies and continued to tax the colonies.
