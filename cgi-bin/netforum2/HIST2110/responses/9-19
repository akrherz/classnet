===message:I think it was much more than a bandwagon.  The Russians were emerging as a legitimate Super Power.  Americans could no longer hold the threat of the atomic or hydrogen bomb as it's trump card.  The Russians were equally as powerful to the Americans in regards to nuclear bombs.  The threat the Russian sposed was more of a cause for hysteria than your bandwagon idea.

===message:I absolutely agree with you.  That has been one of the best ones I have read so far.  Until I read your response, I didn't even realize how much Americans are so sensitive to small stuff.  We have it great over here.  I think we dramatize everything too much, therefore making us look like we can't small problems that come our way.  Look on the bright side, I thank God that I am in the United States and not in one of middle-eastern countries!  9/11 did reshape our thinking though.  I believe that we united as a country and gained patriotism.

===message:I agree with your answer.  We are real good at pointing fingers at one another.  That never really solves anything.  Media did cause everyone to form their negative opinions about the 9/11 tragedy.  Before it occurred, nobody really thought anything like that would ever happen to our country, but it did.  It is messed up how something like that actually had to take place in order to knock some sense into everybody.  I also believe the news over reacts about things like that, and after watching it for so long it causes us to over react about everything.  And that's not good, it's just causing everyone to panic and stress out even more.

===message:As we have read these last few chapters, I have noticed that there is always some way in which the public chooses something that the prey of it's which hunt.  It makes you wonder if we are being led today.  Hmmm, are we?????

===message:Andrew, It is true people are confused about what to do or think. They will turn on the radio, television, read the news paper headlines,or call someone on the telephone in order to be told what to except/reject into their minds.It is funny how all the historical enemies are friends with America today. All the sacrifices of lost lives in wars will eventually be a thing of the past. Propaganda does its meaning well.Controlling the minds is the key in all societies by those in authority every since the beginning of time. Not saying all was wrong or all was right,but we learn through knowledge how to be civilized. I pray for World Peace and Hope for our future.My reply maybe off key,but this is where I am in time. I was just looking at the injured in our current state of warfare.
