===message:Bravo!  I totally agree.  I sometimes get very discouraged with the thought that many feel that these different movements had no purpose.  I feel that many people feel that equal rights regardless of your skin would have happened anyway.  How wrong they are.  I agree totally with you assesment.  They truly had to happen and they had to happen exactly how they happened.  Some in peace and some in violence because this also showed America that though we are the same race we still differ in the way we deal with situations.

===message:I agree, all the different groups were trying to look out for their own people. There was no unity among either group because each group felt second-class to the other group. But, each group was struggling with the same issues: education, jobs, economy status, and poverty. They felt the only way to strengthen their culture was to help only their people.

===message:I agree with your points of view all things happen for a reason and they also happen on time so these 3 movements happen at a time when it was really needed. I do believe that each group did the correct thing by first working amongst themselves before trying to work with each other groups because first you have to be able to work amongst your people before trying to work with others. I do not agree with violence but I do believe in getting  my point across and sometimes that take a little force. Great Job!!!
