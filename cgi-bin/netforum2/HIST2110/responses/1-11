===message:I agree with you on most of what you said about misunderstandings on both shores, but I question whether the British felt that the colonies were separate at first?  It seems that because they felt that they were British citizens living somewhere else, that the colonies were as responsible as those still in Britain for paying for things like the military.  Especially when the military was used on their behalf as well.

===message:I totally agree with you noone can be singal out and blame for this situation. The British did see only dollar signs and treated the Americans like they were not human so they did not have to understand or for that matter care how the Americans felt.
