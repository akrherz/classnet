===message:Actually, agriculture in the South remained for the most part.  I have read, and the sources could be inaccurate (highschool textbooks aren't always correct) that the South did "rise again" in that it rebuilt.  The South did manage to pay off its war-debt and in a respectable amount of time.  But in the beginning, with little captial to start industry, the South once again turned to farming.  The institution of share cropping began and in some places, slavery continued.

===message:The banking system was a great establishment for the American system. It gave support for the New World. The farmers no longer had slaves so they had to change their life style and make so other way to survive.
