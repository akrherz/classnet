===message:Kevin, 
I know, I for one, would completely freak out if my check were shorted over 5 dollars. So, I can totally sympathize with the American government and their need for economic contro during this turbulent time.  Being prosperous is not greedy, it is the "rags to rich's" story that makes this country great(its people and its government).

===message:A common saying in America is that money is not everything.  This should be immediately followed by "i would like to see you love without it.  I totally agree with your discussion.  Ever country, every state, and every person has to have money.  When this money is lost, one is usually going to follow.  You made a good point.  It is survival, not greed.

===message:I don’t think its greed; I think that is just how people are and how society is in general. Which, people do what they have to, in order to survive in society.

===message:I agree that that was a major contributing factor to why the United States went to war with Japan.  However, it fails to mention that THEY attacked us!  Had they not done so we would have most likely continued negotiations.  The Japanese made a gamble and lost.  Had they not attacked, the trade embargo would have continued and they would have been weakened by the loss of materials whereas we would have had time to strengthen ourselves.  They knew that.  Another reason we went to war is that we needed to check their advancement.  Any chess player or risk player will tell you that if you let an enemy or much worse enemies amass against you then your chances become less and less of being able to contain them.  You must attack before they have the chance to get any more strength.  It is not always about money, but sometimes that is a factor

===message:You are correct but the bottom line was the Japanes attempt to invade China.  If the Japanese would not have made this move their would not have been a need for conflict.  Not to mention this conflict began long before the threat of communism.  If it was not for the financial interest the U.S. had in China their would have been no conflict.  The proof is in the Americans handling of Hitler.  The government tried everything within it's power to remain neutral.  Hitler was an enemy who posed a huge threat, but the government did not hastily check his advances, why?  Simple, Hitler had not imposed on American dollars.
