===message:Yes, the stereotypes that existed were more than likely fueled by the militarism that some of the groups within these movements held.  However, I believe that it is through the entire movement that everyone benefited.  Even though the entire movement was not as uniform and did not use the same measures as other groups within the movement, the fact that the movement took place with everyone wanting and expressing their feelings and needs led to the eventual political force that they gained.  As I feel that these movements were the foundation to the gaining of a political force, I believe that the impact of these movements were quite extensive.

===message:How do you fight a system that is designed to oppress you?  You can not mount a legal attle because they are the ones who enforce these unjust laws.  At some point you reach your boiling level and figure enough is enough.  How long should you sit idle and wait for some president to finally drop some equal rights into your lap.  These movements served as an eye opener to society to let them know that these groups will no longer leave in an oppressive society.  I do think your percentages are way off the mark.  I think you can contribute nearly 95% of the changes in society to these civil rights movements.
