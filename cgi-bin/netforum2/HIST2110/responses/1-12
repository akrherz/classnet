===message:I disagree in that the word “reasonable” implies that some air of fairness exists when in actuality there was none.  The British government attempted to impose their WILL, which history has shown time and time again does not always include or take into account the rights or wills of others.  The colonists did attempt to express their discontentment towards internal taxes, such as the Sugar Act but were ignored.  Instead they were hit with an additional tax (Stamp Act), which was parliaments way of saying we don’t care what you want or think.

I believe like many of my classmates that the British government having reigned so supremely and unchallenged for so long felt as if they could simply do what ever they wanted to the colonists and not encounter any resistance. The colonists had every right to stand up for their freedom and to demand that they not be treated merely as puppets on a string but as human beings.  

Although, spurred on by Parliament’s insistence to unfairly tax the colonists, I believe that America would have sought her independence ultimately. Britain was not willing to allow the new world (America) to blossom and take on her own identity (i.e. Declaratory Act), they wanted to reign supreme as they had always done, they wanted to mirror Old England in the New World and that could not be.  America was a new frontier and beginning for all who came, which meant that the past would ultimately have to concede to the future.

===message:The British government was not being fair in the taxation of the colonies. The taxation came from the British trying to get out of a budget crisis from the previous wars. The British never explained their position to the Americans in their efforts to reduce their deficit that they believed they assisted and helped the Americans in the war within the United States borders; therefore, the Americans responded by stating that they were being taxed with no legal representation and that the British empire were collecting money to control the colonies, which led to the revolution between the British and the colonies.

===message:i believe that is a good point, that the British did not make their point clear in establishing taxes to pay for the war-debt.  if they had clarified the reasons for the taxation the colonists may not have responded so negatively, so quickly.  however, the British may have acted arrogantly and believed that no explanation was necessary.  they may have felt that the colonies must pay the taxes without any explanation.

===message:I think your description of the "one-up" game played between the colonies and Briton is a great way to summarize what happened.  As you stated, this let to a snowball effect, escalating the tensions between the colonies and Briton.  If the two sides had sat down and discussed the reasons for their opinions, the entire situation may have been avoided. It is similar to what frequently happens in a parent-child relationship, which is similar to the situation between Briton and the colonies

===message:I don't think that both sides could have sat down and calmly discussed taxation of the colonies.  Both sides had strong feelings on the matter.  Britain felt they were the holder of the power and they could do as they saw fit.  If they were to have sat down and discussed the matter it would have been unproductive.  The British had already agreed to fund the war and then decided that it cost more than they thought and wanted to get out of debt.  The problems with taxation was one that had to be settled for the good of the Americans.
