===message:I do not know if anyone can say that Clinton would have bee elected for a third term, but I think anyone can see the validity in your argument.  You stated very well your thoughts on the trustworthiness of Clinton.  Furthermore, I agree with you that Clinton may have been the worse of two evils.  However, as i stated in my discussion, I believe that Clinton may have affected a different generation than Nixon did.  This is because of the actual experience that eh younger generation had with the Clinton Scandal.  Also, Clinton came into office with a bad reputation for not keeping his pants up.  So many Americans shoudl not have been surprised as much as they were that he could have done this.  I guess many Americans dismissed the early Clinton allegations because of the source.  After all, Paula was not the prettiest thing.

===message:I think that your answer is very shallow.  The political arena is very much say what needs to be said for the support of colleagues and votes.  Polliticians have an out because they tend to have enough people that will go along with them.  You missed the fact that Watergate was covered up by many not just the president.  Someone had to install and approve the instalation of the equipment.  To refer lying to your family to politics we don't really know what Bill Clinton told his family.  You have to realize that he could have had to take the lie road by advisement from his closest advisors.  Clinton situation was far more less than what Nixon did because Watergate went deep into the administration.  Nixon came from a covert mindset which made what he did natural.  But where I do agree with you is that yes Clinton would have probably won a 3rd term.

===message:If Clinton was influenced by his advisors to lie, then he chose to not to think and make his own decision about what he did.  This lack of personal obligation is not an excuse.  If anything, it is another reason why Clinton is worse off than Nixon.  At least Nixon made his own decisions; it is a shame that Nixon let others take more of the blame than he did.  Clinton dropped his own pants.  Did his advisors tell him to do that?

===message:I think everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and just because someone's opinion differs from your own does not make that opinion "shallow".  Clinton took marriage vows, an oath, a promise...most would say a very sacred promise.  He chose to cheat on his wife several times and therefore break that promise.  The oath of office is also an oath, a promise, a vow.  So why would he also not choose to break that promise?  I was saying that he had a propensity to break important promises for his own personal gain.  In the case of Monica Lewinsky, it was his weiner thinking for him.  I would say he lacked integrity.

===message:To James:  Why does Clinton owe us a personal obligation when it comes to his marriage and infidelity?  We are not married to him, Hilary is.  

To Kathryn:  Why does Clinton's vow, oath and promise of marriage have anything to do with his skills as a president?  Why is it our business?

Unfortunately, I believe it was a mistake in the first place for the incidents of infidelity to be made public, but that's the just how the media is.  Here's a question:  Had we not known about his frisky business, would you feel the same way about Mr. Clinton?  If not, do you then think it is possible to separate personal and presidential?

===message:His promises have a lot to do with his capability as president.  He was elected to represent us in Washington and keep our best interests ahead of his own.  He was elected based on a campaign of promises to the American people.  So if Clinton can't keep his promises to his wife, how is he going to keep his promises to us, the public?  Also, if he is self-serving and disregards the vows he took to his wife, how do we know he won't be self-serving and disregard the promises he made to the American people?

===message:When you go to apply for a job, does the interviewer ask you about your personal life?  No, and the reason is because it's not relevant to your ability to perform your job.  In fact, if they do ask, they are not asking legally.  Why doesn't Mr. Clinton deserve the same respect to privacy that the average American gets?

===message:I think you are missing the point.  Do you really realize the magnitude of what Nixon did?  He manipulated the entire government body and took the ship down.  Clinton morally messed up but he did not include the sacred body with him.  Not excusing what was done but Nixon shook the entire administration plus 1 innocent man trying to make a living with his deed.
