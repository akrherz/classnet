===message:An example of how the goverment is interfering in our life could be the beefed up security at the airport.  They stop you at least 2x but it can be up to 5 sometimes.  What is sad is not that they have all of a sudden changed things, but that they have only just started doing what they were supposed to be doing all along.

===message:I am a firm believer that 9/11 could have been prevented.  I think that Americans believed that we were isolated from that type of behavior.  The Airport is a perfect example of an inconvenience.  When I went to fly out to Raleigh, NC., I had my SUV searched (20 minutes), Line for Carry on luggage/Metal Detector (45 Minutes), Shoes and Body Search (45 Minutes), and the time of me being on a safe flight (priceless)

===message:I think that the reason that we never believed that an event like 9/11 could occur was because the only attacks on American soil have been American attacks.  If my memory serves me, every war we have engaged in, with the exception of the civil war, was on foreign soil.  We all took our safety for granted because we have never know any other way of life.  Maybe the CIA or FBI knew that we were vunerable, but as I said in another posting, I don't think that we could all sleep at night if we knew of every threat to our nation.  Had we been warned it might have helped, but the element of suprise always has a great advantage in warfare.  I don't think that warnings would have helped because most of us don't think like a terrorist.  We have learned a very painful lesson from 9/11 but I think the element of suprise is gone.
