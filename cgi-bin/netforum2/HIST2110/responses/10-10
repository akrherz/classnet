===message:You have some great points in your discussion.  In my thoughts the 1950's were the begining of a transition for working woman.  If we look back in history a woman's role was that of taking care of the home and children.  While men handled everything outside of the home.  You are correct there are alot more opportunities for woman in modern society.  I think this has to do with the change in thinking that has occured over the years.  It was normal for a woman to be a housewife back them and generally more accepted.  In today's world woman who choose to stay at home a far ournumbered by the working wives.  I think the divorce rate is impacted slightly by the "independent woman" but there are far to many other factors involved.  Now woman are more likely to leave their spouse because they feel and have every right to, that they can do things on there own.

===message:James,

I do not agree that the increase in the divorce rate is contributed to the independence of the "modern women."  I believe the rise in the divorce rate is contributed to other factors such as lack of communication, financial pressures, domestic violence, alcoholism, and work stress leaving less time for family.  I also believe most men today appreciate the independence of the "modern women."  Such a woman becomes a helpmate, not a dependant, within the marriage.

===message:Thank you for your reply.  I do feel that the divorce rate of America has increased for several reasons.  To put on reason onto the situation would be limiting and too judgemental.  But you did give a goo example.  Once again, thank you for helping make this a two way discussion

===message:Carla, thank you for your reply.  I also do not feel that the rise divorce can be attributed the independence of the "modern woman."  However, the independence of the "modern woman" has enabled women to get out of a situation (like the ones you mentioned, especially the lack of communication) that would necessitate a divorce.  Thank you again.
