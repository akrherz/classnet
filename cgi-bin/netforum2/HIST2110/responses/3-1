===message:There is one thing I have seen in several posts - "misuse of power" when describing the Anti-federalists point of view.  I agree with this, there was definitely reason to believe this would happen, considering the events that took place under the British government.  However, don’t we have (or have had) numerous politicians that have misused their power!  Hindsight is always 20/20; although, letting the states govern themselves would never gotten this country to where it is now.

===message:You stated that control of the government by elected officials could lead to tyrrany and abuse of power, but that risk occurs at all levels of government.  Elected state officials could have abused thier power in the same way.  Instead of one central government potentially abusing power, we could have started with 13 state governments abusing power.  Would that have made the abuses any less?  Abuse of power and tyrrany at any level is unacceptable, which is why the checks and balances were installed in the Constitution, to help minimize or eliminate the instances of abuse.
