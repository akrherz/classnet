===message:I agree with you.  I also feel that the policy of moderation was attempted and failed through President James Buchanan.  Buchanan sought to avoid controversy and disruption of the Union by his policy of popluar sovereignty, which only led to further controversies between the North and South.

===message:Perhaps if Buchanan had taken a stronger stand, be it pro or anitslavery, much of the dubious legislature would have been avoided that led to so much hostility between the north and south.  his mistake in supporting the Lecompton Constitution showed that he was acting out of the desire to keep the electoral votes from the south, and alienated him in the North.

===message:I agree with you that war was bound to happen.  The north and the south were concerned that their way of life was in jeopardy.  The South wanted to keep their easy life by retaining slaves, and the north feared that the expansion of slavery and its continuation threatened laborers' ability to find work.  However, your statement regarding the ability of a fanatic or a moderate to make a difference seems one sided.  You stated that if moderates ran the country, they "would have taken the role of the passive party that just wanted to please everyone."  How could they have pleased everyone?  The country was in a disagreement, thus not everyone would have been pleased by the moderates actions.  Could the moderates have made compromises?  Secondly, you stated that fanatics would have had a "my way or the highway" attitude.  You were correct here, however, you then went on to say that they would have saw their skin color as a way of gaining extra privileges.  I do agree that both your opinions of a moderate and a fanatic's method of control could have been like you said; yet I believe you left out the other side.  Could a fanatic not have been on the side of antislavery?

===message:I believe fanatics could have been on either side of the slavery debate.  There were those who felt so strongly that slavery was right that they wanted to stay an independent state, yet there were others how felt that there was no way that slavery could have been okay...they felt that people should not be subjected to living as animals.
