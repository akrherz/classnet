===message:I believe also that it would have been foolhearty to fight against the south without the goal of abolishing slavery.  However, when Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, did he do it with the goal of freeing slaves or because he felt that it was necessary to unify his political party and secure once again the nomination for president.  It may not be clear how much pressure his cabinet felt from Britain after the Trent Affair.  I would wager that his major reason for doing it was not because he felt that "it was the right thing to do."

===message:Chad, I agree with you about Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclomation.  I do not feel he did it to help free the slaves, I think he did it to achieve his political goals.

===message:The result of the Civil War brought many good things to the U.S.  Ending slavery, establishing a national banking system, and the promotion of large scale businesses were all advatngages.  I think that the greatest advantage of all of these was increasing federal powers.  Carla, I do dissagree with your comment about state's rights today though.  I feel like if states continued to increase their power, the United States would turn out like Europe--each state having their own laws and eventually becoming their own country.  That is why we are called the "United" States of America.

===message:Lincoln's issuing the Emancipation Proclamation was not geared towards freeing the slaves, it was to bring all states into line.  Slaves were to be freed in states that were in "rebellion" others were allowed to keep their slaves.  Lincoln did not abolish slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation he only used it as a measure to  bring states back into the Union.
