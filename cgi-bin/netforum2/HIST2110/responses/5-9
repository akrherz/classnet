===message:I totally agree.  I think the aftermath of the Civil War made the rest of the world realize that the U.S. deserved and demanded more respect than it was getting.

===message:<p> No doubt the Civil War created a "new nation". There are still alot of protagonist for the Confederacy's political ambitions walking around today. While I find myself agreeing on alot of issues, I have to disagree about the national banking system. I think it was the best thing Lincoln did for the country. A central currency standard does alot to help business and ecconomic growth. Alot of people claim that it is completely unconstitutional, but I would have favored a constitutional ammendment to pass it if necessary.</P>
<P>The bad hangover we still have after the Civil War is an overpowered federal government. It set the stage for men like FDR to completely rewrite the rules of the government with the Constitution as a suggestion rather than iron clad guidelines. When did the 10th ammendend get stricken? "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."</p>

===message:I agree to your assesment.  It is very hard to really judge wether it was good or bad due to the fall out of the events of that time.  Many still held on to thier views and exploitation of the war ran rapid. The new banking system allowed for nationwide acceptance of 1 currency that allowed for even more exploitation.  But overall I do agree it as if you cut off your nose to spite your face!
