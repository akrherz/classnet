===message:I agree with you on your answer.  Even though the war took many lives, there were some positive outcomes that resulted from it.  This country probably would be a different place if that war had not taken place.  Everything would probably be dysfunctional now.

===message:If the Civil War hadn't taken place when it did, the United States as we know it would have been divided into two separate countries.  Remember, several Southern states seceeded from the Union before the actual start of hostilities.  Had the Union simply let them go, they most likely would have formed their own country.  These nations may have ended up in war just a few years later, however, as they began to contest the western territories.  This would have led to a war similar to the one that was fought, only the dates would be different.
