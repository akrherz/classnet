===message:Kevin, I agree with you.  I think the movements were a long time coming and with such much frustration building up due to things not changing, there was no way for avoidance of violence.  The movements showed that each group no longer wanted the "white people" to interpret the importance and meaning of the cultural aspect of their society.

===message:I agree with both of you also.  I do not condone violence; however, I am not sure these groups would have gotten the recognition needed had the violence not occurred!

===message:Kevin, I agree with you.  I think what people are forgetting is how we came to be America.  America has been built on attempts to be nonviolent which turns to violence which if nothing else get attention quick.  YOu are very right you got to do what you got to do sometimes to get half of your share.

===message:I agree; it was not always the minority being violent. They were the people who were getting beat, sprayed down with the hose, and being attack by dogs, but still consider violent. But, there were times that they were not violent doing these events because it was a nonviolence event.
