===message:Great answer!
Your answer to question number 1 was very interesting, I believe you and I saw the British as very cunning, manipulative and somewhat deceitful the overall scheme of things.  The British government on many occassions were very reactive opposed to proactive in their decison making.  This type of anequated reasoning can often time cause confusion and misunderstanding among those persons "ont the outside looking in."

===message:After reading the sections in the chapter and reviewing the information brought forth by class mates, I have been pondering over who was right and who wasnt.  While reading the chapters, I came to the conclusin that one while the Brits were right in the their anger towards Americans because they didnt have to pay for their war, however the Americans had valid points also considering Pitt made this particular agreement.  All in all I thought it was rather childish to go to war over something like that!  Small things lead to the bigger things that ultimately caused even more hatred towards the colonies and Brits!

===message:Thank you.  The British were very cunning, however, so were the Americans.  The Americans used their own form of propaganda to promote the division between America and Britain.  As I mentioned, Samuel Adams had his own portrayal of the actions by the British soldiers.  These actions were false or sometimes misrepresented, thus leading other Americans to believe the British had no sense of moral justice.  Furthermore, the retaliations of the Americans towards some of the British actions against them were far from promoting a peaceful compromise.
