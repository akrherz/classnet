===message:I would not say the the educational facilities reinforced sex roles by teaching "home-economics" and typing because those same courses are taught in colleges and universities across America today. Women have always had a choice in their education--now and in the 1950s. It is still my choice to get a degree in Office Technology or Law. The choice is mines now, and it was theirs (womens) then. Again, I think society made typing, sewing, and teaching more admirable for women to choose than today.
