===message:I agree with your statement about women being happy with their roles in the 50's.  Who's to say who was better off?  Obviously, we feel we are better off today because of our opportunities, like you pointed out.  The women then probably felt better off than women in their past because of the "happy" home atmosphere. Of course, they did not realize that such liberation could exist for them as we have now, so they were ignorant to the possibilities.  Ignorance is bliss, right? :)

===message:Great job!  I just wanted to make a comment on one point.  You stated that from what you read, that it seemed like women wanted the life they had in the 50's and that they were happy with it.  I don't think that all women were happy with that life and I think some may have wanted different, but during that time, society was controlled by men and they must have felt as if they had no other choice and that they were expected to stay at home.  They must have felt it was wrong to go against the rest of society as well as what it expected of them.  A good point that you made was that today, women don't have to have a man to get what they want, which is true.  Women don't have to be dependent upon a man for money and can make their own money, and receive their own education and so forth.
