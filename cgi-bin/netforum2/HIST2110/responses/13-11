===message:Americans’ being tired of the unrest that had gripped the nation for so many years is a good reason that many Americans ad grown tired.  You statement about Americans always being better off today than they were yesterday may be a bit too broad, but I understand that many changes in technology and the way people see other people have changed.  Technology has led to the extension of life well beyond what was expected fifty years ago.  Furthermore, technology has led he way to link many people together promoting unity and helping to secure ties.  Morals are on the decline, but this is partly because of family life.  The invention of televisio and video games could play a major role in the breakdown of families, and thus explain the change in family values.  I think government may not affect family life in the sense that it could change the values of the family members in it.  Although, many politicians and other leaders and role models set a negative example for many of America’s youth, something that should be changed.

===message:No I disagree we were not concerned with the unrest of the 60's 70's. Reagonomics was a period of its own.  It was a new problem that plagued a new generation.  Civil rights should be a concern of all generations.  If you notice all races now feel that they are discriminated against for one rason or another.  As it pertains to Morals it starts at home.  We can,t evaluate morals of a few politicians determine our view of morals overall.  I feel that the average persons has good morals and good way of life.

===message:True, civil rights is a concern of all generations.  And it is true that all races feel they are discriminated against in one way or another.  However, I think that civil rights issues are not as pressing now as they were in the 1960s.  I don't think discrimination will ever be totally eliminated, but I do believe that it is lessening.  Yes, Reagonomics was a period of its own but it did not exist in a vacuum.  There were many factors during this time that contributed to the feeling of apathy that existed in the American people and I am sure that the unrest of the previous two decades played some part in that.

===message:I do agree that morals are individual family matters.  It seems that people are less apt to take offense to bad behavior now.  It could be based partly on policially correctness.  People are now so worried that they have to be PC that we are more accepting of behavior that would have been considered taboo in the past.  Our society has become one that feels we have to accept every way of life, that it seems are morals are slipping.  One person's idea of high moral values has become another persons idea of the victorian era.  Times change as does the composition of our country.
