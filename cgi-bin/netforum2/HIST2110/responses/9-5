===message:Chris, I agree with you that the "population is not in a complete panic and fright of foreign terrorism" but the poplulation does have fear and now seems to keep its eyes and ears open and ready to report any activities out of the ordinary.  For example, for our safety no less, the state and local police who in the past would drive by an abandon car on the highway, are directed to be more alert and stop and check out all abandon vehicles.

===message:I agree with both of you!  The new precautions of the state and local police are gravely overdue.  I also did not by duct tape and plastic, I fear more for the welfare of my two year old in a new daycare than a terrorist attack! The best advise I have been given was to live my life as usual, keep up with world events as I have not much choice, and be happy with what I am blessed with!

===message:What I meant was not that there is no fear, just that there is not enough fear to lead to repression of dissidents. Look at all the war protests we've seen. Imagine how many of those people would be in jail if they were demonstrating against McArthyism in the 50's. I was just pointing out that the climate is nothing like the 50's and the question made a bad comparison.

===message:I agree that our degree of panic today is not that of our history.  I do not believe that were are as easily influenced today due in part to our access to public documents and records.  The internet has made it easier for the American public to access international information and to form ideas of ourselves.  Although there is information that we are not privy to, it is harder to outright lie about particular events.
