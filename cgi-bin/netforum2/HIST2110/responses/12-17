===message:You made some great points Johnetta.  My favorite in particular being that it's hard to gain the people's trust once there has been corruption in the system.  People no longer feel as if the government is working for the best interests of America, and that trust cannot hardly be regained.  As you said Johnetta, the people in the political system are there to serve and protect, as well as set an example.  In the Clinton scandal and the Nixon scandal, two bad examples were set which will forever put a lack of trust in the minds of the people.  It is sad that we don't feel like our own government is governing for our best interests, instead we feel they are secretive and not trustworthy.  Yet, these feelings developed from scandalous activities of those who are supposed to be "leaders."

===message:I dont agree with your assesment.  I dont think its the system that we dont trust.  You have to realize that Watergate was about the bugging of the Democratice Party.  Not about changing policy so the system was still in tact.  We truly learned that the Presidency is not above reproach.
