===message:I think the failure in Reconstruction could have been that everyone wanted to get back at someone else.  President Johnson wanted to get back at the elite plantation owners, the Radical Republicans wanted to get back at President Johnson and the total South, and the South wanted to get back at the Slaves for being freed.  Was this the driving force that our country was built on?  It makes me wonder!

===message:I can agree with that because its a lot of that going in our history. Everybody want to get back at the man because of one reason or another. The VETO of this bill as many times as it appeared is just another example of America pushing yet another issues that it don't want to deal with.
