===message:i would have to disagree.  i believe that the federalist acted rather selflessly.  it is well documented that many of them were wealthy, but look what they did.  they created a government that is optimal in representing the people.  try and find a more representational government in the world, or a society that protects the rights of the minorities.  it cannot be done.  i do not think that antifederalists were all "ordinary" people either.  i think that the paper said that only 1/4 of the voting population  voted and i think that most anitfederalists were those that oppposed unification, but would have rather had strong state governments and a weak national government.  history shows that that did not work (Articles of Confederation).

===message:Connie, I agree with most of what you are saying.  I am not sure if all Anti-Federalist were the common man, but I do think that the events of the past weighed heavily on their reluctance to trust the balance promised by the Constitution.  On the one hand the Federalist were branching out into new territory because the current system(Articles of Confederation) were not working.  On the other hand, there were not guarantees.  One problem is that the Constitution is so open to interpretation, there was not the assurance needed to calm the fears of the Anti-Federalist.  Obviously the Federalist had more money and politial power than the Anti-Federalist, but I think that if the issue had been further researched by the Anti-Federalist, they may have won more people over.

===message:
   <P>The danger the ant-federalists saw was the subjigation of the, up until that point in time, independent and self governing states under a government that could be manipulated by heavily populated states. I think that their fears came to fruition in the period approaching the Civil War and ensuing period of Northern occupation. One of the many devices that lead to the secession of the South was heavy tariffs on Southern trade forced by the North. The Federal government used funds from these tariffs to finance transportation (railroads, canals, ect) and other infrastructure in the North.</P>
<P>What you have to put in your mind in the state of the Union (or non-union if you prefer). The states were supreme and the Constitution took that supremecy away. Imagine if the United Nations drew up a resolution to impose itself as the supreme law of this nation as well as others. I don't think it would sit well with most Americans. While this is not a perfect anology, it might put the Anti-federalist opinion into perspective</p>

===message:I agree in part with both remarks, somewhat, but the part about who were the Antifederalist, I recall the prominence of Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee,George Mason,and future president James Monroe. I am sure there were many others not named. The americans coming together for one common cause, under one government was the goalof the Federalist. The Antifederalist request ratification of the Constitution, to include the Bill Of Rights, protecting Americans basic freedoms, was an item that ensured solidarity of the nation.

===message:You made some very valid points, however I do disagree on one point that you made in that despotism was what both the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists feared, remember they were all on the same side during in the Revolution.  I believe that in the Federalists eyes they did not want another version of Parlimant and a government that had absolute power and authority but wanted order.  With each State being sovereign there would be no consistancy, uninformity, or fairness in the New World and that would have ultimately led to tyranny, disorder and mayhem.  I believe that by implementing the checks and balances in order to keep any one government entity from having absolute power, the Federalists revealed that there was not to establish another monarchy, but to establish a central government that would provide uniform and fair (fair to some anyway) representation to everyone.

===message:I agree as well!! The Antifederalists were just very cautious about the power the government officials had.  I mean who could blame them.  After what they encountered from the British, I would have been cautious, frightened, and suspicious about the Federalist’s use of the same government tactics as the British had.  On the other hand, I can sympathize with the Federalists approach as well.  They wanted a strong government, one that could be controlled without loopholes as well as equality among men.  We as a nation had just went through many obstacles with the British to win back our independence, therefore the Federalists created the strong government to prevent any attempt by the British to invade the Americas.  Personally, I would have been a Federalist because I am a strong believer that you have to be decisive in order to pursue your goals.  Just get up and do it, don’t complain nor be scared of change.  Change is a good thing.

===message:I do agree that change can be a good thing, but sometimes it can be too scary to accept.  The Federalists had good intentions and were on the right track, yet if they had not had good intentions and were trying to make changes to benefit only a few it could have been very harmful for the country.  The Federalists were visionaries and eventually it became clear that they were uniting the states.
