===message:Kevin, what is a pee contest and how does it apply to the two super powers of the world?  I agree with your post, but how can you say that Georgia does not receive its fair share of snow fall?  I live in Clayton County, and I get at least a 1/32 of and inch of snow a year.  So when I rush to the grocery store/Home Depot, the purchase of milk, bread, eggs, and generator is all NECESSARY!

===message:A "pee contest" is any sort of competition between two or more individuals or groups in which the main objective is to out do the other.  I am sorry to say that your annual snow fall percentage does not make it neccessary for you to purchase all the groceries.  The Northeast had a 27 inch snowstorm last month.  I think that should be the standard for all of the gatherers of all the milk and bread.
