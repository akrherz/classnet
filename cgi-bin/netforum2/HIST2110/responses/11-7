===message:I agree with you a little but to be honest I think they were fighting for the rights that the constitution and bill of rights promised them as citizens.  Though many of them had to use thier heritage to get the attention I really think if given the choice many would have preffered equality based on the laws not on who they were.

===message:I do feel that some of the movements were more divisive than helpful.  A good example being the "Black Power" movement.  Resorting to violence did nothing to get their point across execpt anger the one's who were oppressing them.  It showed that they were trying to divide themselves from the white man instead of unite, which should have been the goal.  Yet, it takes both sides, the white man, and the minority groups to want to unite in order for there to be unity and peace.
