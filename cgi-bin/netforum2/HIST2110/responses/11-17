===message:I thought that what you said was on point.  I wish I had organized my thoughts in the manner that you did when I posted my discussion.  I agree with you on the impact that these movements had.  I feel that the main impact that these movements had in common was the coordination of a political voice.  I also thought that your examples of he organizations that formed out of these movements were great as well.
