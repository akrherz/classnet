===message:I too share the same opinion as you.  I also believe that the bloodshed is not something to be grateful for, but the uniting of the nation is.  It is just so messed up how something so awful had to occur in order to cause the nation to become a better place.

===message:I agree, the war was needed even though the cost was a sad one. This war brought us together and showed us that the only way that we will be able to move forward is to let go of such issues as slavery.

===message:it also makes you wonder, exactly what the turning point will be in the future, that will revolutionize the similar crisis that we have today with our modern day slavery. i would see the unfair below minimal wage labor provided to a large percentage of mexican immigrants to be slavery as well. and what would the country do without these hard working people. the country would again panic and suffer as did proceeding the war.

===message:The civil war was like a very dramatic version of a fight between sibilings.  I know that my sister and I had small fights growing up, but in our late teens we had one huge blow up over a small issue that had been festering between us.  The fight lasted about a week and almost drove our parents out of the house but when it was over we were the best of friends and have always supported each other.  We both learned lessons from our fight and we grew as people.  Our nation learned many lessons from our internal fight and grew into a strong country.

===message:I keep reviewing the idea that issues this grave could be resolved peacefully. I can't figure out how that could have happened and still resulted in emancipation for slaves. Any ideas? I keep thinking that if I could just picture a solution to that, I might come up with some answers for the mess our country is in today.

===message:
With or with out the war slavery would have ended. I think slavery would end even with no change in basic attitude on the part of pro-slavery Americans, toward slavery I mean. The reason is pure economics. By the 1860’s the rest of the “modern” world had abandoned slavery and found it to be unsavory. The economic pressure and probable trade sanctions brought on the US by the rest of the world would have forced a change. We are a capitalist nation and the planters were also capitalist. They did not keep slaves for entertainment but because they were profitable. As technology marched forward machines would have become more profitable than slaves, who have to be feed sheltered and clothed.  This may not be the most compassionate scenario but I don’t think that it is too far off the mark. Of course I would hope that a change of heart would have happened on the part of the planters.
