===message:<p>I seriously doubt Lincoln or any president could have made black sufferage work without creating such a huge divide between North and South that Union may not have held. Judging from Lincoln's record on handling race issues and some other reading's I have looked at on Lincoln, I don't think he would have actively enforce blakc sufferage. The transport of former slaves to Liberia was his brainchild, even though it proved so costly and unpopular it failed.</P>
<p>Although there were alot of politicians that had a progressive view on race in the North, I think that the majority of populace viewed race relations as Southern problem that didn't concern them. I think racial equality was liberal view whos time had not yet come. The vast majority of the black population was illiterate and uneducated. I think the Northern politicians had a false perception that a generation of education and land reform would solve all racial inequality. It ended up taking generations for the black populace to rise out of the status of a semi-permanent underclass.</p>
<p> I think everyone can agree that Johnson was a poor president and a political failure, but I think the main diference between him and other candidates is that they wouldn't have commited political suicide.</P>

===message:I agree with your opinions.  It was apparent that Johnson had ulterior motives then what he painted for voters in the beginning.  The thing is, if they would have done away with segregation from the start, and then there would have been an uprising in the South.  The South was already in an uproar about losing the War.  There was already a lot of hatred towards the Freedmen.  Imagine if the Freedmen were granted the planters land and more freedoms than the ex-Confederates.  It was a rough time to live in.  There was no happy medium that would suffice the public.  The South focused hatred on Freedmen (aka - KKK).  It would have been the rekindling of another war if it had been 100% desegregation from the beginning.  I wish that it could have been that way.  But, considering that the US just ended a Civil war, nobody wanted to start another one.  When the war ended, people mainly focused on making money.

===message:Reconstruction failed more than it succeeded because most of the goals set for it were not even close to being achieved.  The Radical Republicans envisioned a slower readmission process that would exclude more ex-conferales form the politcal life.   They were strongly apposed to the polices of President Andrew Johnson.  But believed that freed slaves should have complete equality with white citizens.   They were considered radical because they were a very critical group of people.
