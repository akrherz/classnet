===message:I agree with you Ursula.  I would have had concerns if I were an anti-federalist about giving that power over to the rich.  It would impede upon my rights as an individual citizen.  I would have had a problem with it knowing that more power was given to the national government and not the individual states.  It would make me feel a lot less powerless as a citizen.  So I would agree in saying that I would have been an anti-federalist.
