===message:I think that both sides believed they were right. The British thought that they had the authority to continue their rule over the British subjects although they were in a new land.  The new Americans believed that they had a right to govern themselves since they had no representation in the British government.  Neither side was completely "right" but could likely have forged a compromise that would have been favorable to all if the British hadn't imposed so many taxes on the new colonists.
