===message:I agree that if two sides could come to an agreement that armed attacks against each other could be prevented providing that both sides stick to the agreement.  We are at war today because the security of the american people are at risk by someone who is unwilling to adhere to polices.

===message:I agree to disagree because I feel that we are because the President want a personal gain out of the situation. I do agree that Japan was being underhanded and sly and the attack on Pearl Harbor was not needed. This was a total power struggle that both bulled sides could not back down for their own personal gain. Sometimes your pride will you eating out of the garbage can.
