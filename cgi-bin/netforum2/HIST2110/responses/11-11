===message:i would say that in certain cities minorities constitute the majority already.  i was raised in southern california and it seems to me that the mexican-american population is quickly growing.  whether or not they are all legal citizens is always a question but they definitely have a strong voice in politics out there.  however, i do not believe that these movements will have any effect on this change in minority status.  let me ask you.  do you mean in terms of population or in terms of representatives in government?  if you mean government then, yes, perhaps these movements will have had an effect.  however, i mean the early beliefs of the movements, not the mobilization of violent opposition to the majorities.  another good question: once they do become the majority (let's assume that they do) will they make a society of equality or will they become the oppressors that they faught against?  it makes me think of George Orwell's Animal Farm.

===message:I think that eventually the majority and minority may eventually blend into one.  Lines of race and culture are already blurred in many aspects.  There will always be those who marry within their ethnic beliefs, but the majority of our culture marries based on love, common interests and goals.  Most large cities are very diverse in their population, including their governing officials.

===message:well you know there is greed and selfishness that will forever prevail in our world. so i'm sure that there are some potential oppressors of the new majority. however i feel that ultimately this will not become a major problem. the attitudes of the growing majority of people are so liberated and open minded today, that i think the new majority will benefit our nation.
