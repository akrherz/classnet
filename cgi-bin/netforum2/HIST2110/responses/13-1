===message:Awesome point, Robert.  I agree that each president contributed in good and bad ways.  Some were better or worse than others overall, but in retrospect, all of them were superior to some other countries' leaders (Hitler!).

===message:Your post reminded me of something my father once said. "Kevin, buy real estate, cause God ain't making any more of it." I too believe that it is hard for americans and the president to see fault with the decisions they make at the time.  Its the true evil of hindsight bias!

===message:Robert, I agree with you regarding the political climate,the heightened environmental consciousness and physical well- being. Those were the positive things that took place during the Reagan era. As far as presidents' responsibilities are concern,If we vote to put the best candidate in office to guide,lead,and protect the interest of all the people of this country,then why not expect the best.Not everyone is president material,that is why so many are on the sidelines.And yes, we have the right to be critical about decision that affect our lives.I hope we are getting better in our choices when it comes to choosing reputable political representatives.Are we better off today, remains to be seen after the current situations is resolved.

===message:Robert,

I agree with you and feel we also need to remember that every individual elected to President is imperfect but believes his views and solutions are for the benefit of all.  In all cases, there will be errors and mistakes.  Some problems will be solved or patched, while others are created at the same time.
