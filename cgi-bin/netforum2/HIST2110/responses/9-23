===message:Those were good points.  I wonder in places like Israel if the people become desensitized to all of the horror and the "preparedness."  I also wonder if we continue to get these warnings without anything really happening, that the American people will one day not heed the warnings and be caught unprepared.  But that was a good point about us feeling very secure with our borders and overreacting when someone threatens our interests

===message:Chad that is a good question. I believe that Americans in general have very short memories and getr bored quickly. If these warnings persist for long after this war is over we as a people will start to ignore them.  Then after a while the warnings  will just fade away until the next big incident.
