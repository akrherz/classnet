===message:Reconstruction wasn't a complete failure and military force would have devastated the country and set it further behind. Reconstruction brought the country back as one and readmitted the southern states. Although , reconstruction created admendments for the Freedmans, it did not completly bring the black man and woman to equality. The radical republicans caused further problems for the country, by their policies and with them attempting to exact those polices quickly.

===message:Reconstruction was a success in one sense, which was again, to reunite the nation. Equality on the other hand, for blacks, was not achieved. The radical republicans tried very hard to make this conquest a reality.

===message:I don't believe that Reconstruction was a total failure.  There were also some good things that came from it.  You're right when you said the Radical Republicans were "ready to get things on the ball and jumping."  They did seem like they were very impatient and if someone got in their way they were ready to knock them down.

===message:I agree with you that it seemed to be a failure, but I am not sure that anything could have reconstructed a nation that was so torn.  The south did not agree with the beleifs of the north and the country was too wounded to enforce the laws on the south.

===message:I believe that Reconstruction was a failure because the rights of freedmen were forgotten.  If politicians would have practiced what they preached, military force to enforce blacks's rights, then real progress would have been made.

===message:Reconstruction wasn't a complete failure.  When you go through a war and fight for what you have been doing since the beginning of time, then a complete change is not expected immediately.  The South tried to get around any laws and amendments any way they could.  On the state level is where it was the worst.  They make their own rules conrcerning their own state.  I believe the Radical Republicans were very 'radical' in the way they were very closed minded to other opinions.  It was their way or the highway.
