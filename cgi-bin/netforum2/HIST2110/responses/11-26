===message:In addition to being more radical, the Black Power movement was also more militant at times.  The Black Power movement was more prone to act violently and lash out at whites and authorities than the Red or Brown Power Movements.

===message:The Black Power movement did act more violently in situation then the other two movements.  But, the majority of white people had extreme prejudice against African Americans.  The cops would often times harass African Americans.  Some (if not most) situations were just as much the other parties fault then Black Power movements.  The Black Power movement had to deal with more hatred than the other two movements.
