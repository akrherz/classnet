===message:I totally agree with Kevin, both sides were too passionate about what they beleived in.  The philosophies employed by both parties involved completed divided the nation and in some instances cause confusion amongst each other. Clearly the government needed to make a decision in order to eliminate chaos.  A decision that would allow for clear and concise development of enforceable policies.

===message:I completely agree.  I truly believe there is no way the nation could have functioned peacefully with half the people being anti-slavery and half the people being pro-slavery.  The government making a positive declaration on one or the other for the entire nation seemed to be the only way to resolve the conflict quickly.  Each state had it's own representatives and the reps should have had a congressional meeting to decide the issue.  Of course, as easy as that may sound, it seems war would still be inevitable.

===message:I completely agree because both the north and the south were passionate and had their reasons for what they believed. The issue would not have been solved without a resolution from the goverment.  You made a good point saying that there is no middle ground and that the government's declaration of free-soil or slave, would have to be decided to help end the conflict.
