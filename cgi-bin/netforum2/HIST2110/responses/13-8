===message:I disagree I do feel that we are better off today than 20 years ago because we have come a long way and yes we still have a long way to go. I look at it as positive reinforcement, give the praise for us as a people that have come together as one, give the praise to men that look at women as their equal, give the praise to those that don't look at the color of the skin and I could go on because we hear enough of the bad every time we turn on the TV or radio so some times you have to focus on sometime that is positive because if you don't you will never see the progress and get down in all this negativity.
