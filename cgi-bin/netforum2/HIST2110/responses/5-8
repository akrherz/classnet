===message:I am in total aggreement with you on this issue the benefits that resulted from the civil war far out weigh the negative consequences.  The war basically laid the framework for society as we know it today.  A numbers of the things we take forgranted in our every day lives were paid for by the Civil War.  National banking system, trans continental railroads, major industrial resources, civil rights for both blacks and women.  Aside from abolishing slavery I feel one major benefit was the weakening of the states rights, and the establishment of a strong national government.  Just imagine how life would be without the federal government to provide structure, protection and accountability.  We would probably live in a constant state of war.  Oklahoma is fighting with Kansas, Texas is a war with Californina etc.  Give a thought to the economy, how would we as a nation establish anything if each state were coining it's own money runing a totally seperte banking system than the neighboring state.  How would our economy survive, it would probably open the door for (just an example) another country to take over the U.S. we could all be speaking german or russian right now.

===message:Thank you Mr. Tyler for your response.  I agree with you.  The hostilities that could have developed between the states would have definately weakened the security and structure of America.  Furthermore, your statements that you made about the Civil War paving the way for many changes that accured in our society were very substantial.  The Civil War reflected a growing change in the ideology of Americans.  Through the support and the political smarts of Lincoln, the Emancipation Proclamation made a statement about this changing ideology.  Thank you agian for your response; you had some intersesting and intelligent remarks.  I hope that you will continue the discussion with me.  THank you. Sorry, if there are any grammar errors.  I, unfortunately, am in a hurrry.

===message:Unless I misread, Mr. Tyler is incorrect in one statement about civil rights between blacks and women.  Women gained a few civil rights, only because the men were sent off to war, but women did not gain the equality that seemed to be deserved by their support of the armies (medically) and the fact they were thrust into the work force.  Blacks were given a deserved freedom (although not as much as is should have been) but women were still considered "domestic" to say the least.
