===message:In regards to 9/11, I also believe that someone knew about Bin Laden before the attacks and that the government does not give us as much information as it did in the past.  Therefore, a lot of people today don't trust in the government because we know that they only give us information that they want us to know and we know that so much goes on without the American people knowing.  Today, there is a huge lack of trust in the government and therefore, it would be much more difficult to repress or control the American people.  Sadly,today,  a lot of people see the government as an enemy more than as a friend.
