===message:I don't think that Bush is trying to make up for Reagan years alone because Reagan was not the first President and from the beginning none of them were perfect so I feel that it is a combination all previous President, some more than others, that contributed to where American issues stands today.

===message:I agree in part of your assesment of the 70's and 90's but as they inherited it they really did nothing to sustain or decrease it.  A lot of people would love to blame 911 on the economy now but I personally feel that it is a scapegoat for political gain.  It works and I would use it too.  We did just approve a 75 billion defense budget and it doesnt seem to end thier.  We are better off than 20 years ago but we are falling fast.

===message:I agree that it seems that our financial picture looks bleak, but I don't feel it is any different than other periods of our history.  There is alway a situation that calls for more spending and we must find ways to finance them.  The point is, we should not panic and feel all is bleak...we always bounce back.

===message:yes i feel that the 911 attacks was purely beaurocracy. the media only portrayed that someone hit us hard and caused the american people to respond with anger and vindicative notions. we didn't really see the underlying issues that were being covered up.
