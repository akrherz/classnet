===message:Hannah,It does not matter if you are famous or not to be on the Blacklist. If you think different from what the American democracy would have you think then you are a trouble maker, communist,or whatever title that may be placed on you.One can be intimidated by their own peers let along the government.FEAR will make people do strange things to one another.
