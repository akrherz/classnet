<p>I believe that men and women are different in more than just gender. We develop with huge variances in hormones, which causes diferent physchological and physiological development. There are women in the workforce who measure up perfectly to their male counterparts, and there are men that make good "Mr. Moms", however this is not the norm. I think women, in general, are naturaly more suited to raising children than men. </p>
<p>I think women should be free to chose what they want to do, but as a mother, being and actual mother is definitely the best choice. I can't see anything that can make a bigger impact than influencing the next generation in a way of your choosing. I also think most "career moms" aren't happy at all. They are working because they have to, not because they want to. </p>
<p> In the beginning, I said this was going to be sexist. I don't think it's exactly sexist. There are definitely sex roles that society has given us. Not all of them are right, but most of them are based on an underlying fact or reason. Women are better nurturers than men, which puts them in a natural spot of being the primary care givers to children. My wife exudes a patience that I can only marvel at.</p>
<p> I think it's right for women to have a choice with how they lead their lives, just like men. However, I also think that in a family unit a woman belongs with children. So on one hand, society is a better place for women today because they would not looked down on for forsaking children to further a career. On the other hand, today's society is worse for women (and the family) because the choice of a mother to stay at home has been taken away for most of the middle and lower class. When a family is in the sub 25k income region they pretty much pay no income tax, but they are nailed with a 15% payroll tax that pays for social welfare programs. Once they get over the hump and start making a comfortable income after the 15% hit, they are on teh federal income  tax rolls. Then they have to work to get ahead of income tax (which gets higher as the income rises). It's a vicious cycle that forces women with children into the workforce, alot of times at menial jobs where there is no real advancement. They never view their careers as important, because they are only working to make ends meet. So we get a generation of children raised by schools and daycares.</p>
<p>Were women better off then or today? I think it realy depends on your perspective and priorities. As a man, I'm sure it looks different to me than it does to a woman.</P>

===message:While I agree that the majority of women are more natural nuturers for children and should be the primary care giver in most instances (not all instances; let's not forget the Susan Smith's of the world!), I do not necessarily agree that in order to effectively raise a child a mother's place is in the home.  From my own experience, my mother went to work after I began pre-school and still works to this day (I am 23).  I feel like she did a wonderful job raising me (and my Dad, too!!!) and do not feel that I could have benefitted any greater had she been a stay-at-home Mom.  Just from my own personal experience, I must say that I do not think ALL women should stay home with their children.  Also, just a personal opinion, but children who stay home and do not get to experience pre-school or day care may lack the abilities to work and play with other children.  After all, being home with an adult all day can't be as beneficial as everyone may think.  Social skills develop just as early as motor skills. Just my thoughts!!

===message:Chris,

I appreciate your candour and opinion on this matter.  While I agree that men and women are different and women should be feel to chose what they want to do, I do think, howver, that most women who stay at home are not happy at all.  In fact, it is quite boring to some - the same routine every day and in some cases without any adult interaction or conversation.  Whether a woman decides to work or not, it doesn't change the fact that she is also a "mother."  And let us not forget about the children.  Although men may view children training as chiefly women's work, it is a joint responsibility.  Both parents are to be an example, companion, communicator, and teacher to their children.  Quality time between a father and child is just as important as with a mother and child.  More importantly, we must remember that just because a female has a child, it doesn't necessarily mean she will also be a "good mother."

===message:Chris, i loved your opinion. it doesn't sound sexist coming from you because you deciphered your piece. i agree that "most" women do possess more patience and a certain nuturing ability than men. however, sometimes when i lack nurture my fiance compensates for it and vise versa. if my 4 year old barely falls, or runs into something but cries like he's been hit my an 18 wheeler, i may be the one to act like he needs to suck it up because i don't want him to be whimpy in this society. however if he's crying because he touched a hot stove....i know this brings pain, so i will hold and console him until he's better assuring him that he will be okay. my husband will feel that he's being overdramatic when the crying persists. so it goes both ways. however i agree with you because ultimately i have 0 tolerance with maltreatment of my children, which is why they are home with me now. pay someone to care for your child and risk mistreatment....i think not!!! as a MAN my husband has to work to feel like a MAN, however he knows that if i want to work i will work and he could never tell me not to work. it simply makes sense right now for me not to work. and i actually feel like a woman being home with the boys. however before the children as a working woman i felt like a woman to be working. i feel like a woman so long as i am being productive. and raising kids, to little men at that, and school is truely productive in my eye. the hardest job ANYONE, man or woman could ever have.
