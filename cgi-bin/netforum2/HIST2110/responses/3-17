===message:I agree,the Federalist idea of government covered open concerns and issues that eliminate most doubts.I think the American people wanted a strong,but fair form of governing powers. The Federalist wanted all the states to contribute and be apart of forming of the Constitution. During that time some elite political heads was not sure a national government was the answer to bring the people together.They wanted change to prevent despoticism,but also want to continue to have independent control of own state affairs.
After many months thrashing out problems regarding how the government was going to be established it was the Federalist ideas that met the needs of all concerns.

===message:(please forgive this response if it isnt that in depth!  My first response was erased from ClassNet for some odd reason)I think I would have to vote as a Federalist.  Being anti seems to be in favor in state elected officals controlling things.  Considering there are so many self rightous people Im not sure I would trust my life in their hands.  In modern day context it seems we are experienceing a bit of the anit federalist movements...so many politicians are doing things their way instead of what's best for the people.  Even though we ended up with the Federalist government I can not help but think some of the anti views have followed through time and run our current political system.  Considering there has not be a VOTE on WW3 in America and our "government officals" are calling all the shots wouldnt that be some of the antifederalist views stepping forth on a wider scale?  I just think that back in those times a Federalist government was the best option.

===message:If I had to pick, I would be a Federalist. I know that many of the states were small and could not represent themselves in times of war.  I feel like that the Constitution is very fair and promotes equality not supremacy.  I also know that the people who drafted the Constitution have done many researching and evaluatiing to come up with such a great idea.  But, I have to say that I am partial b/c I, along with everyone else in this history class, know that it worked--It is still here today.

===message:I probably would have been a Federalist too, but I liked the fact that the Antifederalists were there with a voice of opposition at the very beginning of our government. I think we'll all be okay as long as somebody's disagreeing loudly somewhere in America.
