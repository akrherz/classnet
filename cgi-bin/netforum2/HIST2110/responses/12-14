===message:I would have to disagree that Lewisnkygate was more detrimental to a president.  You mentioned all of the press that the Clinton scandal received.  Who among us was still excited to see the reports on the news about the scandal after the first week.  and after it droned on and on for months i was sick of hearing about it.  i couldn't care less what happened as long as it left the news.  after it was all over i had little trust for Clinton as a person but not necessarily as a politician.  his misdeed was a personal thing whereas Nixon had used the government to get even with people and even spy on his opponents.  this affected more people than just himself.  this is why i think his error was worse.

===message:Thier is no way you can truly feel that the Clinton scandal is more important than WaterGate.  Water Gate went deep into the political structure.  Clinton did not manipulate the FBI or the CIA.  The countries confidence was not damaged in the political structure it was in the man.

===message:Again, I think that both acts were detrimental to the President. I strongly believe that society would have been a little bit more prepared for another scandal like Nixon than a President having an affair, and getting caught. Morally, he let a great deal of people down.

===message:I'm afraid I have to agree with Chad and Al....Clinton's lie was a small measure of Nixon's!  Besides, several presidents have had affairs (JFK, anyone?!?), so to say that we could be 'prepared' for another Nixon as opposed to another Clinton is, I think, way off.

===message:But truly I think you are letting your personal issues with what Clinton did clould the magnitude of what NIxon did.  In the History of the Presidency has thier ever been a President that has caused his administration to crumble other than NIxon.  Even if Clinton would have got impeached his administration was still in tact.  Nixon whole cabinet pratically left or resighned because they were all guilty.  People went to jail over Nixon!
