===message:I disagree that these groups all "viewed violence as an acceptable method for accomplishing political goals."  Let's not forget Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Cesar Chavez.  Neither of these politically active men used violence in their attempts to accomplish their goals, but rather used religion.

===message:Great point, most of the political groups used some form of religion and/or political pressure to "have their message hear." Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and others stood tall for justice and the rights of those persons they felt were being mistreated. Their voices trumpeted throughout America and "rang" clearly the message of civil rights and humankind freedoms.  Most often these leaders did not used "obvious" forms of violence in their plights.  However much violence occured because of thier attempts to persuade the views of others.

===message:Chris, AIM was worthy,but so was the other civil issues even though some were advocates of violence. The fact remains that America was built on violence(stealing,lies,murder,rape,trickery,etc.)In order to get what they wanted at the expense of others(expansionist then and now). Remember what the colonist did to get their independence.I don't believe it is ok for some people to have rights,and others not to have the same rights. I believe in freedom, justice,and equality for all.

===message:<p>I re-read my post and can see where I was misunderstood. I didn't mean that the black civil rights movement was not legitimate. That would be a pretty ridiculous statement. What I disagreed with was violence used in movements for the accomplishment of political objectives. I set AIM aside from groups like the Black Panthers, because they were fighting for the right to exist as a people.</p>
<p>I don't think of King as a "black power" leader, although alot of the philosophy was spun around him and because of him and the civil rights movement. I think King represents what a people united for political gain can accomplish in America without the need to practice force and intimidation as a tactic. Even in the face of such tactics, their demonstrations and peaceful education of the American populace won out over brute force repression.</p>
<p>I disagree with Malcom X's and Nation of Islam's views of whites as devils and the need for blacks to be seperate from them. I find it ironic that one of the spin offs of the huge effort for desegregation of the country was huge black seperatist movement, which still remains powerfull today. One the other hand (I can't exactly remember the exact quote or phrase) but he said something to the effect that the biggest fight for black equality was in the black community. He called for men to be men and bear witness and responsibility for their househoulds and for communities to band together to rid themselves of parasitic criminal elements that perpetuated the cycle of crime, poverty and desperation pervasive in inner city communities. The man was smart and wasn't afraid to say things alot of people didn't want to hear if he believed in them. I think that is what lead to his death at the hands of Elijah Mohammed's men (never proven, but it coincided perfectly with a his nasty breakup with Elijah). I don't necessarily agree with everything he says, but I can respect a socio-religious movement.</p>
<p>I meant I did not support groups that favored violence to accomplish goals. In the late 60's and early 70's, the landscape was littered with revolutionary groups. Not just racialy oriented groups, but communists and anarchists and a slew of bizarre religious cults. Most of this stuff was just the bad hangover from the mood domestic change and demonstration, and I don't consider them legitimate political movements. When someone uses the phrase "<Black/White/Brown/Gay/Girl> Power" I don't think about social advancement, I think about exclusionary political views. I think about hate, seperatism and the use of politics as a battle for dominance.</p>

===message:Chris, though you rephrased your discussion I truly think you dont get it.  All tried to be non violent and it just got thier heads cracked open.  Though thier was many who would have preffered non violence it just was not working.  Martin Luther King was probably the most tolerable of many men but the US saw him as a enormouse threat to the way of life and you know the results.  Please don't humble us with a revision when its obvious you feel the way you feel!

===message:Kathryn, I resent the fact that you believe this country was formed by rapists and murderers.  Several reasons,When England wanted to get rid of their convicts to help lessen the jails they sent them to Australia not america.  In fact, some colonies (such as Georgia)were established by England so that they might send their poor but ended up sending only their best and most wealthiest because that was what worked in the previous colonies (and the fee to come here was outragous).

===message:well chris i disagree. i feel that the fight for civil rights extension was actually a struggle for survival as a people. do you actually feel that the chicano's or the african americans would have survived as a people knowing what all was going on. yes the native american had treaties broken and they surely did deserve their land and the other things they fought for. however, the other groups had promises and rights broken as well. after all it was the one of the other groups (black panthers) that prompted the native americans to establish (AIM). isn't that a bit discriminatory to suggest that the latter 2 groups were illegitimate?

===message:i'm not understanding when you refer to the struggle of the native americans as a struggle to exist as a people. the other groups were fighting for this very same thing. they all had things stolen from them and they were all oppressed. it's not like the african americans and the chicano's just wanted to dominate, they wanted equal rights. they didn't have total equality and they still don't which is why the group still exists today. i don't see the differences that you are implicating. you have the right to your opinion i'm just trying to understand what you're saying.

===message:I disagree, there were civil rights leaders who lead different boycotts, marches, and rallies who protested against violence. For example, Martin Luther King was for nonviolence and all of his marches were nonviolence and he wanted equal rights for all minority groups.

===message:I believe that some people looked at Martin Luther King Jr. as a black power leader that was on the move during those times. I do understand how you view Martin Luther King Jr. I think during those times there were only a few positive people that kept hope alive in some people lives and to those people those that kept hope alive in there life were black power leaders. Thanks for your clearer understanding from your posting.
