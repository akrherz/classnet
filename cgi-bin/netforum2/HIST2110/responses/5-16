===message:I agree, the Civil War open the gates for great opportunities, end of slavery along with the banking system as you mentioned.  Both were highly controversial topics for many years.  With the Civil War the banking system provided a means to support the military which was need of much support.

===message:I think you made two major important points here.  The first being that the benefit of the war, was the end of slavery, because without the war, slavery might not have ended or, the north and south could have ended up destroying each other over their differences. The end of slavery gave African Americans the freedom and life that they deserved all along.  Also, the new banking system really helped boost the economic growth for our country which has helped make our country so powerful and more economically stable than other countries today.  In the end, the war, I believe, had more adavantages afterwards, than disadvantages.
