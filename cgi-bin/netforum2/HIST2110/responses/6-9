===message:Reconstruction was not a failure.  Some of the concepts were not favorable but how can you say it was a failure.  This was a bloody war.  Are the defeated suppossed to be rewarded for thier beliefs.  The whole purpose for Reconstruction was to admit the succeeding states back into the Union.  But dont forget it was still a War. The success that you state was more of a failure than reconstruction by your analysis due to the fact that they still struggled many years after being made amendments.  In any war the conquering army will have thier own agenda but the stupid  part is that the very reasons for the war got lost in the reconstruction period.

===message:I agree that Reconstruction was a failure and a success. President Johnson had his personal goals for reconstruciton along with many others. As far as it being a success I totally agree that the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were a product of the success.  These Amendments were the breaking point for southern blacks.  The Radical Republican supported black suffrage which many did not agree with so in this time the name "Radical" is more than appropriate.

===message:I also agree that President Johnson had his own personal goals for reconstruction but as far as the success of the amendments I must disagree.  The amendments were a great outcome of reconstruction but I would shy away from calling them a success because they were never truly implemented during that time.

===message:You brought up several good points.  The failure of Reconstruction could have very well been President Johnson’s doing.   I did not think of his actions as being the cause of failure.  While I am on the subject of President Johnson’s plan, do you think that his plan was not a little ironic.  He wanted to decrease the power of the elites, by making the common person more powerful.  With this in mind, would his plan not have made the common person the elite and the elite person common?  Also, how could he make the few elites the majority of common people?  What are your thoughts on this?  I further agree with you on your statement about the limits of Reconstruction.  The personal agendas did set the stage for a vast array of limitless possibilities.  If it would not have been for the Democrats coming to power, then reconstruction may have continued on its path.  Of course, with the Democrats coming to office, there were many new agendas.

===message:I totally disagree Reconstruction was not a total failure. Just like all plans they have 2 or more different sides and in this situation everyone had plan of their own that thought was better than the next man,
