===message:I agree that Reconstruction was a failure, but I also see it as a success.  I see it as a failure because Congress did not promote freedmens independence through land reform.  During the time southern blacks not having property lacked the economic power to defend their righs an dinteres as free citizens.  As far as a success so many positive things came about like the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendements which of course came with limitations.  And the Radical Republicans supported black suffrage, but ultimately turned to govenment and economics which southern blacks would not benefit their success.

===message:I agree.  African-Americans were basically used as a pawn.  It gave the Radical Republicans something to concentrate on until something better came along.  It goes back to Emanicipation in which it's sole purpose was to weaken the Souther free-labor work force and make them return to the Union.  It only had to do with the fact that slavery was seen as wrong about 3%.  Slavery was wrong, but African-Americans were not equal.  During the Reconstruction, an attempt was made to remedy that or was it?  By making freedsman feel gratitude to the Republican party, the party received the political clout it needed to pass Amendments and get things done that they wanted.  Once Reconstruction was no longer a helpful tool and Republicans were losing their political strong-hold, freedman were tossed aside again.  At least this time, they got a taste of what could be.
