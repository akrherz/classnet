===message:I am in full agreement with you.  However, I do believe the Radical Republicans expected support from the whole country because they held the power in government and the changes they were implementing were in the best interest of all citizens such as opening of public school, creating college institutions, abolishment of slavery, granting blacks the right to vote in political elections, building roads, bridges, and public buildings.  The Radical Republicans failed to realize or didn't care that everyone was not ready for some of these changes.  Also, in view of all the good intentions of the Radical Republicans, why were women rights pushed aside as being insignificant?

===message:It is possible to say that women's rights were pushed aside because they were not seen as a crucial issue.  The big questions on people's minds was what to do with all of the freed blacks and the south, and then it turned to the financial crisis.  If a large portion of the voters were not concerned with it, then most politicians don't waste their time on it.  Especially not something as controversial as that.

Good question!  Unfortunately, I think although the Radical Republicans had overall good intentions, they were not interested in the fine details and did not pursue to satisfy the entire country (including women), which can be a feat in itself.  Of course, regardless of their specific failures, they were headed on the right track and had it not been for some certain successes, we might not be the Country we are today.  Constantly moving towards a better country.......

===message:Good point, Chad.  I agree that at that particular time in our history, women's rights were certainly not a priority.  Luckily, we have evolved and things have changed, but your comment makes perfect sense considering the time period and all the other things that were occupying our government.

===message:Reconstruction appeared to be a complete failure.  On the surface it appeared to be a very good idea - one in which blacks would be able to be active participants in all facets of life in a United country.  Radical republicans wanted to enfranchise blacks - even give them all of the rights of every other citizen of our country at that time.  The south however (and even many citizens of the north) were interested in blacks having the same rights as whites.  Even Lincoln didn't envision blacks as equal citizens.  The radical republicans had great ideas however because of the general mood of the country - that blacks were inferior to whites and always would be - it would prove to be next to impossible to fully "reconstruct" the south.  Things would never go back to "the way they were" nor would southerners ever accept blacks as full citizens.
