===message:I hadn't thought about it before, but you are right...Lewinsky gate would not have been blown out of proportion if Clinton had not lied.  I can remember Clinton pointing into the camera declaring "I did not have sexual relations with that woman" and then finding out it was all semantics.  He made the situation much worse than it was...it may not have been a "gate" at all if he had told the truth and let it hit the fan!
