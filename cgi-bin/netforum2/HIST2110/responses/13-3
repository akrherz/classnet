===message:Kristi, All the rationals given reflect so many issues the people of this country had to deal with, especially the poor. The rich work hard to manipulate others to keep what they have, in order to get more, and the poor struggle just to GET a far share of a decent life existence. There are so many people here in America who are hungry and live in poor hazardous living conditions.This country need to take care of home first before trying to correct other countries problems.Better off is difficult to determine if we live from day to day, worry about lossing our jobs, homes, no health insurance because we can't afford the escalated cost, fear of terroristic attacks, fear of being a victim from so many situations.We can't trust things to run smoothe,or have a Leader who really cares about all the population not just a select few. The Reaganites were only concern with self gratification at the expense of the poor and elderly citizens. The yuppie generation were moving up and over anyone or thing that stood in their way.This is what the  turned inward meant during the time Reagan was president.Reagan's message of individualism easily translated into self centered materialism.

===message:I agree with you this country do need to take care of home first because there is so much to do right here in our own front yards, right here in  Ga. (Atlanta), it don’t make no since but we are always going to help the next man and not our own. Also, you are correct politics never has and never will run smooth; it’s greedy and self-serving and until that ends the American people should also keep their ears and eyes open about what is going on in politics.

===message:I really don't think that there have been a lot of strides since the civil rights movements.  Most gains have either stopped or are going backwards like Affirmative Action.  Prejudice is something that will not end.  It is part of a person's nature.  Everyone is prejudice against something.  Beets are better than spinach, Baptist is better than Protestant.  It will always be something from now until the end.  It is what we do about our prejudice and what we learn from it that counts.  Enough has not been learned by the majority in our society to make a huge difference.  It is important for those in other countries to enjoy the freedom that America stands for, but when will there be equality here?  When will everyone have the same opportunities here?  If you think that everyone does you live in a dream world.  There are so many variables that go into being able to attain the "American Dream" that those who don't do it are looked upon as lazy and not worthy.  Take a look around you, although there has been progression, it is not in a hurry.

===message:We are better off today when it comes to the civil rights movements. But the issues on unemployment, crime, and poverty are still big issues today. In my opinion we are not better off we it come to these conditions. The American people still have a long way to go to correct these issues. We need another Clinton in office!
