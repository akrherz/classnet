===message:That's true.  Many people look at Reagan as though all of the bad things that happened was his fault when they really weren't.  They don't really focus on the good things he had done for the country, like what you had mentioned about him ending the Cold War and all of the other things.  You made some good points.

===message:I definitely see your point about there not being a Cold War today but the anti-American war with the Middle East was broaden don't you think?  I guess through this course we've all learned that each generation/administration has had its war to worry about.  I just think that Middle East is far more deadly than that of the Soviet's back in the day.  Government extremists are one thing but religious extremists are another.  Extreme religion backed by twisted dictator's and their illusions are a deadly combination that seems to be beyond negotiations.  What do we do?
