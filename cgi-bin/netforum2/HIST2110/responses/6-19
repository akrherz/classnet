===message:I agree with your point that while the blacks were freed, they were by no means considered equals.  Even in the Northern states, which had fought to free the slaves, they were not always welcome and in some instances even prohibited.  In the South, the slave system was replaced by the "Black Codes" and sharecropping.  In all reality, one form of slavery was simply traded for another.

===message:I believe that the emancipation of the slaves was a prime example of what people would do when they got what they really wanted.  All the Radicals were concerned with was winning the fight of the "southern question" but once the fight was over they had no idea of how to handle the freedmen.  They were literally thrown to the wolves.  Those wolves being their enraged ex-masters.  Until this class, I honestly did not realize the depth of the crisis in this era.  I certainly did not realize the effect and particiapation that African-American people had in our government at such an early stage.

===message:Your point were great but I can not totally agree with you that it was succesful in reuniting the nation.  We were still [retty much divided on several issues, mainly the teatment of black americans.  Agriculture versus industry we still had a ways to go to mend this relationship.
