===message:Robert, I do agree with what you said. I had to take another look at the question do you think it is un-American to disrespect the president.I was taught to respect those who respect you,and respect those in authority.

===message:I wouldn't say it's un-American to disrespect the President. We don't swear an oath to serve the president unless you are in the military. I think it's our duty as good citizens to question and critique our leaders.

===message:Kathryn, I do think that it is un-American not to respect your President, because we establish a system for electing our President and if we don’t like the system then we have the right to change it. We have told the world and ourselves that the President is a leader and what kind of message does it tell everyone else if we our unable to come together in supporting him.  There is always a difference between respect and rudeness. We will always have the right to speak against someone in this country, but when we do the delivery the message it should be one of thought and insight and not one of disrespect. One example is, the type forum that we use in this class. Anyone could response to your message saying a number a rude remarks about your message, but I have found that people respond in a positive way. There actions show, that they respect what I have to say in the forum whether they agree with my viewpoints and this is the type of respect that I am talking about.

===message:Awesome response, Robert!!!  I forgot to answer the American v. un-American part of the question and thought it would be easiest to just agree with your response.  I couldn't have said it better.

===message:Chris, your right that we don’t swear an oath to the President, but the position is our commander and chief and with that title comes a certain amount of respect. Just like we respect our boss, police officers, parents, spouses, and etc. We may never agree with their viewpoints, but we tend to still show them a certain amount of respect. The only difference is that the President is our voice and leadership to the other parts of the world. I love the fact that I live in democracy were I can make comments about the elected officials, but I never lose sight in knowing that I have this freedom because I live in America. In saying that I do think that it is un-America not to respect your President or any elected officials, because I know that have the right to change who ever is in power come next election cycle. Anyone can be rude and disrespectful, but it takes an individual that has a certain of class and dignity to respond in a thoughtful and intelligent manner.

===message:Despite this list of great “replies” I still somewhat agree with Chris about the un-American thing!   In my post I stated that I did not feel it was un-American to not respect the President.  I just think it works a little different than everyone else.  The office of the President and the President himself will have my respect until unearned!  I lost all respect for Clinton during his "scandal" because he lied and because of what he did, I don't think that makes me un-American! Sorry!
