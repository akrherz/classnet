===message:I don't feel that it is un-American not to respect your President because I think that respecting the office of Presidency and respecting the person holding that office can be viewed separately. Do you think the people that didn't vote for Bush respect him? I don't so I think they respect his office but not him. If I respect you I must think something of you to do so, so why didn't I vote for you? I think when we are talking about respecting the President we should be more focused on how he/she runs this country and not his/her personal life because what he/she do in his/her personal wasn't even important until he/she became President anyway and that's not fare.

===message:I think most politicians know how to manuver the law to benefit thier goal.  Nixon was obsessed with subversion tactics.  Nixon knew well the consequences of his action but as usual did not think he would get caught.  Everyones know that it was a fluke that they got caught or was it.  Enough people knew about  WaterGate maybe someone got a guilt feeling.  I agree with your assesment of the Clinton scandal it did not go anywhere close to what Nixon did.
