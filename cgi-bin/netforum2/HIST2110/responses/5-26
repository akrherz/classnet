===message:It appears by and large that while war became a necessary evil, the end result was a stronger union.  Can anyone argue that the end of slavery, the establishment of a national banking system, and promotion of large scale business are bad things?  While the weakening of states powers and expanded federal powers sound like negatives they weren't necessarily all bad. States should not have the right to do as they please to the detriment of the Union.  We can all point to instances or cases where we feel that the Federal government has way too may powers but we should learn from the past.  Sometimes allowing states to fully govern themselves can lead to far worse problems. Would we want to live in fear of continuous war against ourselves?
