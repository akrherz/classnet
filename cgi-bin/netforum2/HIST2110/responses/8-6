===message:I agree with you throughout your discussion.  I especially agree with you statement that war is always avoidable.  After all, "all you have to do in life is pay taxes and die."  I agree with you.  Your following statement is the reason America becomes involved in other disputes.  The avoidance of war is potentially detrimental to the citizens of an avoided country.

===message:I do have to disagree with the two of you that war is always avoidable.  Per my reply to Kathryn and her discussion, “force is the only language” some dictators understand.  Although the U.S. did not save near as many Jewish lives as we now know were lost, we did save some by entering the war!  I would hate to think that the few we saved would have been lost had we “avoided” the war for our own sake.  This is not meant to minimize the lose of American lives or the lives of any other soldiers; this is just a point about Hitler and his need for distruction.

===message:War is always avoidable.  However the options depend heavily on the parties that are involved.  It is up to the individuals to come to some sort of consensus.  There is always an alternative to force.
