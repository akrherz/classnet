===message:I agree, but I pose this question.  How could we have felt that we were safe from outsiders, when we have had several terroristic incidents in our own back yard?  The government in my opinion knew that there was a possiblity of attacks just as I'm sure China, South Korea, and countries invaded by Germany and Italy knew that there was a possibility.  If someone wants to get you on a global or personal level, they will find a way.  What makes the U.S so different.  Differences is the problem.  No one wants to except differences.  Differences foster fear and fear fosters violence.  Reading about the U.S and Russia competing to see who could make the worst bomb the fastest reminded me of two children building castles with blocks.  As intelligent people, why would we think that duck tape(I know it is used for everything else) and plastic sheeting would keep out chemicals that you probably can't even see?  How would you breathe if your house including vents were covered with plastic?  It boggles the mind.

===message:I totally agree with your point of view. I refuse to believe that America, China, South Korea, and countries that have been invaded did not know in one way or another that they would be attacked. This is not America's first time under attack the Twin Towers were attacked before 9/11 so America already knew the deal. We live in this country not really knowing what goes on in government but what we are told have the time. And I also agree that this duck tape and plastic sheeting what is it really going to do kill us slow or fast? You made some GREAT POINTS!!!!!
