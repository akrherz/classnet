===message:I agree that it's not un-American not to respect the President, to a degree.  I feel that you can lose respect for the man that is President, but that you should respect the office of the Presidency.  The military has a similar saying that you "salute the rank, not the man."  I believe that you should respect the Presidency, but not necessarily the man that holds the position
