===message:Do you think that if the British had a clear understanding of the deal that William Pitt made with the colonists, or the great contribution they made in winning the war, Britain would have imposed the Acts to recoup wartime debt from the colonies?  It appears that the only reason for the taxation acts was for the purpose of making the colonists accountable for a debt that they were seen as benefiting from without contributing to it.  I think that eventually the colonies still would have demanded their independence based on the human need for freedom from oppression real or imagined.  Some other colonists would have voiced concern about something else that was not liked in Britian and led the colonies to separate from Britain.  Life is fueled by conflict.  It is how we deal with that conflict that determines whether we are a healthy society.

===message:rob, while i respect your viewpoint, i cant help but disagree.  it was not the stamp act that most outraged the colonists, but the tea act.  the stamp act while most successfully boycotted, was looked upon as a joke by colonists and georgia was the only colony successful in selling it.  the tea act on the other hand was most widely rejected not because of price (in fact it lowered the price of tea) but because that england had demonstrated its power of creating a monopoly.  and if they could do this on tea, what would be next...
