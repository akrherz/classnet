===message:The British government wanted retribution for the large amount of debt accumulated during Seven Years' War.  I believe you are right in saying that the passing of laws without Anglo-American consent was wrong.  But, the Anglo-Americans should have to pay some type of debt relief to Britain for supplying funds for the war.  There seems to be a lack of communication between Britain and American Colonists.  I think that breaks in communication contributed to the uprising.

===message:I agree Ashley.  The British should have informed the Americans instead of acting as if they had no say in being taxed.  That is exactly what angered them, and the whole thing could have been avoided with better lines of communication between the British and Americans.

===message:Once again, we seem to all be in agreement that the British simply demanded or imposed their will onto the Americans without attempting to explain or justify their actions.  One right after the other taxes were imposed (forced) on the colonists (Stamp Act, Sugar Act, Quartering Act) in order to get them to pay their part of the war debt without consideration.  I truly believe in my opinion the miscommunication existed primarily with the British in that they DID NOT COMMUNICATE. Had the British approached the colonists with a FAIR and reasonable tax and explained their reasoning as to why they felt the tax was necessary, although some may have still disagreed, the majority of colonists would have accepted the taxation. Basically, as with anything it boils down to how things are presented as to how people will respond. The colonists understood that debt had been incurred from the War and would have been willing to pay their fair share (remember they were passive with regards to the Sugar Act it was the Stamp Act that caused major colonial dissatisfaction) had it been approached in thier eyes fairly.  I belive the British would have never imposed such harsh or extreme levies on British citizens because they would have known they could not have gotten away with it, no matter how loyal they were to the crown.  They only imposed them on the colonists because they thought they could get away with it.

===message:I agree partly with your assesment.  In where I disagree is that I feel that the bickering would have not been totaly resolved.  The British government felt the American colonies owed them for thier protection!

===message:The taxation of the colonies was the exact opposite of what was promised by the British.  They were promised that if the colonies provided the manpower, the British would fund the war.  As in any new endevor, there was not an excess of money.  The economic status of the Americans was not on firm ground.  They agreed to what they felt they could provide, but at a later time the British changed the rules and tried several ways to offset their cost...In part because the citizens of Britain were angry that they funded the war and were not aware of the contributions of the colonist.

===message:i believe that the americans were right. it seems as though the british were all about the anglo american ways. wanting to be like the "king" era. and control the colonies under their rule. i think that americans didn't want that dictatorship. they wanted to have an american government of its own.

===message:NOT Ashley, but in response to Mayumi...
dictatorship? dictatorship!?  do you mean to say that just because england desired taxes, which served as reimbursement for a war that was to protect the colonists, that they desired absolute power and authority?  i think not... on a side note, i believe the era you were looking for is monarchial, not "king".

===message:I think that the British were fair with the Americans. Think about it from there prospective. England wanted to expand its empire (that’s what empires do). So they invested huge amounts of money and blood to make the colonies a reality. England provided startup funds established infrastructure and an instant local government. They also provided military protection. The Americans had enjoyed a free ride for quite a while and were not open to the taxes. I doubt having elected officials in Parliament would have made a difference. When the colonies started to get uppity the Brits responded. If I had such a large investment at stake I would not look kindly on any dissent. While I do not know for sure I suspect that the situation was the same in other colonies. The British did not create colonies to spread goodwill. They created them to expand the power of the empire as well as create new trade partners for England.
