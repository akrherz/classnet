===message:Very well stated.  I would have sided with the Antifederalists, however.  I believe that the guarantee of individuals’ rights would have persuaded me to side with them.  Also, the similarity that you mentioned would also lead me to this conclusion.  However, your point on the stability of separate states is a concept that I have not considered.  Eventually, the states probably would have fought with each other, whether through physical war or diplomatic war.  Yes, the citizens would have the right to vote and so forth, on paper.  Remember, a government like the Federalists proposed had never been created, so a promise on paper could have turned out empty as the Antifederalist feared.  I think that maybe the influence of others around people of this time could have affected the thoughts and beliefs of many back then, such as religion or location.  What do you think?

===message:Good points but I also think state leadership and location would had play a key part in the  decision.  For example, the Federalist won crucial support from West Virginia who wanted a government that could put a end to the Indian raids.  On the other hand, can you blame the Antifederalist for feeling the way that they did?  I do not think so.

===message:Wow!  You did a great job in answering the question.  I wouldn't have changed a thing.  I like the point you made about how one national government with a lot of state governments is better than just the state governments by themselves, because it is best that there is a main government to handle all of the others.

===message:I must first start by saying that you did a great job. Also, you broke it down and gave me a different way of viewing the big picture. Even though I still would have chosen to side with the Antifederalist because I feel the Federalist did not have everyone’s best interest in mind (the common people) I also feel that the way you drew the picture it was to perfect to be true for something that was new and in those times I probably would have question the sincerity of this new government with my focus on the common people.But also I probably would have been to scared to agree with Federalist do the fact that we had just finish fighting a war for independence and that this government was new.
