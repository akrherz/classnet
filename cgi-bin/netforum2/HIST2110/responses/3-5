===message:robert,  while i agree with most of your response, i do have a difference of opinion when it comes to the bill of rights.  you had stated that the bill of rights had served as a system of checks and balances for congress, and i do not believe this to be so.  the bill of rights is a declaration of civil liberties that should be granted to all persons in this country.  no where in the bill of rights does it say you may not tax me as high as you desire, but rather states freedoms such as speech, the carrying of arms and the right of a fair trial(rights that should be assumed by any government but were written out because the english government had trampled on these rights before.)
