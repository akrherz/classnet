===message:The most prevalent issue I see that relates the two wars is that they are both to stop leaders with violent expansionist desires.  My viewpoint is biased because I support Bush.  America wanted to take care of the issue 12 years ago because we knew that he had weapons of mass destruction (scud missles being an example) and the INTENT to use them.  For the past 12 years he has denied that he had these weapons saying that they had ALL been destroyed.  We have already seen this to be a lie as he has fired scud missles at our troops.  All of these protestors are just a bunch of tree hugging hippies.

===message:I feel the same way Chad.  Iraq poses a great threat on the whole world(Not just the US).  People should support their country and the soldiers that are giving their lives for us to be able to live the way we do.

===message:As everyone has experienced during the post 9/11 months, it is no fun to live in fear.  It is not comfortable to walk outside and not know if there will be another terror attack.  People make the argument that war is not good and it takes lives.  Which is true, but we must also realize that the lives lost paid for the freedoms we take forgranted everyday.  We live in a country where you can openly protest your government without reprocussions.  You have the liberty to choose where you want to live, what career you want and the freedom to worship when, where and how you feel.  Those people who are opposed to war need to remember that it was a war that brought you all of the everyday liberties you take for granted.  Regardless of how you feel about the President he was elected and it is our duty to support him and the soldiers.  They need support not protest.  This is not the time to be divided over political issues we need to unite and come together for the good of democracy, and the freedom to live a life without fear.
