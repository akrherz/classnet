===message:This is so true.  A lot of information that we have today is due to technology that allows us to have first hand knowledge of the real situation.  This was not the case of millions during the World War I era.  There may have been more supporters of the war if they had scene, firsthand, how innocent lives were being lost by underwater enemies.

===message:Kathryn, I was not "raised" to not believe everything I hear on the news.  Until recently I did believe everything.  The papers made some reports about the company that I work for that I knew were not true, that was a big eye opener for me!!!  As I said in my original post, the government controls the media reports, we only hear what they want us to hear.  I don't think that anyone, including the government, can make a truly educated decision on war!!

===message:The media does have a lot of influence on the American people that is why there should be some restrictions on certain issues. I think everyone has a right to express and voice their opinion, but if their views will bring conflict and confusing to the cause their should be restrictions on others views. If we are at war we need to unity and come together and not separated  because we are all Americans and the outcome effect all of us at the end.
