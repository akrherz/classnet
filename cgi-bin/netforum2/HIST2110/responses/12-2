===message:It's sad, but it's true, Chris.  I'm afraid I have to agree with your statement about our voting habits.  Unfortunately, I think that a lot of people who vote may not be completely aware of what they are voting for.  I, too, am guilty of not being a good political analyst and I must say that my own voting habits are not admirable.  I think we can agree that what voters should do is use all resources available to discover who these candidates are and what they stand for.  Sure, they all have some skeletons in their closets, but so does every other human on this planet.  Voting is a serious right and we should all take it a little more seriously.  The question is, how do we go about making this sort of dramatic change?

===message:Chris,

I agree with you about our voting habits.  Unfortunately, I think sometimes we feel all candidates are unsatisfactory and we either chose not to vote at all or listen and/or read to see which candidate has the most "dirt" from childhood to manhood and base our decision on irrelvant matters instead of focusing on the issues that are important and determining what changes we would like to see.

===message:Lindsay, I think each individual is responsible for changing their voting habits and agree we should take it more seriously.  It is an individual's right to vote and we all need to do some research on each candidate.  Also, we need to not only to understand the issues at hand but determine the effect it will have on our lives as citizens. But the question follows - will the candidate make an earnest effort to fulfill the promises made during his campaign?

===message:I agree with all of you (great point Chris) our voting habits do stink and it is up to yourself to change them.  I have to admit that I am just like Lindsay and don't take the time to research the candidates before voting.  And Carla, the question of whether the candidate will fulfill his promises, I think that will always be the question and we won't ever know the answer until we give the candidate the chance to prove it!

===message:Good point, Carla!  We've seen many times in the past that the presidents do not always fulfill their promises for a lot of different reasons.  I think as the voters, we should use the information we can gather about these candidates and see who is more likely to make us proud....and then pray!
