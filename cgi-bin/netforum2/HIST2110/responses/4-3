===message:I agree with your answer; I also liked the form of your answer of stating each questions and then answering it.  With that said, to the discussion at hand.  Your answer was quite interesting, especially your answer to the question of nonpartisan solutions.  I never thought of the north and south's agreement on the inequality of slaves, however, allow me to say that applying this thought to all Southerners and Northerners seems a little bit absurd.  You are right though; a majority of white Americans at that time saw black people as inferior, unfortunately.  I also believe that you are correct in your thought that a nonpartisan solution could have been reached through "much upheaval."  A lot of upheaval and a lot of compromise would have been necessary for the south and the north to agree on a solution.  They would also have had to gain a little trust for this to happen as well.  The north and the south were very wary of each other’s actions, fearing that each was after more power and more control over the other.  I do not know how the south and the north could have reached a compromise through the premise that whites were better than blacks.  How could have this been possible?  What about those who saw slaves and free blacks as equals, or a least deserving some respect and fair treatment?  Your reply to both my questions and comments would be greatly appreciated.

===message:Your answer was very well put together.  I agree with you with everything that you have stated.  I just have a question.  Knowing how passionate both the north and the southern states were about there stances on slavery and states rights, what nonpartisan solution do you think could have been reached?
