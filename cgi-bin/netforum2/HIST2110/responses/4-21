===message:I totally agree with you that slavery is a touchy subject which is why I believe there were so many problems in the past.  I think one of the main reasons of so many conflicts was that the North was doing one thing and the South was doing another.  It's like a child arguing why a sibling can do or not do one thing and they have to do the opposite.

===message:You are totally right; slavery is a touchy topic even today. The way slave were treated were not inhuman and not right. The feeling that both sides felt about slavery was serious. This was not going to end by a simple conversation between the two.

===message:yes, it's like that "tu quoque" argument that i'm sure many of us learned in critical thinking class. it's like both sides were arguing that what we're doing is right and so you should do it this way as well. one side says they're going to do it one way, but is divided by the opposing side causing a major conflict.

===message:Slavery was an issue that had to be resolved and it is still a touchy issue.  I feel the reason is because the main conflict was over people.  The South felt the slaves were property but the North saw them as feeling individuals.  If it had not been resolved due to the civil war I don't thinbk the counrty ever could have united.

===message:You are right.  The counrty wouldn't have united.  It would probably have come down to a civil war one way or another.  It was just a matter of time before it happened.  We all know that slavery isn't right.  It is hard to believe that people could have been so ignorant back then.
