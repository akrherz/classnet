===message:I disagree, just because someone does not respect their President that does not mean that they were misled or didn’t care. There could be other reasons why others don’t or loss respect for the President. There are many people who don’t respect Bush because of the wrong decisions he has made about the war and other issues. Therefore, being misled or don’t care enough is irrelevant.

===message:Mostly I think that politicians have a threshold of honesty.  I dont feel that politicians are 100% dishonest because many of them aredecent people. I do feel that many of the politicians of this era came from a subversive type environment that truly groomed them for deciet.
