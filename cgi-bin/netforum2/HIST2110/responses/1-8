===message:I agree with you that the British were confusing to the American colonies; furthermore, your statement about Americans feeling that they should not have to pay for some of the taxes imposed by Britain.  However, I disagree that Americans were participating in a war that was not theirs.  The war took place on their land, threatened their freedom, and had potential to remove some of their freedoms.  This war was very much their war.  I also feel that Britain had a right to tax the colonies.  After all, the colonies were British colonies.  Justly so, I think that the Americans also had a right to represent themselves in Parliament to counteract some of the taxes they felt were unjust. 
What are your thoughts on this?
