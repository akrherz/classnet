===message:The reason the Red-scare of the 1950's was so successful was that there was a part of truthfullness to it all.  Of course it was all sensationalized by the media and exploited by politicians for their gains but some of it was true.  They were spying on us and we were spying on them.  I wonder if their was a Red-White-and-Blue-scare in the USSR going on at the same time.  McCarthyism was so popular because the people so desperately wanted an explanation for the problems.  They also wanted a scapegoat.
