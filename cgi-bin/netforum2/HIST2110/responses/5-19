===message:I agree with you up to a point.  I think that you are correct in that the Civil War proved to be a growing experience for the United States.  It demanded growth from government all the way down to the daily tasks of the common man.  I disagree however with your view that nothing has changed.  Much has changed and will continue to change, but change is always slow when it comes to changing someone's mind if it ever happens at all.  Prejudice is part of America.  It is part of it's birth.  Each generation inherits their prejudicial ideals from those before them and learn how to feel about others from conditioning and observations.  Just as we are told that in any relationship between two people, you have to understand that you cannot change anyone else only yourself, this is true for our nation as well.  So I except the small changes in regard to government changes that benefit minority groups and protect the rights of individual citizens, but I am very aware that I must continue to work on changing myself, and that the changes in others will be their job.  By being an example and showing a better way as the North did to the South, things will continue to change, but it will be slow, that is a given.  Remember, ending slavery was not for the benefit of the slaves, but used as a strategy to weaken the South by taking away their ability to have more able bodied men out fighting.  Forced change is only a few feet faster than progress.

===message:yes, i agree. the ending of slavery did make the country begin to grow up. it's like the end of the war took away the brain of the country. no slaves to do the hard work....what do we do now????!!!! it made the country discover more logical, more humane methods of running itself effectively.
