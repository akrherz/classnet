===message:I think you made some excellent points Chad.   One being that the "Black Power" movement seemed to be more violent than the others.  Another excellent point, is that when they turned to violence, their goals shifted, and the quest for equality turned into a desire for superiority.  All the minority groups were oppressed, but in the end, the violence from the "Black Power" was promoting superiority over equality which should not have been their goal.  I do agreee with Chad that a lot of minority groups today will not settle for anything less than a completley matriarchal society, which is wrong because in today's society, minorities receive more benefits and in some cases more superiority.  So the tables have turned and the white man is oppressed in certain situations such as who would be hired first; a minority or a white man?  The answer today would have to be the minority no matter what the qualifications are of the two.  But the good aspect from the civil rights movement is that it gave minorities a sense of self-respect and pride for who they are and where they come from, which we all should be proud of.

===message:Your points are well taken.  I also believe that as a result of violence the paradigm shifted for these "groups."  Unfortunately violence, i.e. war, seems to be our country's "end-all" to most of all our political struggles and issues.  I can only hope with the amount of diversity among our American citizens, that we somehow, someday develop a true forum for settling our likes and dislikes.  I feel that without some decentralized form of commonality within our "people."  The melting pot that is American now will become the boiling pot of America's future......

===message:I disagree; there was never any movement for violence on their part. The violence came in when the whites burned down churches, and hose blacks down when they protested. The violence can from the whites and not all the time from blacks; you should know Martin Luther King was for nonviolence. Therefore, the movements were nonviolence.

===message:The Black Panthers were not supported by Martin Luther King Jr.  They were started by two young black college students with one goal:  war.  I agree that many blacks may have felt that they had been pushed into a corner by the brutality of the police.  however, your argument for the justification of violence on the part of the Black Panthers can beget the question "do two wrongs make a right."  i do not believe that Marting Luther King Jr. ever sought black power.  he protested inequality.  when they began to use violence and terrorism, they lost a measure of credibility.

===message:Of course the Black Power movement would have appeared to be more violent than the other groups, but the bottom line is, they were the first group to make a firm stand on equality. Do you not wish to believe that before Malcolm X, H. Rap Brown, and the Black Panthers that there were also non-violent protestors? These leaders were a result of a community pushed to the limit. The tactics of the Black Power movement helped paved the way for other groups. Their fight proved to the world that, police brutality and abuse from the white community could be combated.  As a result, the Black Power movement gained recognition and respect for their efforts.  I don’t agree that African-Americans fight for equality was shifted to superiority. I do agree that, in order to become equal, one must condition their mind to accept and believe that no one race is superior over the other and that we are all equal. I also disagree to your statement concerning minorities in the workplace. I don’t know how many jobs you have sought after, but that fact of the matter is, that more and more minorities are going to college, and trade schools to become competitive in the job market. As a precaution, standards were established to protect minorities from discrimination and to make sure that everybody has a fair and equal opportunity.

===message:This is a reply to your answer for the discussion question and also to that of Connie Plowden.  I completely and totally agree with the fact that violence did change things during the Black Power movement.  I do understand their anger and am sadden by the violence they themselves received but MLK's message with heard alot clear and lounder than that of Malcolm X.  MLK gained respect through his eloquent words and peaceful actions.  He spoke volumes to the conscience of the white community.  He wanted a community of brotherly love not of hatred and contempt.  In my eyes MLK's message far surpasses that of Malcolm X's hatred.  The behavior and actions of whites during that era were embedded in them by elders and was a learned behavior, for many, it was all they had ever known.  Think about the people of Iraq, do you think their first spoken words were anti-American?  No, it was embedded in them and now it is all they know and until they are exposed to different we can't blame them but open doors for them and treat them compassionately.  

On the issue of the movement turning from equal to superior, I agree.  I also think there has been yet another shift in the fight for civil rights in today's society.  Equal shifted to superior and now superior is special.  If the word is EQUAL then let us not waive from the meaning thereof.  Things such as the "Miss Black America Pagent", the Black College Fund and businesses that may have signs posted proclaiming "BLACK OWNED" are just belittling the civil rights fight that continues.  Pride in one's race nor knowledge of where one came from is positive.  However, you won't see me walk on campus with a shirt stamped "WHITE PRIDE".  How would I be perceived if I had a business and posted "WHITE OWNED" outside or hold my very own "Miss White America Pageant"?  I would be considered a racist, so why is it different for blacks?  That is not equal it is special.  I know the mistakes of my white ancestors and those of my ancestors of other races because we all know we can't argue that we are "pure" races at this point.  Our society is a melting pot.  Together we stand under one flag, we are Americans.  I will not take credit for, apologize for, give reporations to or give special treatment because of any of the mistakes of those in the past.  I didn't committ them nor even agree!!!    As an individual who comes from poverty, a single parent household that sometimes questioned where the next meal was coming from, I view the movements that Malcolm X and Black Power paved the way for as those such as Affirmative Action which is just plain, simple special treatment for blacks.   I don't support and I think that if he were alive today, neither would the great MLK himself.  He knew the true meaning of EQUAL and would have been much too proud to ask for SPECIAL.  EQUAL RIGHTS not special.  It puts us all on a level playing field, what we make of it depends on only our inner strenghths.  Never should race be considered for college admissions nor job placement.  It is grades that should get you into college and skills/education/drive that get you the job.  The poverty that I myself came from is no reason for me to lay down and accept it as my place in the world.  I, just as those of other races, can be the "rose that grew from concrete" and I expect no special treatment, only fair and equal, and those who do should hang their heads in shame for they exploiting the issue that some gave their very lives for.

===message:There will never be an America where no one is being discriminated against.  There is always going to be a majority and a minority.  America is getting to where discrimination is subtle not voiceful.  I am worried about the white man now.  Even though he may have better qualifications than someone else, he still may be overlooked b/c he is white.  He is becoming the minority because of what happened generations ago.  What happens if they come up with a White Power movement because of this?  Are they going to be called racists or activists?

===message:My sentiments exactly!  Not only are the middle-class white man's rights being pulled right out from under them but it is becoming increasingly more difficult for them to stand up for them.  Must the roles of discrimination reverse in order for some to feel EQUAL?  The Black Movement and many of the leaders of that era, with the exception of MLK, distorted the civil rights fight and it has never regained the integrity that his words and actions instilled in the fight.  Take some of the black movement leaders of today, Farahkan or "Rev." Jesse Jackson, for example.  They proclaim that their purpose and passion is civil rights.........the pursuit of of equal rights.  Being  a white woman ("other" would actually describe my race more acurately), do you think either of them will come to defend me if I am denied admissions to Spelman College?  They fight for equal rights, right?  They would not be caught dead defending my rights.  Farahkan speaks hate, Jesse Jackson uses the threat of boycotts and law suits against big companies who don't believe in Affirmative Action policies.  Leaders such as these do nothing more than drive wedges between our races.  They are exploiting not only the fight for civil rights by not fighting for EQUAL rights but they are exploiting the black community themselves.  They have karisma, I'll give them that, and they would be great at prep rally but their integrity and destorted messages are killing the cause.  I think that both of these leaders saw that they could woo crowds and that they could raise money to live their desired lifestyles while creating a protective "womb" around themselves of "Civil Rights Activists" where they could conduct themselves in any fashion and get away with it.  Starting tomorrow I am going to establish my own coalition for civil rights.  You can call me Rev. Star and when I steal the funds from the people who support my cause, just overlook it.  Or better yet, since we were speaking of the white man's struggle, I suggest we rally for the MILLION WHITE MAN MARCH.
