===message:Reconstruction di have its good and bad, as with everything else in life.  I feel that the Reconstruction and actions of the Radical Republicans were the success in Reconstruction.  However, I feel that the real negative in Reconstruction was that it could not reconstruct the thinking of the many Southerners, who continually denied th rights granted by the 13th, 14th, and 15th admendments.  Th use of military force would have greatly increased the need for Southerners to change their ways; however, this probably would have only created more tension among the narrow-minded Southerners.  Your answer was well thought out and expressed; very good.
