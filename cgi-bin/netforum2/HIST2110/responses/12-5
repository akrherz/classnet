===message:I could not have said it better myself Carla.  Respect for the person and respect for the position are two different things.  Why this situation was an issue for Clinton, but not for the many other Presidents who have had documented mistresses, I do not know.  What he did was wrong in my opinion, but it really didn't have anything to do with me.  We will never have a President or any individual in office who is squeaky clean.  I don't think that is possible based on the monster called "politics"
