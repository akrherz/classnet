===message:But the war had been fought to enable the colonial settlers to have more land so why shouldn't they contribute to the expenses of the war?  it's like asking the police to protect us and us declare that we are not going to pay them.

===message:The French and Indian War was essentially a European war that spilled over onto North America.  England and France had been fighting for centures before North America was discovered by Europe and colonized.  The colonies were pulled into this conflict by thier parent nations, England and France, otherwise they man well have been content to exist in the New World in harmoney.  In essence, England brought troops over to capture the French claims in North America as part of the war they had been waging in Europe, and then wanted the colonies to help fight in it and help pay for it.  All the while letting the British citizenry believe that the war was won solely by the British professional soldiers as if the colonies had no part in the victory.

===message:Maybe the colonies might have lived in "harmony" without the Europeans coming over and starting a war.  But, the people living in the colonies all mostly descended from Europe.  I think that the main struggles where because the people of Europe still had the whole Roman Empire motif going.  They thought that the more land would equal more power.  More power leading to more money.  The colonies in America where just caught in the middle of the struggle.  But, the Indians would have been living in harmony if it wasn't for the settlers coming and taking over land.
