===message:"The people of the US are so open minded to the ways of the world that the same propaganda tactics would not work. You cannot pull the wool over our eyes now, we would see it a mile away."  Are these the same people rushing home depot's nationwide for plastic and duct-tape?  I do not agree with you in the idea that americans of the past were naive...they just had no means of information.  It is much like the line between stupidity and ignorance.  Stupidity is when you cannot understand, ignorance is when you refuse to.

===message:<p>I find it interesting that you refer to the people of the early 20th century as being dependent on government and easily manipulated. This was pre "great society" America. The government was infinitely smaller in function than it is today and the government wasn't nearly the forcefull presence in everyday life that it is today. Today we depend on government to make decisions for us in the form of what we should or should not ingest via the "War on Drugs", we trust the government to clothe and feed us in our need via the failed "Great Society" programs, and we trust in government to provide our retirement. There is a growing majority in favor of even MORE government dependency.</P>
<p>And as far as manipulation, I can point out the manipulation that is carried out in every election. The Republicans took control of the House and Sentate in '94 with promises of shrinking the federal government and never disbanded even one federal program. Sure, they claimed successes in spending cuts, but their definition of "cuts" was simply taking a projecting spending increase and reducing the amount of the increase. Thus they succeeded in spending less than the previous congress had planned, but it was still more than in previous years. Democrats scared seniors and minorities into voting for them by saying Republicans want to destroy social welfare programs and roll back the clock on civil rights legislation. Both sides are blatant liars. Republicans will never shrink government and give true tax relief to anyone, rich or poor. Democrats will continue to lead their constituancy on with promises they can not or will not keep. Americans, in general, are just as easily manipulated as they ever were, possibly morso. With the increased depency on government, people are more inclined to turn to the government for the answers to their problems</p>
<p>Lest we fall back into the mistakes of the past, we should be ever vigilant. When we look back on history with arrogance, we fail to see our own current shortcomings.</p>

===message:I do not feel the the label naive was appropriate.  the people had very few means of obtaining information and if the Government controlled these avenues what else are the people supposed to believe.  Secondly, I feel that "modern people" are still easily manipulated.  Just look back at the Y2K incedent when everyone was fearful that there would be mass chaos in the world.  Even now everyon is fearful of the War so you can not find any supplies at home depot.

===message:I agree with you up to a point.  I don't think that everyone in society is so hip and informed that they would not believe propoganda techniques if used regarding war in 2003.  The same techniques are used to make us want to buy a particular car, wear a purfume, and dress the way we do.  We are still influenced by the media and not always in a good way.  A lot of what is fed to Americans is half truths and stereotypes, but we eat it up.  A man is guilty until proven innocent.  I wonder why?  There are many who think that if they read it in the newspaper or on the internet it has got to be true.  We believe what is easiest and most comfortable for us to believe.  Why else would someone go on a milk and water diet to lose weight?
