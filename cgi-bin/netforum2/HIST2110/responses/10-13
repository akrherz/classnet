===message:Good question, Mayumi.  I think it's a combination of lots of things, from economics to personal choices.  I don't think there is anything wrong with a parent (man or woman) staying home to raise a child if that suits their situation.  You're right, as long as your family unit as a whole is happy, what difference does it make?  My mother worked when I was young and I went to day-care and pre-school, but I turned out okay.  I think it depends on the time you actually do spend with your parent, whether that be all day or 5-6 hours a day. Use your time wisely!  I do not feel like I was raised by strangers, but I understand some people do.  All people are different from one another and some people may react differently to situations.  Some may prosper if they stay home with mom or dad and some may prosper if they don't.  I'm curious:  how do you feel about children developing social skills if they are home all day with adults?  I know play groups are possible, but some parents do not participate in those.  What do you think can be alternatives for play groups?  Since you have two at home, I know you can probably offer some suggestions (in case I'm ever lucky enough to be a home-maker!).   :)

===message:hi lindsay,
well as my kids teacher we also have weekly fieldtrips. we go to fernbank, we have an annual pass for stone mountain park which allows him to have access to the playground that's full of kids his age, the marina boat, the barn, the petting zoo. and we also go to story time at the library every other day, days that i don't have class :0) we eat lunch at mickey d's on these library days where he also gets social interaction along with all of the other children of stay at home mom's. so he has a social life. however when he starts first grade, he will be attending public school (hopefully we can get him in private school). i don't want to keep him from the social life that you get away from home. i want him to start establishing his own little ways, and start having little crushes on girls as he gets older. so i won't be homeschooling him throughout his entire schoolhood :0)but as for right now, he does get alot of social interaction. just this year we also started giving him slumber parties, well my husband says for little boys i'm suppose to refer to it as "sleep overs"...whatever. :0)

===message:You have really good ideas.  I hadn't even considered the library, but now that I think about it, the local library where I live hosts daily activities for children.  Good thinking!

===message:I feel that thier are a number of reasons why thier are stay at home mothers or home makers.  Some of which you mentioned.  But what I have found is that many women use the daycare cost as thier prime reason.  I know a few mothers who do the home school ritual and in some cases the kids excell in areas but fail in other areas.  I feel that for a child to be well rounded that they need an interaction that most families cant give them.  Now most will say that thier kids play with other kids and that they get plenty of activities but what about the learning style from different people.  Now I am sure you are very inteligent but at some point you have to wonder how your child will react when he is placed out of the security of the home school.  What I have seen is that home school fails the learning curve.  With today's ever evolving technology thier is no real way home school can keep up unless those monies saved from daycare is spent in keeping the child and the parent updated with the requirments of some of the higher scholastic schools for the age of the child.  Many children are not truly on the level that they need to be on in some areas of learning.

===message:I salute you!  I think there is nothing better than one parent staying home with the children.  I see that you have also decided to home school and that is a wonderful thing too.  My husband and I have decided to adopt as we cannot have children.  My husband stays at home with our little bundle of joy.  And I hold the highest respect for him for doing so.

===message:thanks for your opinion al. i have the material needed to homeschool my son. i have him on the first grade curriculom yet he is yet to be 5. he is very advance. i attribute it to my dedication to him and genetics :0) some children may not thrive if the parents aren't equipped mentally or scholastically. however i am. and i don't plan to homeschool him throughout his entire scholastic years. just until he's in the second grade which will allow him to not be left in a class that he has already accelled in. his birthday is 2 weeks behind the cut off date for school entrance. and i will not allow my child to be on a 4 year old level when he's already on a first grade level. when the child reaches second grade, he can be put into that grade regardless of his birthday being late.

===message:I too am a stay at home mother of a five year old and a four year old, but my children have attended pre-school three days a week since they were three.  My decision to stay home was based on the fact that I did not want to have to be away from my children all day long (purely selfish). Also, my husband's parents divorced when he was 2 years old and his mother always worked so he was very much in favor of my staying home with our children. It did take some sacrifices on our part due to losing one income, but we have found that for our family the sacrifices were well worth it.  I will tell you that I look forward to returning to the work force when I graduate in three years, which is the same time my youngest will be starting first grade.  I do enjoy my role as a stay at home mom, but I do not feel that it is what I was meant to do forever.
