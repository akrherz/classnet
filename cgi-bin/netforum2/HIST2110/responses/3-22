===message:How do you feel that it did not represent everyone equal?  The Anti-Federalist thought that the constitution was ultimately the doom of the states.  When the constitution is still in effect today it proves that the Federalists' position was the right side to be on.  The constitution was the seed that bloomed the great government of what we have today.
