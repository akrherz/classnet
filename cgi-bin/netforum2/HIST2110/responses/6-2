===message:The 13th - 15th Amendments were a great accomplishment of this era.  I forgot to mention that when I was typing my first post.  Giving freedmen the right to vote was one step in the right direction.  But, politicians only did this because they knew that the Freedmen, primarily in the South, could be taken advantage of.  90% of Freedmen could not read.  A light bulb went off in the Republicans head and they acted on this.
