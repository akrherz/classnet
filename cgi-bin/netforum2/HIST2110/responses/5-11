===message:You are right we must work together as one to get the job done and the Civil War did show that. I also agree with statement about internal disputes because the nation cannot move forward, grow, if we allow the hindrance of the past to interfere. But in those times could the Antifederalist really let go of what they fought so hard to get by going along with this new government that did not include the common people or African American?
