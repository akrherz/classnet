===message:Hindsight is 20/20 and I would like to think that I would have embraced the Federalist position. Clearly there had to be some balance between the national and state governments. States wanted to maintain their rights to self government and not be domininated by a "Federal" government. The framers wanted to put a stop to sometimes excessive power by the more populous states.  Compromise is a good thing. Had it been practiced perhaps the war between the colonies and Britain could have been averted.
