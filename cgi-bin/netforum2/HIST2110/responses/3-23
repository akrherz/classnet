===message:I agree with many of your points, especially regarding the class distinction between the Federalists and the Antifederalists. I tend to be automatically suspicious when one side has such a great public relations campaign going. But when I read the Constitution, and think of its evolution in our brief history, I am fairly awed. I'm glad that the Antifederalists were around to watch over our rights, but I think I would have been a Federalist in the end anyway.
