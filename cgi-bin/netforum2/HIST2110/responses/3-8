===message:I definately agree with you on your answer.  I would want some sort of guarantee as to whether the new government would work, because if it wouldn't have, then I would feel as if things should have been kept the same, instead of just messed up.

===message:I agree, the Anti-federalists wanted to make sure that everything stays the same and why should they take a risk with this new government and there is no gurantee that it will work. I'm with you I also need a guatantee that the new government will work.
