===message:Robert, I really liked that way that you answered this question. Simple, to the point, and easy to read.  I agree with your points about money and how it dictates the world.  Much like the "golden rule", whoever has the gold, makes the rules.

===message:That was a good point you made that we will always see war and destruction as long as money and power are the issues. The money and power issues are the main reasons why we went to war in the past and why we are at war now.
