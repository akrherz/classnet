===message:The Civil War propelled the United States into greatness. It destroyed the evil concept of slavery and caused the country to develop a much needed economic structure. It also created through the war large scale business, which was necessary for the financil structure of the country. It didn't weaken the states rights, it caused the federal government to step in and regulate the states, so the country can become united as one. The federal powers had to be expanded so the states wouldn't try another cessasion.
