===message:I agree.  In addition, one of the primary reasons the Albany Plan of Union failed is because no colonial legislative would surrender control over its power of taxation.  Today is no different - we want to see some benefits for the taxes we pay.

===message:You brought information that was not in the book and sheds new light onto the question at hand.  Furthermore, your comparision of the American colonies to that of the British colonies put a new perspective into the mix.  Maybe your idea of letting the Americans tax themselves would work; however, if Americans taxed themselves, would they still be considered British.  After all, Britain wanted the Americans to help pay for some of the expenses that Britain had acquired.  As British people, should not the colonies help the government as British loyalists?  I think that a representation in Parliament might have benefited more than just letting the Americans tax themselves.  If you think about it, Americans are always at a disagreement about taxes, throw in another country’s want of those taxes collected and spending of those taxes by way of their choosing would only create more drama and conflict.  The British were not all to blame.  Americans did their fair share of mud slinging.  Samuel Adams painted a different picture of the actions of the British soldiers, and the Americans’ use of compromise is hard to see.  You are correct; Britain’s reactions were sometimes overbearing, as with the Coercive act. Yet, Americans’ reactions were also a bit extreme as well, such as their mob-like riots.
