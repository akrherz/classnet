===message:I slightly disagree with you that people still see women as being the homemakers and baby-makers.  While both men and women felt this way in the 50's, I think only pig-headed men feel that way today.  I doubt you will meet many women who say that is our only purpose in life.  Most women, at least the ones I know, feel women should create their own destinies and if that includes taking care of a home and child, then so be it.  But, that does not mean that is all we are capable of.

===message:Maybe I wasn't clear when I said top executive I meant men, pig headed or not they still feel this way. Also this world is comprised of hundreds of thousands of women and me and you both only know a small percentage of them all so to say that their is know woman in this world that don't feel that a woman place is in the home is ridicules. Some women are taught as a child that her place is at home, different cultures, religions, up brings, whatever it may be some women do feel that their place is in the home.

===message:You're right; between the two of us, we do only know a small percentage of women and should not assume that all women feel a certain way.  However, we both only know a small percentage of men and to say that they all feel that women belong in the home is not accurate.  Maybe all the men you know feel that way, but only certain ones (pigs) I know feel that way.  My fiance certainly does not agree with your statement.  Isn't it redundant to say that we should not stereotype all women, but you think it's okay to stereotype all men?

I did not say all women nor all men those were your words I said men that are top-level executive, probably not all but I would say the majority, and women who were brought in a certain culture, certain up bringing, or even by ones on mother who was brought up that way a passed it down to their daughter. All men are not top-level executives and all women were not brought up that way, brought in that culture, nor had mothers that were brought up like that and pass it own to their daughter. But the reality is that there is a man that feel that way and a woman who agrees somewhere out there in this big universe. Who knows who know them you might not and I might not but they do exist.

===message:Lorena, I could not agree with you more.  Change can be good or bad.  I think that the changes made in women's fight for equality are good, but the reality is that until people's hearts are changed, there will never be equality for women, minorities or anyone that is different.  Changing of the heart can take a long time if at all.  Having the legal recourse to say, "Hey you are discriminating against me due to my gender", and sue is wonderful.  How many women who are in that situation are brave enough, or know enough to do that?  It's all in the heart.
