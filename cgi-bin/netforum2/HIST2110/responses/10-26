===message:Very well thought out.  I was impressed by your view point, especially in the fact that you took both sides into consideration.  I do have a question.  One, you mentioned that entertainment went as far as to stereotype career women as neurotics.  I am not sure how they did this.  I do agree with you that entertainment stereotyped the housewife.  You final quote, I thought, was very fitting and extremely appropriate.  However, I still have not realized whether you think that women are better off now than they were 50 years ago.  Do you think that some women are better off and others are not?  I believe that you made both sides clear, and I also think that you feel that some are and some are not better off.  Please, correct me if I am wrong.

===message:If confusion of whether I think women are better off today than the 1950's is what I relayed in my answer then I conveyed my thoughts, and the battle within me, perfectly!!  If today we lived in a perfect world, I would say that with all the advantages/rights we, as women, have gained that yes, women are "better off".  In a perfect world, I would obtain my Bachelor's, go to law school, marry as soon as I graduated to a perfect/successful "forsaken-me-for-no-other" type of guy, have a honeymoon baby, be a full time mother/housewife, do volunteer work with my law degree until my children enter school then start my own practice but pick up the kids by 3p, clean the house and cook all before my husband arrives home at 6p.  It is not a perfect world.  I think (or at least I tell myself) that this is the thought process of the majority of women before taking such giant steps forward!  I know things happen but it is not like you just wake up one day and you're pregnant.  Decisions are made and consequences are dealt with.  I mean, I'm hoping that I'm not the only one asking myself "what will I do when.....?"  What does a women do when she knows enough about herself that she realizes either role, that of mother/wife or of successful career women, could consume her at any moment?  That she holds each role in such high esteem that to be mediocre at either would be devasting.  What do we do now that the path has been paved for us, drive instilled in us and expectations set but something in you yearns to be a little old fashion?  As a woman, that is the struggle that lies within me.  Thanks for the reply.  Peace.
