===message:I agree that after the readings of both sides, it is quite hard to determine which side one would take.  I do feel, however, that if I had to choose one it would be the Antifederalist.  This is because of past, proven experience with a government that turned out to be quite controlling and operating for its own greedy interests, not the peoples.

===message:kathryn, you have a lot of good points in your article as well as numerous facts to support it and for that i give you applause...but i disagree with your last sentence in which you typed "I really don’t know which side I would have been on, but I know I definitely would have had an opinion."  how can you have and opinion on a subject when you are not willing to take a side?
