===message:I agree with what you are saying except one part.  I don't think that the British wanted to benefit from what the Americans could offer and vice-versa.  I think that the British wanted total control and they were not going to part with their ways, and the Americans wanted to seperate totally from the British.  I don't think they wanted to learn or benefit from what each other had to offer.  But i definetly agree with the fact that the British wanted all the control and they knew that if the Anglo-Americans were allowed into Parliament, it would weaken their control, so they refused to let that happen.  You did a good job of explaining.
