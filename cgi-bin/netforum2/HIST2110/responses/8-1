===message:Lindsay, I agree with you summation of the contentions between America and Japan. I also think that Japan was feeling secure in their position in light of the Tripartite Pact agreement with Germany and Italy. Japan knew president FDR was doing all he could to stay out of any potential war with any country,and thinking America was weak,Japan flirted with their liberties. After Japan invaded British Dutch and French colonies in Southern Asia(Indochina,Malaya,Philippines,bombing Pearl Harbor,expanding into Thailand,Hong Kong,Guam,Jave,and other allied forces in the Pacific)America imposed embargoes hoping Japan would stop their seige,nothing worked. War was imminent with Japan.
