===message:I tend to disagree with you.  I don’t think that the South’s strongest slavery supporters would have abolished slavery if not forced.  I am not sure the Industrial Revolution would have stopped the profitability of slavery.  Blacks were not equal to whites in any shape, form or fashion in this time frame.  What would the blacks have done if not encompassed by slavery?  They sure would have not gotten paid for their labor in the cotton fields and nobody considered smart enough to do much else.

===message:I totally disagree with your assesment.  Slavery was big business for the slave owners.  If not cotton or farming it would have been something else slaves would have been used for.

===message:<P>I just can't see it happening. Racism was so pervasive at the time, people didn't want to see slave blacks... or free blacks for that matter.</p> 
<p>In the South blacks were seen as property, they were fed clothed and provided for by their owners. Anyone who supports a family knows that this was not cheap. The costs of maintaining a slave (I'm speculating here) couldn't be much less, if at all, than hiring a worker. In the South, slaves were seen as a method to let whites avoid the menial labor in a large farming enterprise.</P>
<p>In the North, blacks were disliked. I think in a different and harsher manner. Where, in the South, you had blatant racism in perceptions of blacks being fit for menial labor, in the North slavery was unpopular mainly because it made white workers feel threatened.</P>
<p>In time, industrial methods would have spread across the South. Slavery would have simply become less ecconoicly viable than hiring workers. What would have happedn to the slaves? I'm not sure. I think it would have been similar to what happened when they were freed. The slaves were basicly told they didn't have to work on the plantations any more (the only thing most of them had known), but were left to cast about on their own. They became a permanent underclass plagued by undereducation, poverty and discrimination, invisible walls that have just started coming down in the last 50 years.</P>
