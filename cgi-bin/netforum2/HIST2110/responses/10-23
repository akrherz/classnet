===message:I agree with what you said.  Television did make the families seem as if they were just so happy and perfect.  We all know that families are going to have problems also, but they didn't really show things like that.  I know my life isn't normal but it still wouldn't make it as a real life t.v. show, because it'll be REAL boring to watch.  But anyway, I too believe women today have an option as to whether they would want to stay at home or not, unlike the past, since they have the courage to say how they really feel now.

===message:I disagree I felt that television did reflect the women's role correctly but as a family No television did not reflect the family picture correctly because back then women did stay at home and that it is what television reflected. Also, you are correct that television juice up situation to make them interesting for TV viewers because with out the juice it would be boring but in the 1950's women were housewives and that is how they were reflected as being on TV.

===message:It's true that television does not capture ALL aspects of an era and reinforces stereotypes but I believe shows like "I Love Lucy" were acurrate to the reality of most white women in the 1950s.  Lucy was a housewife, who when the need for money arose or when she was bored worked outside the home.  Ricky was the breadwinner however.  I think another aspect television accurately captured of the housewife was Lucy's ocassional dissatisfication at staying home.  Why else would Lucy and Ethel concoct the schemes they did?

My maternal grandmother was one of those housewives in the 1950s and she told me there was not much else for women to do in those days.  She said women were almost always expected to marry and have kids.  And for her (being a black woman) the only work she was able to do was domestic servitude.  To cure her boredom she took to watching soap operas. My grandfather was the breadwinner, he had his own plumbing business.

===message:Yes, TV might have reflected women's roles in the 1950s but not their attitudes about the roles.  In shows like "Leave it to Beaver" you never saw the mother bored.  TV gave women the idea that they were supposed to stay at home and like it, but I bet a great deal of them were not satisfied with doing just that.

===message:I agree, tv seemed to glorify the stay at home mom.  She always seemed satisfied and happy to please everyone in the family.  We must remember that the tv executives at the time were men; they wanted to portray women as happy women who were content in their role as homemaker.  The tv wives provided role models of how a woman should feel and act.  But I do agree, I do not think that this role was satisfing to all women and that is one factor as to why women looked to work outside the home.

===message:I agree with you.  Women did not have the options they have today.  I don't think they had as much responsibilities as they have today either.  For example, I live next door to a lady who is over 70.  She was talking to me the other day and said that her husband, who is now deceased, used to take care of all the bills.  She has her daughter balance her checkbook for her still today.  But, I also think that women put up with a lot more then then they do today.  Divorce was not as prevalent as it is today.
