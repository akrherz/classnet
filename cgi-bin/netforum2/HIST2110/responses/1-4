===message:I completely agree with your post.  Lack of communication between Parliment and the colonies seems to be the primary cause of problems during this period.  I feel that the colonies may have been more accepting of Parliment's laws had they had a better understanding of what Parliment was trying to achieve.  On the other hand, since Parliment was clearly trying to benefit themselves with the implementation of the taxes and attempts to increase their personal revenue to pay their royals and officers, I do not see that even if they communicated their intentions to the colonists that the colonists would have appreciated their efforts.

===message:Once again I agree that the underlying problem was that Britain attempted to force their will onto the colonists. Parliment at no time communicated thier actions or the reasoning behind their actions to the colonists they simply went forward (sometimes hurriedly and secretly like with the Townshend Duties) and expected complete obedience.  Britain was used to enforcing their will and thought they could get away with doing the same thing to the colonists.
The colonists were not trying to rock the boat, they only wanted to be represented and treated fairly as evidenced by their continued loyalty to Britain and the crown after the revocation of the Stamp Act in 1766.
