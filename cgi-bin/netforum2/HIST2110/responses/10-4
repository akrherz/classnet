===message:I respect and appreciate what you have said regarding women's roles in the 1950's and today, but I must point out that having a voice is important, but not always effective.  Women do have the right to speak up for themselves in the society that we live in, but what do you do if no one listens.  It is a wonderful thing to be the head of a company or start your own if you want, but compared to companies headed and started by men, where are we ranked.  There is only one Oprah Winfrey, and until women receive a larger piece of the American pie, they have to keep fighting, speaking, striving for equality.  Equality is something that for whatever reason, people are unable to attain.  Whether it is racial, gender, employment, housing, etc.  someone always wants to have more.  As a people, we have to learn to share in the wealth.  Having it all isn't that fun without someone to share it with.

===message:I understand that some times things may appear on the outside as not work out, but once you look inside you see that it is different. Now that I have confused the matter let me explain in more detail. First, every powerful, and successful male that has achieved some high rank in our society structure did so with the help of a woman. That lady could have been their wife, mother, sister, grandmother, or friend, but in any respect it was a woman. Second, the voices of women will always be mute to men that didn’t understand the need for their ideas and opinions. Third, we have progressed to the point that women are Deans of University, Doctors, Lawyers, and State representatives. Thirty years ago this would have been wishful thinking, but it is reality now. Fourth, I agree that there is only one Oprah Winfrey, but she has paved the way for hundreds more to take here place the future. Life is never fun without someone to share it with. Without understanding our differences, we will never appreciate their advantages.

===message:Robert, I sure hope you views travel to those that don't agree.  There are very few like you who realize what women have done for men.  Although we can't take all the credit, we do carry a lot of it.  I am fortunate enough to have several men in my life who respect me, my decisions and my advise and leadership.  I wish there were more men out there who did appreciate the roles of women in society today!  Ursula, so right you are about women's "voices".  I agree with your view that there will never be total equality with regard to racial, gender and employment!  Thanks to both of you!

===message:You hit that on the head you go girl. In our society today top-level executive who are men still feel that a woman place is not in big business. Women have fought all their lives for something from equal rights to freedom of speech and it appears that we will continue to fight until we all drop dead.

===message:I would say that all them are housewives. I feel that there is nothing wrong with being a housewife or working women. The problem is that people tend to label women as homebodies and nothing more. Just a side note,I think that when Hillary Clinton become President, she will do for the women movements than anyone has be able to accomplish before her.

===message:I don't disagree with you Robert, and I appreciate that fact that you are open-minded enough to consider the points that you presented.  As a woman and a minority, when I look at the whole picture I see the progress, but it is one of baby steps.  The goal of equality has not been reached.  How many Deans of colleges are there?  How many CEO's?  I say not enough.  There are plenty of women who have talk shows.  Oprah's success has a lot to do with the person that she is as much as the fact that she is an African American woman.  These are baby steps, and although necessary, not satisfying.  We still haven't reached our destination.
