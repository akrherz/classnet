===message:I believe I would also be a Antifederalist.  Yes, the Federalist proposed a checks and balance system but like you stated how do we know if it would have worked.  Like the Antifederalist I do not think and even division of power could be achied between the national and state government leaving lower and middle class with the short end of the stick.

===message:I believe that the Antifederalist did not know if this new form of government, check and balance, would benefit them but they felt that the common person was excluded from the plan. I do agree that the Federalist painted a picture perfect painting of a new government with all the trimmings but when the Antifederalist looked at the painting they did not see the common people the only people that they saw were the upper class. After the war for independence the Antifederalist did not wanted to try something that could possible take them back to where they fought so hard to come.
