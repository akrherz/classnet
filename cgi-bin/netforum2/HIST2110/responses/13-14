===message:I agree with your assesment but I tend to feel that we had a great run during the Clinton Administration.  Critics have claimed that we started declining druing the end of Clinton Administration but we still had a big surplus.  I do agree that we are better off than 20 years but isnt it ironic that under a republican president we are slipping fast into the years of the 80's.

===message:Great points in regards to the Reagan Era. Your point about people being more concerned with themselves than with the public good clearly explained the thought process of Americans during that time period. Uncertainty has always been part of every presidental legacy. Therefore the issues we face today are deeply rooted in the traditions we set many, many years ago.  Whether we are "better off" today than yesterday, depends upon your perspective.  Those individuals who have prospered from our country's economical roller coaster, technological advances, stock market peaks and valleys are better off.  In contrast those persons whom have yet to achieve the "American dream" are still wondering aimlessly attempting to survive.........

===message:i agree carla that is was due to other presidents not just reagan. and al, yes that is so try. i'm sure to some people from the 80's era, this seems like de ja vue sp? :0) things were great with clinton. he was humorous he was eccentric. and he was unorthodox, which i love!!! he didn't remind you of the typical republicanish president yet he still did a wonderful job. now look where we're at. the world's morale simply seems blah. the attitudes of most americans are like huh? what are we fighting over. many are confused and fustrated and seem to be distancing themselves from politics. as with all of the other life stresses many don't even want to be bothered with the whole bush, iraq issue they feel that it's senseless.
