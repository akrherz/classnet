===message:Clinton got caught in an extramarital affair and then lied to cover it up.  The only reason it made headlines was because he was President of the United States and not just Joe Nextdoor.  Nixon, on the other hand, lied about activities that only the President could have been a part in since they involved the upper levels of the American government.  The average Joe Nextdoor would never be in a position to do what Nixon did.

===message:I think it is unfair to judge the President based on what he did in his personal life.  The president is capable of making mistakes like everyone else is.  If he would not the President we would not be talking about this today.  He fooled around on his wife so, yes it is wrong but how many people committ adultery every single day.  If one of your co-workers was messing around on his wife would you ask him to resign?

===message:I believe Clinton got off easy because what he did wasn't as bad as what Nixon had done.  Yeah you're right when you said that both presidents lied, but wouldn't you believe the Watergate scandal was a whole lot worse.  I think Clinton lied to us because he may have thought of the humility it would bring to him and his family, and it did.  I don't know what was the matter with Nixon, I guess he figured that once the election was over he would have no problems, when in fact, that's when they really got started.  I think he lied because he wanted more power, and thought the people would believe him since he was supposed to be one of the main people they'd trust.

===message:Well, lets see whats wrong with dishonesty.  I guess since he is the president he shouldn't be perceived as trustworthy.  The fact of the matter is that it made the US look like a joke to other countries.  What the president does has a direct affect on the US.
