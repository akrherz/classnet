===message:I disagree.  I don’t think the South or North would have fallen for a judgment that all men were created equal. The Northerners didn’t like slavery, however they also did not feel the blacks were equal to whites.  I think this kind of judgment would have continued to cause fighting.

===message:<P>I don't think that ANY supreme court would have rules slavery unconstitutional at the time. Slavery was provided for by the Constitution. It took an ammendment to remove that portion of the document. Frankly, I was dissapointed by the one sidedness of the readings. True slavery was a huge issue, but it was one of MANY problems in Northern/Southern relations and eventual secession. Probably the biggest reason for secession was the federal government being used devisively for Northern interests.</p>
<p>If you study the content of the CSA's constitution, it is almost an exact copy of the US constitution. Complete with the 12 ammendments the US constitution had at the time. There was, however, one key diference. Where the US constition left room for interpretation of "implied powers", the CSA's specificly limited the power of the federal government to its original US constitutional powers. The only other main difference was that the president had line-item veto powers.</P>
<P>This just goes to show the feelings of Southerners. The tariffs enacted by the federal government to protect buddying Northern industrialism were paid largely (about 85% of them) by the South. While they were taxed to death, the Northern industrial interests were protected. You can also see the Southerners question of a North that openly opposed slavery as an evil enterprise, yet had no problem building their business off slave money. I think, in retrospect, we all know that slavery was wrong and in the 1860's very unpopular in world opinion. However, the reading's assumptions that the entire conflict orginated and centered around the spread of slavery is simply not accurate.</p>

===message:Two thoughts. First, Chris great points. Very little time was given to any of the other issues in the readings. Second. If Dread Scott had gone the other way I don’t see how that might have resolved the issue. I tend to think that such a ruling might in fact may have forced secession even earlier. This was a no compromise issue to the southern aristocracy. To give up slavery in any real measure was to give up their way of life. I just don’t see a people who see nothing wrong with the institution letting go with out a fight. Just as a side note relating to Chris’s point most southern whites were not slave owners but were dirt poor. These people fought not so much for slavery but for the other issues that faced the south. Then again I could be all-wrong.

===message:A ruling as you mentioned in my opinion would have accelerated the events leading to the south braking away from the union.  There may have been a few states who remained but for the most part I feel that the cofederate states would not accept that ruling that slavery was unconstitution because you have to understand the thinking of slave owners.  Slaves were not viewed as people they were considered property.  With that in mind I can not see the confederate states accpeting this as the law.
