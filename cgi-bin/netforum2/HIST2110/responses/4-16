===message:I agree, how could the North and South avoid war when one exist slavery and the other exist free soil. Then there was issues on other states if they were going to be free soil or slavery states.

===message:  There are always two sides to every story and this is just a prime example. Both Seward and Lincoln were correct in suggesting that conflict and disunion over the issue of slavery issue were unavoidable.  There was no peaceful solution as long as there were free slaves.  I agree that  slavery was such a controversial topic that it would not have made much difference whether the nation was led by moderates or fanatics.

===message:People in both the North and South were prejudice against blacks, but for slightly different reasons.  The South needed them as slave labor in order to maintain their aristocratic lifestyles, while the North was afraid that freed slaves would migrate north and compete for low paying jobs in the big cities.  Several states that didn't want slavery, also didn't want freed slaves to be allowed into the state.  Neither side really viewed blacks as equal to whites even though they had opposite views on slavery.

===message:There are two sides to every story and with this a compromise is sometime hard to come by. Both sides were wrong and the only way out was war. 
Being that the use for slaves was different in both of this places that is why a compromise was inevitable
