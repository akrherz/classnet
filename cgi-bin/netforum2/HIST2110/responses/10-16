===message:Though many women did return to the homes the women workforce increased during this period.  A new sense of pride did derive from the women who held jobs and took care of the family while thier husbands were at war.  The female in the workplace increased to more after the war.  I think that televesion only mirrored a small portion of the womens lives.   Which is supported by the fact that more women did join the workforce after the war.

===message:I disagree; when you say women were better off in the 1950s because they had men to depend on and “bring home the bacon”. Today you can still find men who wants to take care of their women, girl friend etch; and men who are taking care of their family. Women have came a long way; from taking care of the family, having a right to voter, and being able to have a career and family at the same time. We are not better off in the 1950s!

===message:I to think that a women had it better in the 50’s.  Just like you mentioned, "they had men that wanted to take care of the family and "bring home the bacon."  Men back then believed in taking care of home.   For the most part, a women has to play both roles in this so call new century.  The perfect housewife (single mom), and bring home the bacon.   I also think that more women are making more money these days!!! Some women will lie about how much they make, just  to keep peace.
