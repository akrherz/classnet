===message:Lindsay, I agree.  Each new Presidency has to deal with the continued problems of the one before.  I feel that the success/failure of a Presidency is truly not shown until the aftermath!  If one President solves one issue without paying attention to another, the next President has to work on solving the ladder and continue with the success or improve the first.

===message:You are incredibly thorough, if you are not a history major, you should be!  I agree with your statements about past presidencies and like the clever usage of the stepmother analogy.  Also, I believe that each president has left at least one mistake that future generations always bear the burden.

===message:<p>I agree with Lindsay's statements for the most part. Although I do think Reagan was largely a figurehead in his administration. I credit his domestic fiscal as his own baby, but I think most of the foreign policy was dictated by the republican's neoconservative power base. They wanted to take a much more agressive stance against the Soviets and were far more willing to play power politics than previous administrations. I'm not saying this was a bad thing, it's apparent to me that this policy accelerated the end of the cold war.</p>
<p>Then again, alot of the global conflicts were are embroiled in (both cold and hot) are a direct result of American power politics in the 80's. Alot of people like to say that we "put Sadam Hussein in power", but that isn't true. We did provide alot of indirect aid to his regime because they were fighting the funamentalist Iranians. No one at the time was thinking about building a threat in Hussein, the only true military threat was the Communist Bloc. However we did greatly increase his power in the region. In Afgahnistan we armed militia guerilla fighters to push the Soviets out, but we didn't care about the fallout and power vaccuum it left... as long as it wasn't filled by the Soviets. We supported and emboldened the Israelis to forsake large portions of the peace accords they signed. They were aligned toward us, while Syria and other states in the region were in danger of being further aligned toward the Soviets.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be over critical of Reagan and his regime. It was a different political landscape then, and, when playing power politics, weaker nations can be used as pawns for a greater goal. I don't think neoconservatives could have ever forseen how different the world would be right now. However, we need to look toward our history when confronting our enemies. It is rare that any nation has an enemy they didn't earn, and we are no diferent. The tough part is figuring out how to defeat your enemies, whether on the battlefield or in the diplomatic arena, without breeding more hatreds for the next generation to deal with.</p>
<p>Now that I've roamed completely off topic, I'll adress Lindsay's small comment that deserved a little more emphasis: "Racial issues". There is a real travesty in this country when it comes to dealing with racial and ethnic issues. After the 60's and the great strides made judicialy to ensure the recognition of minority rights, the great citizen movements to change social perceptions, and willingness of Blacks and Whites to see that there was a problem and it was realy both parties problem, the ball wasn't just dropped, it was stolen.</p>
<p>Hijacked is a better word. The entire movement was hijacked from all sides. Politicions now use racism to try to discredit oponents who may not favor a pork program that would statistcaly benifit a minority race more than others. Race Warriors shakedown corperations who are afraid of the horrible publicity of a racial lawsuit. The media jumps on the bandwagon looking for a racial angle in everything, because sensationalism sells. Everything from politics to commerical products are marketed by race. We've created a culture obsessed with catering to each group that we've forgotten the concept of unity. And the guilty parties are on all sides</p>
<p>In the meantime real issues in our society get worse. This is the climate that makes racial divisions grow. Even in our readings, they take time to seperate issues as they pertain to groups. How much voluntary segregation is there now? Blacks fought and actualy died in the civil rights movement, and now the Jacksons and Sharptons in the Race Warrior camp perpetuate racial mistrust. What happens when enterprising Latino demagogues get the same great idea? Are we all just going to move into our own neighborhoods so we can't be descrimated against?</p>
<p>This probably sounds pretty harsh, but I see it as a real issue that most people are afraid to confront. Why? Because you'll be called a racist. Racial tensions have become devisive. There is a vested interest in Washington and in the Race Warrior organization to never end this. It would be too costly. Democrats have the "black vote" and actualy market in that direction. They use racial predjudices to garner votes! Republicans in the South use cute language to play to paranoid whites and general without actualy saying, "Let's stop those crazy negros". It's absurd! I was raised in the South so I can see it first hand in others and myself. In the north it's different... most of the cities have been racialy segregated in little districts and neighborhoods for generations, so the racism isn't always in your face, but it's still there. We need a real grassroots effort to squash this stuff, or it's going to get worse.</p>
<p>Legislation can't fix it. Affirmative action is just another race baiting vote getter in my mind. It would never fix the underlying problem and probably make it worse. Sitting around and denying there is any real racism any more won't make it go away either. I just spent the day having to explain to a doctor that I don't have medical insurance, but that I do pay my bills. I offered to pre-pay the first few visits before he took me on a payment plan basis. He was thrilled, cash is way better than insurance for him and even gave me a 10% discount off the cost an insurance company would pay. When the insurance refuses to pay they rarely get anything from the patient, plus when they do pay it takes forever. Cash is now... Why am I relating this? Because my chicana wife went there last week and the doctor refused to see my kid. She's Mexican so she's going to freeload. Sure she's got money right now, but once she gets trusted she'll rip us off. Of course, I called him a racist idiot and told him he lost my business. Will it change anything? Probably not. What it's going to take is a real understanding of what is going on on all of our parts. Blacks need to realize that their "leaders" are exploiting them for profit and playing on their frustration. The white man isn't holding a poor innercity majority black neighborhood down any more than Mexicans are stealing all the jobs from white blue collar workers. It's racial paranoia. We need to accept our lives as the product of our actions or inactions. We need to see a person what he is and not the color of his skin, the language he was born speaking, or the God he prays to. We're all guilty, and we can't point fingers at who's responsibility it is.</p>
<p>I appologize for the length of this and anyone who reads something into it that isn't there.. and even people who are going to be offended because a white guy dared speak of the unspeakable. Having my wife discrimated against, or my children, or even myself angers me to no end. Having some redneck tell me races weren't meant to mix and a bi-racial marriage is "unholy" only to say "I didn't mean Mexicans" when I inform that my wife is indeed one, makes me realize what blacks see when they look at me. We need real leaders to step up and confront the problem rather than profiteering or exploiting it. That's the end of my rant :)</p>

===message:Appologies for the rant... after I posted it, I reread and wanted to edit badly. Unfortunately the feature is not there, and I had to live with my half thought out words. Like I stated to begin with, I was angry when I posted. Like most words spoken without thought, they came out not exactly as I had intenended, but thank you for agreeing with the general point I was trying to make, even if it was off topic.

===message:Lindsay,

with regard to racial issues and sexist issues, what is your expectation as to when things will change?  I agree "nothing can be changed overnight" but we have been studying history from the 1700s to the present.  Although strides have been made by women and minorities, we still do not all get along as Americans.  I know this is an individual issue, not a President issue, and will require readjustments and determination by each individual to make a difference.  Will we see this in our lifetime?

===message:Chris, the one thing I admire about you is your honesty and straightforwardness. No need to apologize for expressing how you feel about certain matters.  However, I think not just black leaders but all leaders (politically and religiously) have profited and exploited all races.  And, I hope you do realize that there are many influential black leaders:  Richard Parsons (CEO AOL-Time Warner, Inc.), Roderick Paige (U.S. Secretary of Education), John W. Boyd Jr. (President of the National Black Farmers Association), Colin Powell (Secretary of State), Bishop Wilton Gregory, Kenneth Chenault (CEO American Express Corp.), many mayors and U.S. Representatives and others.  The one person I have always admired was Thurgood Marshall.  Thurgood felt that Dr. King's nonviolent movement was not making a difference and Malcolm X's way of addressing issues did more harm than good.  But Thurgood worked through the courts to bring to light and destroy the racist segregation system of Jim Crow (Brown v. Board of Education).  I recently heard a legislator say with regard to the flag issue that he did not see why there is such a debate because if the confederate flag was so bad, why didn't blacks speak up in the 1940/1950s. Did he not realize that lynching was still going on during the 1950s (14 year old Emmett Till of Chicago was dragged from his bed and lynched in Mississippi while visiting relatives in the summer of 1955)?

===message:I honestly do not think that our society will see complete acceptance by all races and by both sexes in this lifetime.  You're right, this is something that we as a country have been striving to deal with since the 1700's and although we are a much better nation now than ever before, there are still traditions and morals being passed down from some of our older generations who still do not accept such integration of all people.  I do believe that our children and grandchildren will see an even better nation than us.
