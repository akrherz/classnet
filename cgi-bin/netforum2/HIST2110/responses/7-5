===message:You are right that the propaganda forms that the government utilized were effective.  They were effective in securing Americans support of the war.  By using this propaganda and gaining the support of Americans for the war, the government was given food and the necessary items needed for supporting the soldiers in the field with both food and materials.  Without the use of such things as “war gardens” or “meatless Tuesdays”, the war effort put on by the United States may not have been a success.   After all, America’s involvement in the war helped not only Americans overseas, but also the soldiers of other countries overseas.  I agree with you also that the war would have taken place had someone disagreed with the war.  America was protecting itself, helping the Allied countries; they protected economical interests, security interests, and social interests.
