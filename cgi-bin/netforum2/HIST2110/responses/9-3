===message:Kathryn, good points.  The trouble I have with McCarthyism is that it did not produce any evidence, just accusations that ruined reputations.  Imagine, as in the case of the actions of the loyalty board, being told you were fired although there is not one piece of evidence to support the charges of disloyalty.  Why do people fail to think rational?  Is it due to fear or is it easier to "follow the crowd?"

===message:Carla, I agree with you.  There was no evidence to support McCarthy’s accusations and he apparently kept changing his speeches and accusations to appeal to the public!  It is easier to follow than to lead and to lead would mean to be rational!
