===message:Good points and I agree with you.  I find it ironic how our government during World War I felt that any one who did not support the war was a friend of the opponent and yet today it has found that some of our political campaigns are being financed by contributions from an "opponent."  Also, it was easy for the government to gain control of immigrants because they desparately wanted to start a new life in America and would have pledge allegiance to anything to stay here.

===message:Linsay, I hope that a repetitive, episodic, renditon of the Wilsonian period does not rear its' ugly head again. The outcome of these uncertain times remains to be seen regarding the freedom of speech,or being an antiwar advocate.There are many ways a person can be hung other than having a physical rope around their neck. No one wants to become an  "Enemy Of The State".
