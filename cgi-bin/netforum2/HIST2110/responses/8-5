===message:Your answer was phrased.  Do you feel that this war may have been prevented if Hitler was not given Sudentland.  Ultimately this land gave him a strategic advantage to launch attacks and gave him a huge following of supporters.  Maybe if Campbell did not cave in initially things would have been different.

===message:I am not sure what you mean by phrased.  However, you posed a good question.  Hitler was bent on expansion.  What I meant by my statement was that if Hitler would have been confronted immediately and not passified, then the war in Europe would have been kept on a smaller scale.  As you pointed out, the Sudentland gave Hitler an advantage.  This advantage came not only from its positioning, but also from the idea that if confronted, Britain and the other European countries would bend to whatever wills Hitler had.  By no means am I predicting that the war would not have happened if Hitler would not have been pacified, but I do think that the war could have been put on a smaller scale, thus restricting the scale of the war.  I hope that answers your question.  Please, tell me what you meant by "phrased" and what you think of my answer.  Thank you for your reply and the quality of your reply.

===message:Please disregared that first statment I started and idea but changed it but I forgot to delet the opening i was going to use.  You answered my question thanks I have a better understanding of your original answer.  I just feel that radicals like Hitler can not be appeased.  they are like a consuming fire that must be dealt with immediately before they rage out of control.  I agree with you that it may have still been a conflict but on a smaller scale.  At least he would not have that strategic position and the huge following if he was not given Sudentland.

===message:<p>These are great points and shed an incredible amount of light on the US's role in today's world. The US dominance in post WWII Europe allowed Western Europe to focus on issues other than military developement. The US was there to prevent the spread of Communist aggression, and the Europeans formed the first real European peace in history. I think it would be interesting to see what a turn-of-the-century Frenchman or Englishman would have thought of a European Union. It would have been a joke. I think that war is avoidable by a nation only if it is sheltered by another. A weak nation is doomed to be on the recieving end of power politics and a strong nation will be drawn into conflict by a competing power. Today the US has asserted a unipolar influence on the world and our allies enjoy peace and disdain military force because of our protection.</p>
<p>Isolationism is very appealing. If the US pulled back it's massive global forces it would just open the door for another power to make a grab for dominance. While we could possibly remove ourselves from constant police actions and war, we would either end up alligned against a powerfull adversary or submitting to another nation for protection.</p>

===message:I agree with most of what you are saying, but do you really think that Japan would not have made a move on the U.S. even if it did not have treaties with Italy and Germany.  These treaties gave political alliance, and were supposed to give mutual defense, but Japan appears to have not really needed help until the very end.  Their attack on Pearl Harbour was their's alone without the help of Germany and Italy who were otherwise occupied.
