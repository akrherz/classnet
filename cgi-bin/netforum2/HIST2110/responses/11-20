===message:I agree that these groups helped to unite their culture.  I also feel that had all three groups united as one front they could have been powerful.  They could have still generated pride for themselves as people who were due respect and rights and they would have generated more publicitiy joined together.  I think that by setting themselves aside from each other, they harmed their cause.  There is power in numbers!

===message:Although strength is in numbers, each group had to fight their own battles on their own terms. All three groups did want the same equality, but each group had to be recognized individually as a class of people. If they would have joined as one the United States would have placed them as one group (minorities)and would have minimized each class of struggles.
