===message:no.  let's take the popular assumption that Bush just want's the oil that Iraq has to offer.  If we were wanting to take over another country to get its oil, why choose Iraq?  Why choose a country in the middle of a region full of extremists and terrorists that profess hatred for America and view it as a blessing to die killing them.  If that were Bush's reason for going to war, why not take over one of the countries of South America.  We could get all of our oil needs from one of these countries and not have to deal with as much resistance and religious terrorists.  i do not think that Bush is perfect but i do not believe that he is trying to achieve personal goals.

===message:I must agree with Mr. Tisdale, I do not think that the Iraq situation is based upon personal goals.  President Bush is the total focus of not only our nation, but every nation in the world.  Every step he makes is critiqued and picked apart.  For a President to use the government for personal gain he would have to pick a less public venue.

===message:yes that is true. so many people feel that bush is fighting to fulfill his dad's footsteps and that this is his sole purpose. and so many others feel that bush's purpose is far more grand than that. thanks for your opinion brenda!!
