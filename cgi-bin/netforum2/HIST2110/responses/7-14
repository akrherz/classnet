===message:I agree that whether we support our government or not, they are gong to do what they "feel" best.  I think we are dreaming about some of our elected officials!  I think that more than half of them have no idea what they are doing and could care less about what the public thinks, they only seem to care about whether they look good in the eyes of the people!  Which obviously most don't!

===message:It's true about how you mentioned a war would still occur regardless as to what the anti-supporters thought or said.  I too believe the officials our country elected are capable of making the best decision for our country and people, and that these officials know what they're doing.

===message:I agree that the war would have occured with or without the support of the American public, but without their support it would have been harder to rally troops and supplies.  It is hard for a government to move ahead in wars without the support of the majority of the public.
