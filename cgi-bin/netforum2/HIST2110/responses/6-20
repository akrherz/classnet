===message:I agree with your assesment of the success/failure of Reconstruction.  However, I think one of the limiting factors was that there were several groups with conflicting ideas on how Reconstruction should be handled, and these differences kept it from getting the support it needed to succeed.  If any of the plans for Reconstruction could have gotten large-scale support it might have been successful.
