===message:I agree with most of your statement.  I don’t think Reconstruction was a total success.  The original goals, although not totally clear with ever changing politics, were not all totally met.  I felt the biggest success was the readmission of the Confederate states not the amendments because, like you explained, they were not enforced or followed through with.  I had not thought about the fall of the Republicans being linked with the diminishing thoughts of Reconstruction.

===message:Interesting.  I did not think about the goal of admitting the states back into the union. That was very good.  I chose the admendments because I thought that these admentdments, while not enforced then, served the good of America later on.  Like I said, I did not think of the readmission of the states, and I am glad you brought that up.  Along those lines, who did you agre with most on their methods of readmission?
