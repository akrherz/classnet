===message:Is it amazing how tv depicted this time period.  These were the same television shows that lead us to believe that married couples slept in separate twin sized beds.  I see your point about how women believed that they were better off back then.

===message:yes i see your point too. back then times may have been great to them. if women of the past could have forseen our present day they would have been appauled at the intensity and the rate of crime being committed against women such as rape. they didn't really have this worry AS MUCH back then.
