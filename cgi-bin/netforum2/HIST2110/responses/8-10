===message:Your last sentence is so true.  It is so hard to know how to respond to any critic issues when the information can be conscrued so that it looks the way a group wants it to look.  Can we ever handled this problem in an unbiasd, diplomatic way?  Is this some of the World War I tactics, where they control the way you feel about an issue by force feeding you their beliefs?
