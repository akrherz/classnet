===message:Your first sentence is so true.  Although many people really don't understand why war is taking place they still tend to fear.  I believe the same thing about the duck tape and plastic sheeting, how would you actually know when it's about to take place.  A lot of people rely on what everyone else is saying, but mostly all of it is gossip.  These people don't really know what's going on foreal.  Americans are good at overhearing things and exagerating the truth.  And this leads to all the confusion.

===message:I like your thoughts about the precautionary steps in the event of a gas attack.  This can be traced back to the backyard bomb shelter days of the 1950s.  How would these people ever know when to get into the bomb shelter?  There is no way the government would have warned the population of a nuclear attack, because any areas not affected would fall into chaos and anarchy.  No need to scare the population if there isn't anything that can be done to protect them.
