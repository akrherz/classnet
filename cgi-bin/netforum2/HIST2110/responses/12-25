===message:I agree with your argument.  I don't understand why a lot of people passed so many judgements about what Clinton had done and not the others.  They act as though no other president had done the same thing, when there were probably ones more worse than him.  It is true how these people don't really know what the other presidents had done while their term was in process, because he was the only one to get caught, and none of them did.  He was a good president, but by him getting caught turned many people against him.  I really can't see how people can say anything about his personal life, because he is human just like the rest of us, and just because he was the president doesn't mean he had to be perfect.
