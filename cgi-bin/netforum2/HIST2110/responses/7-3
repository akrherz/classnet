===message:I agree with you Kevin.  Unfortunately, just as propaganda during World War I influenced Americans to hate and be hostile toward Germans, after 9/11/01 the media industry played a big part in influencing the hatred toward individuals of middle eastern descent.  Some people are easily led and do not think on their own.

===message:Kevin, It is sad to say, unfortunately, that the very things this government was suppose to have been built upon has never in reality ever taken place for many. If you are not Anglo-English descent sooner or later there will be some type of conflict. The media has to participate in factionalism in order to stay in good standing with the powers that be.If we look at historical events from the beginning of warring between people it has aways been about taking something that belongs to the opposing person(people)rightfully. Civil liberties for the original inhabitants of America,and those bought to America against their will,has never experience equality that others have. Even though they have fought in every war that ever have taken place for this government, with all the prejudicial,inhuman,horrid,exploitation acts against them. They only tried to be apart of this so-called democracy that represents freedom and justice for all. It is unfair to say they gave up their civil liberties for protection,or deserves neither.The bottom line is, if you got the guns you got the power.Government does what it wants to do, no matter if it is pre,during,or post war it makes no difference.The word GOVERNMENT means just what it says be it good or bad.
