===message:I disagree with your statement about the groups being more divisive because they were separated because first you have to be able to work within your own group before you go forth and try to work as a group. When you can come together as one amongst yourselves only then can you accomplish positive acts that will benefit the whole group and not just a couple of people in the group.
