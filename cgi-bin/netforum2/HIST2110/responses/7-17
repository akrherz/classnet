As a society, we depend on the media to keep us up-to-date with the world events. If you haven't done your research, you could very well believe everything that is presented to you. That is why, it is important, as an individual to excercise your rights, to search and to acquire knowledge about any given situation. For some of us, involvement in world affairs only becomes an interest when it hits close to home.

===message:The media have so much influence on the American people that is why there should be some restrictions on certain issues. I think everyone has a right to express and voice their opinion, but if their views will bring conflict and confusing to the cause their should be restrictions on others views. If we are at war we need to unity and come together and not separated  because we are all Americans and the outcome effect all of us at the end.
