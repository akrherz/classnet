===message:I agree with your answer, especially about the Native Americans.  I don't really see how the Red Power movement had any success.  I too believe their movement has not yet even started.  They are still kind of being taken advantage by the government, and I think they might take some kind of action in the future sometime, because of how fed up they will be with everything.  Something is bound to happen.  I'm also a firm believer that nonviolence is the way to go, because in the end the ones who did't turn to violence are the ones who are the bigger people, because they didn't stoop to such a low level in order to deal with certain things.
