===message:Following the 9/11 attacks, propaganda was and has been used very effectively by the US.  All of the songs, memorials, commercials and political speeches that have been given in response to the attacks are forms of propaganda.  They have united the country around a common cause and made many Americans realize what it means to live in this great country.

===message:Propaganda is used as a tool by such nations as Iraq and I believe that if he were aloud to speak his ideas of anti-americanism abroad that the effects would be deadly.  I do see the effects on civil liberties but I must question the fact that we must protect ourselves, our interests and our countries safety.  If it means that certain civil rights are taken in order to provide us with this safety then I am willing to accept that because it is still the best country in the world.  Some may have to sacrifice for the benefit of the whole.
