===message:I agree with you discussion, but I have one question.  You stated that "the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor led to the U.S. counterattack using the A-bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki."  Does this mean that the use of the A-bomb was because of the attack on Pearl Harbor, or does this mean that the U.S use of the A-bomb was just a part of the U.S. attack?  Could the attack on Pearl Harbor have been a factor in the U.S. descion to use the A-bomb.  Not that it was the only reason, but that maybe it was a lingering issue that helped tip the scales.  Thank you for your reply.
