===message:I agree Tawanna, but Clinton's situation did affect American's when he decided to lie.  I really don't care who he sleeps with, like you said that is between he and his wife.  The problem is that once he was asked about it, stemming from allegations from that other women of harrassment, he should have answered truthfully and faced the conciquences.  He would not be reelected (which he wasn't anyway), but it would have benn over.  By denying the facts, we were taken through a lot of wasted time and money, because others doing the same thing needed to point a moral finger.

===message:I disagree because I feel that he lied because it was his personal business. I also feel that if he could have been he would have been reelected into office as president because he did run this country. Yes a lot of money and time was wasted on this issue by moral pointers that were doing the same thing. Only because some dress keeping unclean woman wanted to make allegations shows she too had an underlying scandal in the works believe me Clinton was not and still not the only person in the White House that has done that and he want be the last. Clinton got caught but did anyone ask Monica why she kept that dress?

===message:Tawana, there are some good points you made about how Nixon affected the country and Clinton only had a conflict with his wife. The way we view our President is only our opinion on how we see him. We can agree or disagree with he.

===message:Good point, Lorena!  What kind of sicko keeps a dress that has that kind of evidence on it?  I'll agree that Monica must have been up to something from the very get-go.  Although that still does not make Mr. Clinton right for what he did, I believe it was a personal issue between he and his wife and should have never reached the level that it did.
