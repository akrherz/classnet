===message:Until you said that i too believed that women made less money than men.  my Sosc teacher brings up this "fact" all of the time.  i know that you can find statistics to support anything but i really thought that it was an established fact that women generally make less than men.  do you know of any lawsuits where a woman sued an institution in order to get equal pay?  that would be interesting to know.

===message:To name a few:  Miranda v. B & B Cash Grocery Store, Inc., Arizona Governing Committee for Tax Deferred Annuity & Deferred Compensation Plans v. Norris, and Washington County v. Gunther.  And you're right, the general feeling is that women make less than men because that is what history tells us.  Luckily, we are in the 21st Century and there are laws protecting against such discrimination.  It may be true that it still occurs, but I feel like it's up to the victim to make a change.

===message:You might want to review Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act.  There are laws that protect against this type of discrimination and if it is currently happening to you as defined by law, you may have a suit.  It's illegal and if it does happen, it's up to the victim to change things.
