===message:I also have to agree.  The U.S. has been such a powerful country since the Civil War.  We live in a country with so many more opportunities and freedoms than a lot of other countries and the end of the Civil War was just the beginning for many of these opportunities. I also agree that if the war had never occured, this nation could have destroyed itself, so therefore, although the war brought a lot of suffering, it brought many good things to this country as well.
