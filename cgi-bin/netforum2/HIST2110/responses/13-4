===message:Kevin, you are correct regarding everything you said especially about former President Carter. To me he is still the most honorable president so far our country has ever had. Unfortunately he was a victim of circumstances. He is still profound in his everyday life. Like you, defining better off depends on how one looks at the over-all picture, and who is benefiting from the spoils of war,certainly not the common working class.

===message:Permenant solutions are probably not always a reality, but they are there.  I also think that Carter could be considered  a “bridge” in political life.  He provided no real solutions to America’s woes, but he did gain trust from many Americans.  This was a good point.  I never thought of it like that.  I also think that Americans are better off, I have to disagree with you in your statement that presidents have not played a role in this.  Though some presidents di not play a role in making American life beter, some did.  (For example, Abraham Lincoln’s emancipation of slaves and Roosevelt’s New Deal programs)

===message:Kevin,
President Carter was one of our greatest presidents. He had a passion for helping the common man and taking care of the country. He was a victim of circumstance with the hostage situation, which could be argued that he lost the reelection bid. But President Regans economic plan helped the business portion of our country, but it left many of the working class behind. It allowed the rich to get richer and the poor to become poorer.
