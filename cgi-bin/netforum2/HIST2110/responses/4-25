===message:I don't believe that moderation would have worked in this case.  What could be a peaceful, moderate solution?  The north wanted to abolish slavery for its own reasons (and very few of them were noble) and the south thought slavery to be quite necessary. Slavery was an issue that was not a "moderate" issue and couldn't be decided. How much middle ground is there between "I need to own these workers" and "Slavery is both evil and wrong"? I believe that the country was doomed to conflict regarding the issue of slavery.
