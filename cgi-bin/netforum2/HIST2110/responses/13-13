===message:You made a good point in stating that during the Reagan administration, people began to become self-centered and thought more about themselves.  The rich did get richer and did not consider the way the poor were living.  The poor and the minorities are the ones who suffered during this time while the "yuppies" continued to prosper since they had better living conditions and better opportunities.  I agree with you when you stated that today, we have a better entreperneurship arena.  We have a lot more choices in the workfield and there are a lot more opportunities with home businesses and the use of computers.  But, the poor and some minorities, such as Mexican-American's and Native American's are still oppressed and do not have the same opportunities.  So I don't think the conditions of the poor and some minorities are better than they were before.  I think they are the same.  Unfortunatly, I think the war on poverty always exist.
