===message:I do not feel the British were trying to create tyranny.  I feel that the majority of their decisions were stemmed from the pressure they were feeling from the British citizens.  They were going through a recession brought on by the debt of the war.  Unfortunenately no one considered this before aggreeing to cover the expenses for the war.  The quick fix solution was to tax the Americans heavily in order to make up for what was lost.  The Americans did not aggree so therefore begins the process of them seeking independance.

===message:You have some good points and I agree with them.  Although the British government may have thought it was reasonable that the American colonies help with the national debt, they failed to realized that laws and policies are to benefit all citizens.  The colonies soon realized that the British government policies were wrong and burdensome, which eventually lead to the colonies requesting separation.
