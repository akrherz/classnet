===message:To think that two groups that shared different veiws of this magnitude could resolve their various issues seems a bit impossible.  Both sides had their own views of the situations and had their reasonings as to why they felt the way they did.  Slavery in a nut shell was bad for all those involved.  It tarnished the lives of all involved, inclusing those against slavery.  Imagine living daily with a cause to abolish slavery and hundreds or thousands of people are against you?  Both sides had suffer, though the slaves suffered more.  I think there would be a big difference in our lives today if slavery had not been abolished.  None of our lives would be the same and many of us probably would not be here!

===message:I agree, this debate was too big for the North and the South to come to an agreement peacefully.  I hadn't thought about how little of control the politicians and government may have had on this issue.  So you brought that to my attention.

===message:Yes, both were right because the issue of slavery would have continued to haunt the country and cause further seperation. No, a peaceful nonpartisan solution would have not been possible because there would have been further uprisings. Yes, a policy of moderation was doomed to fail because the Northerners wanted slavery to end immediately whereas the Southerners wanted slavery to continue indefinately. If the country were ran by moderates, slavery could have continued well into the 19th century, and the fanatics almost immediately ended a very blemished era in American history.

===message:idon't think there would be much of a difference had the moderates or fanatics been in charge. there is always a way of a peaceful partison. what seemed impossible was getting people to open their eyes and establish an effective way of going about it.

===message:I am not saying that slavery is right.  But, the south was mainly reliant on the agricultural industry.  Their state of mind was that they couldn't survive without slaves.  I admit that they were ignorant for thinking this.  But, they were used to treating the slaves like crap and reaping all of the benefits.  Some things like this go on today.  Like paying people $.05 an hour to make Nike shoes.
