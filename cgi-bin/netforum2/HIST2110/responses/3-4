===message:You have some very strong points in your argument.  I think you may be overlooking the results of what would happen if the states governed them selves.  There would probably be a war every other month.  Just try to imagine the impact on the economy if every state coined there own money.  Allowing the states to govern themselves would yield a catastrophic outcome.

===message:I definitely agree with you!  I had not considered the lack of communication available; I just would want a guarantee!  With the incidents of the past (implementation of taxes for the benefit of something or someone else)I would have been uneasy about ratifying something that sounded so similar!

===message:A "war every month" is a little presumptous, but you could very well be right.  True, the coining of money and many other things could have been very burdensome to the states under a Antifederalist's government.  However, it is the garentee of these rights that leads me to this side the most.  The rights of citizen's would gain my support.  You are correct; there would be many hurrdles to overcome if this government was founded.  Thank you for your reply.
