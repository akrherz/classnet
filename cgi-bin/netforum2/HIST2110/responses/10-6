===message:Ursula, let's hope the tides change.  There has been a great deal of change up until this point, obviously!  I totally agree with being better off now than then!  If my life was in the 1950's I would still be in a miserable marriage that kept my self worth below zero!!!!!

===message:"The tides will change?"  That seems analagous to the epitaph of the Ole Confederacy: "The south shall rise again."  What tides need to change?  What will these changes bring?  A matriarchal society?  Would you prefer that men stay home and women work? It seems to me that there are laws now that promote gender equality.  What more is there?  Maybe membership in Augusta.  what would that accomplish?  besides there are plenty of institutions that are women-only.  will you explain to me what these tides are?

===message:Kristi, you are right, there has been change.  I don't want to take anything away from the women who worked and fought hard to make the legal changes that have given us the right to be students at Clayton State majoring in what we want to and pursuing our goals.  The problem is the same as with racism.  Legal changes are great and open the doors, but if the heart is not changed, even the gains can bring us sadness and dispair.
