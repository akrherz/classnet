===message:Hey Al You had mentioned in your post

"They {Radical republicans} wanted the freedman to recieve something for the many years of slavery that was indured but many then felt that that was not warranted. " I don't think I caught that in the chapter. Are you talking about the redistribution of lands to former slaves handled by the freedmans bureau? Thanks.

===message:No not just land if you really read the chapter!  The freedman only was allowed to do the things that benefited politics.  Many were just as lost with freedom without the slavery.  It took many years to get a 1/3 of the rights that was promised through reconstruction.  The real question that you should ask yourself is what did they get for the many years of bondage?  The Southern leaders returned to thier wealth thier power and political structure.  Yes they did have to rebuild the south but still where able to benefit from the war more than former slaves or poor whites!
