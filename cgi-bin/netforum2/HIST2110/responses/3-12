===message:Although our government seems the fairest to us compared to others, it is by not means perfect.  Some of the fears of the Anti-Federalist came true.  Why is it that those in the Senate are so wealthy and receive the perks that they do.  Is that fair to the person who is making minimum wage.  Is our government truly representative of our society.  How may women are minorities are represented and for how long have they been a part of our government.  The Constitution is very open to interpretation like the law and the Bible.  Who gets to interpret it becomes the issue.  The Anti-Federalist were right to be cautious.  Their main concern was that this new form of Government would not work and either state or national government would dominate and the people would suffer.  Remember, the Anti-Federalist pushed for the Bill of Rights to be added.  Without it, how much freedom from government rule do you think we would really have?

===message:You are correct when you say that a weak national government would have left America open to foreign attack, especially by Britain.  Even with the national government, Britain did attack us and we defeated them in the War of 1812 (1812-1814).  If America didn't have a national government, even the infant one that they had at the time, they most likely wouldn't have been able to defend themselves as well.  The states would have squabbled amongst themselves until it was too late to mount a decent defense.

===message:I really liked the point you made as well. In my response I called the Federalists visionaries, because they realized that in order to move forward and become the great nation that we have become, they would have to be organized and unified.  The creation of centralized government served not only the purpose intended, but in addition as you stated strengthened us both internally and externally from future attacks by Great Britain and other countries.

===message:I agree, our national government was the only solution to providing a unified front to the rest of the world.  It seems like it took alot of courage to come to a new world and try to become an independent nation.  It is true that our leaders appear to be powerful and wealthly... but all countries have elites and masses, that's what makes leaders and followers.
