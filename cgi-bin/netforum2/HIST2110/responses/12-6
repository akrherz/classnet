===message:Kristi, I agree and disagree.  It really depends on what side of the fence you are from on the trusting of government.  I have never trusted the office of the presidency because of the so many powerful people who surround the President.  I think in the early presidency due to many things it was a little more trusting but from Roosevelt on I think somewhere we formed a figurehead more that a leader.  Water Gate I feel was desighned to get President Nixon out of thier.  Now just think about who found what and where.  Who put it in thier and how easily it was detected.  Your personal feelings about Clinton are admirable but you have to admit we had some good years under the administration.  And as for his pittfalls he is just the one who got caught.

===message:I can't say that I totally agree with you about the respect of the president depending on his morals because when you vote do you really know his morals? In my opinion Americans really vote for the one that they think is doing the less lying and of course agreeing with the some of the same issues as his/her self. And yes there are a lot of things that is going on in government that we as Americans don't know about.

===message:I agree, I feel that you can respect the President if you chose to, but it not something you have to do.  The President is just another human if he wants respect he has to earn respect. There are people who don’t  respect Bush, but that’s their opinion on why they don’t respect him.
