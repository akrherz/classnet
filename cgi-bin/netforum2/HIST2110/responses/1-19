===message:I agree with that both sides had legitimate claims but I do not believe that entirely the problem was that Britian made laws without the Americans. However I do believe the Americans felt that they were not heard or seen as a real part of the big picture. I believe they felt that laws were being made/ changed behind thier backs like the British had something to hide therefor trying to have total contol in a underhanded way.

===message:Again, we must review the reason that sparked the bloody feud. Losing a costly war to England was the primary reason for the misunderstanding. The British had to come up with some kind of plan to restore the revenue. The British figure that since the colonies were protected from any danger from their allies and that the American’s (some of them that acquire the status), were comfortable with the British lifestyle and customs, that reaction to the taxable acts would be little to none. But they were wrong. The American’s felt that taxing the colonies without any representation in Parliament was wrong. I also have to agree with you, the British acts were underhanded and cruel.
