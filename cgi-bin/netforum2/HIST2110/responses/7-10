===message:Follow the leader is a game most often played in the early educational years; however, this game follows many people throughout their life as their way of thinking.  Unfortunately, the crowd is not always the group to follow.  The United States use of propaganda and repression demonstrated a follow the leader type control.  Many Americans did not know what to think of the war, but the government gave them one side to look at and no other side.  This helped their cause.  Everyone felt the emotions of 9-11-01.  Whether the citizens saw war a necessary action or not did not matter.  America was attacked, and if such actions were allowed to happen, then America’s aggressors would have won and may have continued.  The American government used logic and common sense to see retaliation as a rational means.

===message:i agree with you ursula. another form of propaganda used was the continuous coverage of the rescue efforts followed by the mourning of a nation coverage. if you turned the television channel this is all you saw. to actually see those monumental buildings no longer erected, really instilled heartahce, followed by fear, and ultimately anger. which is the exact emotion desired by the government. anger would prove to provide support in the hunt for osama bin laden.

===message:I was very much with you until the end.  Is retaliation common sense or the outcome of emotions?  I am in no way saying that the government should sit back while it's innocent citizens are killed, but are our reactions always logical and common sense.  There is much in the government that we do not know of.  We are not part of the meetings and debates that occur when the prospect of war is entertained. I would never want to be in a position to make such a decision, because it is not just common sense all of the time.  There are pros and cons to going to War and I recognize that.  My personal opinion is that I wished that we never had to participate in War, but I do know that in some cases that would be unrealistic.  I have to hold on to the hope that War is not the end all and be all of every situation, because if that is true, then we as a people will be fighting until the end of the earth.

===message:Definitely, anger can spur people on to do things, that if they had time to think about it, would be unthinkable.  The media uses this human weakness not only in times of trouble, but in our everyday life to insight us to action.  As with everything else, this can be both positive and negative.
