===message:Those were all good points.  It seems that most good leaders would already know if they are willing to go to war.  I personally believe that for MANY years, the Japanese had desired war with the United States.  I believe they just wanted to get as much material from us and as much time as possible, to strike at a critical moment.  Their leaders did not really plan on negotiating a peace and that can be seen from their stubborness at the end of the war when called upon to surrender.  They were too pround to surrender when they could not possibly have seen a way to triumph short of the Allies not wanting to prolong war.

===message:I also believe that Japan wanted to go to war with the US.  At that point, we were a country rich in economic resources and were becoming more powerful.  I think they wanted to defeat the US before it became too strong.  No one had tested our strength and they believed we could be conquered.
