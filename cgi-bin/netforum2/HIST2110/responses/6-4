===message:I think the shining moment of reconstruction went beyond people willing to fight for black suffrage and civil rights.  Although short lived, it was a reality.  Freedman were able to vote and even served in southern legislatures for the first time in American history.  There was, however, a striking difference between the black officeholders and the freedman who voted for them.  Officeholders cared about obtaining equal rights and what was most important to freedman was their economic future - land acquisition.

===message:Chad,  i agree with your ideas about reconstruction and applaud your sense of understand when it comes to the radical republicans.  Im glad im not the only person who acknowledged the Supreme Courts failure to do its job.  Just out of curiousity, what do you mean by the paper tiger?

===message:I also agree with you.  Reconstruction could have been successful if they had the backing of the military to ensure that the rights of blacks were not being infringed upon.  The radical republicans were thought to be radical because they believed blacks should be treated equally and that blacks should be enfranchised.  Unfortunately people started to turn their backs on black suffrage.  The government was more concerned with the unification of the states than of the rights of blacks.

===message:thanks.  imagine a tiger made out of paper.  it wouldn't be that scary.  unlike a real tiger that has teeth and can be effective, a paper tiger is nothing more than paper.  i hope that explains it a little.

===message:I do not think we can label reconstruction as a failure.  It may not have lived up to it's fuill potential, but iot was a good stepping stone to the modern civilization we enjoy today.  There were a number of good things that came out of reconstruction.

===message:Again we have to look at reconstruction in the light of it being a stepping stone. I think it would be totally impossible to believe that the slaves would be freed and then allowed to be equal citizens to white Americans the same hour.  We have to understand the mentallity of the people of this time.  Blacks were not even looked at as being people.

===message:I think you brought up a good point in stating that politicians were afraid of hurting their career if pursuing further legislation for the freedmen.  So many of the politicians and the President himself, were more concerned about how their popularity would be affected and they wanted to ensure themselves re-election votes for the next term.  Therefore, I think the politicians' trying to please the south and the white man, had a lot to do, along with the fact that the laws were not enforced, with the reason why reconstruction was not as successful as it could have been.  But to say that reconstruction was a total failure, in my opinion, isn't true, because even though the laws were not enforced as they should have been, it gave all black men freedom, which would change their lives forever.
