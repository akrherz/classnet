===message:Chris, you make some very good points.  You may not be an expert, but you do seem to have a lot of knowledge.  I have only noticed a decline in the last three years, but after reading your post, I really thought about it and you are right.  The U.S. has never really recovered and we are definitely in for some hard times in the next ten years.  This makes it hard for students like us in terms of make life choices.  Nothing is ever a sure thing and I will keep the faith that things just may turn around.  I am also a realist and am looking at safe ways to insure that I will continue to be able to feed, cloth, and house myself and my family.

===message:Chris, I agree with you and also think that with all the headcount reductions (layoffs) going on in all industries on a continuous basis today, people are realizing that the economy has not bounced back to a point where one can truly feel comfortable.  When one loses as job today, another one is not easily found the next day.

===message:Chris you must be a Econ major.  Love the way yu broke this down.  I agree with you wholeheart.  The only place that I dont agree with you is the growth.  We had a great 6 years during the Clinton administration that people tend to want to forget during the new Bush era.  We have a long way to go and it seems it will be another 6 years befor we get back to thier but I still like your assesment.

===message:Chris,
I agree and disagree with your points. I do agree that we are in some tough times for the next couple of years and probably the next ten years. But, i don't agree with point that there hasn't been any growth from the last 20 years. As Al Desomnd stated in his response, we have had an excellent run during the Clinton administration. This was due largely to the big technology boom which turned the economy around and have the largest growth period ever recorded. The market is like a roller coaster and it will continue to go up and down.
