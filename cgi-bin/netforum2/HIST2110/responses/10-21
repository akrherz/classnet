Not all women stayed at home to be housewives. Women, especially married started entering the workforce to earn extra money for the household. Television in the 1950's, used tactics to convince women that their place in society was at home with their families. Television shows such as I Love Lucy and Father Knows Best are examples of how women were depicted. 
You are right, women of today have more choices than women of the 1950's. Unfortunately, there are also many women today that have been force to be the sole provider of the households. Being able to make a choice, I will say yes, as for as the family structure, I will say no.

===message:Wow, you really kept it short and simple.  I don't agree with your first sentence because you made it seem as if all women stayed at home, but then after reading the rest of your response I understood what you meant.  So I agreed with your other answers.
