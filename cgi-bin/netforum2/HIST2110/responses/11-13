===message:I disagree on your divisive views because not all groups as a whole became militant maybe some individuals got tired of protesting and resulted to violence but not as a whole group.

===message:According to out text, each group had those who followed peaceful methods to try to obtain equality and those who used more militant means.  I think that this can be said for all groups of people.  There will always be those who feel that you can talk through disagreements and those who feel that force is the only way.  I don't think that I stated that as a whole any group went either way, but if I did I stand corrected.
