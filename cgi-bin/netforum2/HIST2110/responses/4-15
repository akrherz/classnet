===message:Very good.  I liked your answer.  The South was scared about losing its ability to live off of the work of people that they did not have to pay.  You continue to offer good insight with your statement that a non-partisan solution would have been impossible, due to the South's disagreement based on the idea of states' rights.  The north also was concerned with the idea of state's rights.  They felt that the south's representatives had done them wrong on several issues.  They were also worried about the security of their jobs when free labor is so abundant, thus their reason for not wanting the spread of slavery to go on.  I agree highly with argument.  Any other comments?  What lead the south to believe that they were losing their rights as states?

===message:I agree with you.  The issue became not so much about slavery, but the right of one state to tell another what they should do, or the government telling a state what they should do.  It's not what your telling me, but your right to tell me anything.  By the time of succession, everyone was parinoid and thought that the other was the enemy, so no leader would have been able to fix it.

===message:It's always been interesting to me that Southern states contend that they fought the Civil War for "states' rights" rather than for the institution of slavery. Even our textbooks made sure that we were all clear on that. As a Southerner, I think we need to look at our past more honestly and accept responsibility for who we've been. Wouldn't our stance on states' rights have been discussed righteously on the front porch while slaves served us lemonade? It seems like a bizarre denial to me.
