===message:The weakening of the states' rights, which simultaneously expanded federal powers really hit "the nail right on the head", for it speaks to the very essence for which America now stands for. The beliefs of few should never out weigh the rights of everyone. The fundamental ideology that grew out of the Civil war abolished the thought of secession and created a " more perfect Union."

===message:I agree with you, this was definitely a good start to a better nation.  With the South relying on producing tobacco and cotton as a way of life, it fell behind the North in almost every area of achievement - wealth, productivity, population, literacy, and culture.  The war did not solve all issues but it did help shape the beginnings of a strong nation with a centralized government that would promote economic self-sufficiency.

===message:I would have to disagree with your generalization that the South had fallen behind the North.  Although the South did not have the economic output of the North, it also did not have the population of the North which contributed to the difference in production.  Also, in the North most people did not live the "American Dream."  Many lived in slums like New York and Philadelphia where they crammed into small flats and worked too hard for too little money.  I believe that free whites had a better quality of living in the South than in the North.  While the Civil War did end the practice of slavery for the most part, it did not end blacks slavery to prejudice and segregation.

===message:Actually, if you'll re-read my answer to the question posted, I did not say that the South fell behind the North.  In fact, I only stated that America, as a nation, was better and revolutionized.  Please re-read.
