===message:Chad, I agree with what you have to say concerning the use of propaganda and government control.  I too desire a united America, but I cherish my individual liberties much as you do.  It humors me how the media portrays this war now with Iraq to be the only war that America has ever been against (excluding Vietnam).  When in actuality, over one-third of the population in colonial America rejected the idea of the Revolutionary War that gained our independence.

===message:Okay, so are you saying that we should not be able to hear all sides of the debate regarding going to war and that repression should exist today as it did during World War I.  If so that is at the cost of civil liberties.  As far as I can see there has been plenty of media coverage for both the pro and con demonstrations.  The "liberals" as you call them have not had a monopoly on availability to speak out.

===message:Chad:  I'm not sure what channel you are watching, but I haven't seen overwhelming dissent to the war but from celebrities, who certainly have no greater knowledge and no impact on my opinion.  In fact, on AOL, a daily poll is taken by AOL members and the poll suggests that support is continuously increasing for a war on Iraq.  Just a moment before I wrote this reply, 69% of those who answered the poll thought it would be riskier to leave Saddam in power, whereas only 22% thought it would be riskier to attack.  Of course, the remaining 9% had no opinion.  Just thought you might try checking out different media options.

===message:What channels am i watching?  CNN, NBC, ABC, MSNBC, i don't watch fox news so i cannot say what their "ideology" is.  Have you heard of any of those?  And how about the newspapers?  Wall Stree Journal, New York Times, USA Today?  These are only some of the more popular news sources.  Start paying a little more attention to the subtleties.  For example, some of you may have heard that their had been several "Rallies for America" demonstrating America's support for President Bush and his stand on the Iraq issue.  Did you read of these accounts in the newspapers?  If you were lucky enough to find the small 3 paragraph note on the 9th page then congrats.  But did you see it on TV?  Just barely.  CNN wouldn't touch it.  MSNBC?  not a chance.  However, they do manage to point out that their are "hundreds of thousands of people"  protesting the war, saying they do not support Bush.  And they say the media is objective.  right.  if you think that the media is unbiased then i pity you because their are many, many viewpoints that you are missing.  And about your survey.  I tend not to give much credit to surveys because they do not accurately portray a demographic.  They are skewed, and not representative.  If you want some more explanations in support for my ideas let me know, I will respond.  This should be good for now.

===message:I don't agree with your point of views even though well stated. I do believe that people should have the right to voice their opinion it is part of our constitutional rights. I also feel that both sides have been evenly broadcasted in the media but over all I feel that we should not go to war just because the President Feels we need to for his on personal gain.
