===message:Voting is an important right in our lives.  It is also a right that many do not take.  I am glad that you mentioned that.  I have to disagree with you on your position to Clinton's extramarital affair.  As one of the other students in the class mentioned, if a man will lie to his immediate family, then what prevents this man from lying to a nation?  He has already demonstrated his lack of morals and conscience.  Your discussion of voting led me to another conclusion.  If one does not vote, then one made his opinions silent.  Thus, that same person has no right to make any judgment on the president or any other elected official, but instead, must learn from his mistake and vote next election.

===message:I definitely agree with you regarding learning from your mistakes and making sure that you vote in the future if you have or had no part in past votes.  We will have to agree to disagree regarding Clinton.  I don't happen to believe that if you lie to your family(or loved one) that you will lie to the public (U.S.).  Who said that Clinton had lied to his wife?  Before Clinton ever became President, he was known to cheat on his wife.  That did not stop him from campaigning or becoming President.  Congress only voiced an issue with his morals after he was sued for sexual harrassment.  Remember that some of the same congressmen who pointed a finger were also found to be adulterers.  I try very hard not to point a finger because it is too easy to make assumptions about others when you don't know all the facts.  What if Hilary knew about Monica and was dealing with it her own way.  There are plenty of men who do excellent jobs of running large corporations, putting out fires, arresting criminals, etc. who treat their wifes like s---.  I am not saying that it is right or that they are good or bad people.  People have issues that we don't know about.  People do things for different reasons.  I will not assume that Bill Clinton will lie to me, someone who assisted in placing him in office because he lied to his wife.  I don't know that he lied to his wife.  Morals are in the eye of the culture in which you live.  Adultery is wrong in my opinion, but it's just that my opinion.
