===message:Lindsay, I agree that the Watergate scandal was more damaging than anything that President Clinton did, but do you think that with the Clinton we were more concern with our 401k than what he did with the intern? Nixon did a lot of good things for this country, but he was too paranoid about everyone else to see the good. Clinton also did a lot of good things, but I am afraid that he will always be remembered for the scandal. It is sad that we tend to only remember the bad events and not the good ones.

===message:I see your point, Robert.  I guess I just don't care what he did with Monica Lewinsky.  From the beginning of that scandal, I've felt that was a personal situation that the government should have dealt with internally.  I do not feel like that was a reflection of Clinton's successes or failures, but rather a reflection of his relationship with his wife and family.  It was totally wrong for him to lie about the situation once it was revealed, but maybe if it hadn't been revealed in the first place it wouldn't be something to remember him by.  I think the difference between the Clinton scandal and the Nixon scandal was the intention of each president.  Clinton's intentions were not to deceive the people of the country...his intentions were to have an affair.  Nixon's intentions from the get-go were to deceive us into electing him president.

===message:Lindsay,

I agree with your summation.  But I was just thinking about JFK and the many affairs he had outside his marriage during his presidency.  Did that also make him disloyal to the country as is perceived by Clinton's actions?  Why do we connect JFK with assassination and Clinton with infidelity when they both were unfaithful to their spouses?

===message:I agree with you Lindsay about Clinton's affair being personal.  However, that does not change the fact that I lost a great deal of respect for the man because of it.  I think the Monica Lewinski scandal was taken too far as well.  And Carla, I wonder as well - why do we connect JFK with assassination moreso than unfaithfulness?  Maybe because the assassination was much more prominent in the news and much more of a shock?  Just a guess.

===message:Lindsay I agree also that the Clinton "scandal" was more a personal matter rather than a national issue.  It happens, there have been numerous affairs in the presidency.

===message:Good question!  I think the country was so astonished and traumatized by the assassination of JFK, that the people decided it was okay to overlook his unfaithfulness.  In their eyes, they saw an American tragedy and felt the best way to preserve his memory was through undying love and affection.  I think many people chose to overlook the real JFK because the assassinated JFK was much more interesting.

===message:Oh, I agree about losing respect for Clinton.  I have barely any respect for any man (or woman) who cheats on their spouse.  It was just a different kind of lack of respect that I might would have experienced for Nixon.
