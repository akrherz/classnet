===message:I agree with your perception that there is no need to take extreme precautions in most cases.  There are so many things out there that can harm or kill you that if you spend all your time worrying about it, it would consume you.  Besides if something like nuclear war were to occur, I don't think I would want to be one of the survivors wandering the wasteland waiting to starve.

===message:I agree and disagree.  I truly feel that somewhere America really feels that thier day is coming for the attrosities that we have allowed to happen in the US and abroad.  If you really think about all the pain and suffering that we have caused right in our own country how can you seriously take freedom in IRAQ serious.
