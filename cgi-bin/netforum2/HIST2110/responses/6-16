===message:Exactly, the Republicans did have great dreams; unfortunately, many of the people in this time frame had different ideas than the Radicals.  Many of the predujices of this time were the beliefs and thoughts of many, for many of years.  It is unfortunate that the implementation of the Admendments did not see their true potential until later; but as you mentioned, they did provide for the future improvements.  I thought that your discussion for chapter 5 was on point.

===message:I also believe that recounstruction was a partial sucess, because of the readmission of the southern states, but not because of the Freedmans Act. The Freedmans Act created the admendments that were important to all black americans, but due to the Radical Republicans beliefs and The Supreme Court racist decisions continued to hold the African Americans back. Reconstruction was a partial failure because of the Radical Republicans and their unwillingness to cooperate and push their policies, caused further disruption within the country.

===message:Reconstruction ideas were great in theory and had all members of society agreed on beliefs the country could have been healed immediately; I agree that time is what was need to bring about unity (for the majority).

===message:I some what agree with you! Reconstruction did open doors for people to be treated equal, reconstructing the state government, and readmitting the south to the Union.  BUT!!! A big but! To many people had the idea of "this is a white man’s world". Therefore the laws and amendments never sever the jobs they were put in place to do.  I don’t think the blacks had any choice in stopping any dreams. The radical republicans realized this as well. I think that’s when they realized someone needed to be strong and stand up to the government.  I also think if they had gotten their way, maybe we as a nation wouldn’t be still paying for reconstruction now.  YSE! "unfortunate the implementation of the Amendments did not see their true potential" then, and still not now! Nothing has changed!!!  I was reading Hannah discussing, and she mentioned the flag issues.  Why are we stilling trying to rise that flag of hatred? I could see if it really stood  for something (like if we really won that war). To many people back then, just as now turn their heads on certain issues.  How can one say "reconstruction was part success and part failure"? Come on people open your eyes!  History repeats it self, no new tricks, just new faces.
