===message:The movements were a wake up call to the white population.  But, the movements did have an adverse affect in some cases.  The movements seemed to seperate us into classes even more.  When seperated into classes (Black Power, Red Power, etc....) a sense of competetion can happen.  In essence, the movements seperated us even more.  Acting as one instead of splitting into groups would have been better.  We all know that there is no way that would ever work.  So, the movements were probably the right thing to do at that time in history.
