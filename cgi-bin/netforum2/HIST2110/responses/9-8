===message:The war has begun against Iraq to destroy chemical and biological weapons? As a society, we still fear Sadaam threats of attacks a home and abroad. Have we forgotten about the search for Bin Laden? Our attention now is directed to Iraq. But Bin Laden, the terrorist, is still unaccounted for. Just like Sadaam. Has this become another wild goose chase? There is certainly alot to fear.

===message:You were right Mrs. Hatch in you discussion.  You gave good reason and a great analogy of the Cold War and the times we are in today.  Many Americans do fear that our soil can become a war ground.  Many political analyzers have stated that the next major war for Americans will be fought on our soil.  This is a very disturbing statement, however true it is.  
Mrs. Plowden, we are at war in Afghanistan as well as in Iraq.  You may be right, though.  The hunt for Saddam may turn out with the same wild goose chase for bin Laden; however, either way, Americans' need for security calls for the attention and search for such men as Saddam and bin Laden.

===message:yes that is so true kathryn. i live in constant semi-panic. if i hear an airplane that seems to be just a tad bit too close, i freak out!! :0) i think that the fear of the unknown causes us all to panic. and you are right for someone/something to threaten our oh so comfortable way of living is very fear instilling. i think many of us fear what happened to pearl harbor. many can not even conceive or sitting out on their lawns enjoying the everyday life that many of us take for granted, and suddenly seeing fight jets of another country fly over head.

===message:You made a valid point so do you believe that American are spoiled? Or do you believe that as Americans we feel that we are invisible to war? So we are afraid because we (government) know that it is more to the story than they want to tell us? This is scary.
