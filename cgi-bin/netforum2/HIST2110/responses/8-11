===message:Even if Japan had been willing to negotiate with the U.S. prior to WWII, the conflict between the nations was unavoidable.  This was due to the alliances that each had already committed themselves to. The U.S. agreed to help the British and French against Germany, and Japan had agreed to side with Germany should it be attacked.  Even if Japan hadn't bombed Pearl Harbor, when the U.S. entered the war against Germany, Japan would have been compelled to declare war on America.  It was only a matter of time before Japan and America were at war with one another.

===message:I definitely agree with you, but I also feel that Japan had it's own agenda and was looking for conflict with the U.S. on it's own.  Germany and Italy were fighting on their own for their own expansions.  War with Japan had to do with China and Anerican interest and commerce in China.  I agree that if War with Germany or Italy had been first, that Japan would have joined in, but I think that two interests turned into one after Pearl Harbor.

===message:I do agree the taking of a person life seems very easy these days. But why are we at war do any body know? I feel that we are at war because of a personal reason if that is the case it is very easy to say right now if the war is worth it or not. But if it is more than that then to me America as a whole should come together to weight the pros and cons of a war before we send our troop over to die for a cause that might be worth dieing for. We can't live in the past because what work back then might work in the present.
