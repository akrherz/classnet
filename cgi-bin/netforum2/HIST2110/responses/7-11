===message:very well put james! i agree with you as far as the nondisclosure of total war information to the people. that applies to the current war we're in now. to this day i still don't know exactly what we're fighting over. i have an idea, but there has been no concrete answer provided for me yet. this is because there is no concrete answer for the people of the nation because we don't get the full story. disclosing this information would definetly proove detrimental to the war effort.

===message:As James stated, propaganda was necessary to mobilize not the army, but the nation to back the army.  While the military is fighting, and dying for what we believe is right, the nation at home needs to support them.  Those at home are necessary for the production of the war material used by the military.  If the home front is not behind the military, the fighting soldiers will not receive the equipment and support necessary to be victorious on the field of battle.
