===message:Even though I stated that the Nixon was the lesser of two evils, your argument was very well presented.  Even though your argument was very well stated, it is your comment on the ability of Americans to not respect the presidency that I am truly impressed with.  You stated very well your thoughts, and I agree with you.  The presidency and the president are two different things, which require two different types of respect.
