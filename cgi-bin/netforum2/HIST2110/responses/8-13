===message:I agree with everything you said.  After the attack of Pearl Harbor there was no way things would get better from it, it made everything a whole lot worse.  I believe the war that is taking place right now could have been avoided too.  Bush gave Saddam an ultimatum and he didn't want to cooperate, so America and its allies went to war on Iraq.

===message:At the present time, I think that diplomacy is a hard thing to accomplish when two countries believe so strongly in their opinions.  Some things are impossible to avoid.  Most of the presidents that have been in command at a time of war have thought of our safety and preserving the American way of life.  Where the problems come in is where the president is thinking of Economics.
