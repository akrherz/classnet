===message:Your discussion was on point and had many examples.  I also agree with you that the panic that Americans and others around the globe sometimes feel is because of the need for self preservation.  Once someone is taken out of their comfort zone, they must do whatever they feel; necessary to feel comfortable and safe again.  You gave many examples of why the fear of communists spread throughout America; however, I think you left out that many Americans hated Communism because if they did not, then they would be branded and punished as a communist.  Do you think that this could have been the case?

===message:It appears that you are saying that this fear is a natural circumstance of what has occured with 9-11-01.  And I agree that it is, but do you think that it can get out of hand.  It definitely did with McCartyism.  When a person can make up lies about people and be supported by government that becomes a scary thing.  What is the point of the Constitution if it can be bent around "what if's" and "if then's)

===message:I do think that one possible reason people hated Communism was because the government forced it upon them or branded them as traitors.  It was hard to be a communist sympathizer and survive in the US.  It was a time of fear and uncertainty, which also had an impact on the views of communism.

===message:I do agree that the American hated communism and they did everything in their power not to succumb it. And yes if the Americans did not hate communism they did fear they would label as a communist.
