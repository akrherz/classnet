===more:In 1858, William Seward spoke of an "irrepressible conflict" between slavery and freedom, and Abraham Lincoln announced that the nation could not be "permanently half-slave and half-free." Both were suggesting that conflict and disunion over the slavery issue were inevitable.  Were they right?  Was a peaceful, nonpartisan solution impossible?  Was a policy of moderation doomed to fail?  Would it have made much difference whether the nation was led by moderates or fanatics?
