===message:Compare the Federalist and Antifederalist positions on the ratification of the Constitution.  Both parties wanted some orderly form of government.  But when the Federalist proposed the Constitution, the Antifederalist saw it as another Stamp Act crisis.  Only because the proposal didn't have provisions for individual rights.  The Antifederalist felt that the rigths of the people needed to be part of the balance of power.  I would have sided with the Antifederalist soley because total control by the elected officials and their government could lead to tyranny and misuse of power.  Development of a goverment that protects, provides and guarantees the rights of states as well as individuals w/o favoring one entity over another is what makes the Constitution the Constitution.

===message:The Federalist took the stance that a strong national government needed to be established.  However, the power should be balanced between the National and State Governments.  The anti federalist could not see the possibility of a balance of power between the state and federal government.  They also felt that democracy could not be acheived through one government.  Even though a system of checks and balances were implemented the constituition did not "garuntee" the rights of the states and the people.  I feel I may have sided with the anti federalist because this new way of governing had not been tested and tried, and it seemed as if it opened the possibility of a national government controling the entire country.  The whole decleration of independance was based on the idea of sovereign states and individual freedoms, so why would we give that much power back to a central government.

===message:The Federalists sought to ratify the Constitution, which provided for 3 branches of government (Legislative, Executive and Judicial), a system of checks and balances (so one branch would not have more power than the other two), a Senate (which provided for equal representatives from every state) and a House of Reps. (which provided for proportional representatives from every state).  The Anti-federalists felt that the idea of the national government being the "supreme law of the land" allowed the national government too much power and control and felt that the states should be entitled to more power.  In addition, they saw the president as the "king," an unwelcome similarity to Parliment and the King in Britain.  The antifederalist wanted a Bill of Rights put in place to ensure their individual rights, which the constitution did not provide for.

I would side with the federalists.  I believe that the system they designed was well thought out and sought to satisfy the interests of all Americans.  The citizens were able to vote for their own representatives and their interests would be represented in congressional meetings.  Clearly, the system of 3 branches of government and checks and balances worked:  It still works today!  Also, one national government under which many state governments operate makes more sense than a bunch of state governments who have to work together without a central government to referee.  I do agree with the antifederalists that they should have been entitled to a Bill of Rights.  Had I lived in that time, I would have lobbied for that as well.

===message:	The Federalist and Antifederalist had conflicting opinions, yet each had valid arguments to back their ideas up.  The Federalists, already seeing the lack of support and struggle with the states, felt that a government that combined the national and state governments into a balanced unit would best serve the new nation.  In this way, the federalists thought that one person, social class, or other group of people could not have complete control and influence in the government.  Accompanying this thought with their checks and balance system, the federalist created on paper a very well designed, balanced government.  However, this idea was solely on paper; never had such an unfamiliar idea been implemented, especially when considering the fact that many political writers saw restraining government as the only way to eliminate despotism.  The Antifederalist saw this line of reasoning as their argument against the Constitution.  Antifederalists’ arguments were further strengthened by the fact that nowhere in the Constitution was there a guarantee that the government would protect the rights of citizens.  Therefore, presupposing that the Antifederalist argument reached me through some means (since many papers and wealthy citizens were non-supporters of the Antifederalists), I would have chosen the side of the Antifederalists.  Again, this is only if I found out about the Antifederalists’ views through an unbiased source, which would have been hard to find.  The Antifederalists’ argument seems so fundamental seeing that I would have already experienced the control of an overbearing King and Parliament.  The Constitution proposed a seemingly symbolic king and Parliament (president and Congress) government.  Furthermore, the idea that the state governments would better represent their people, through the knowledge they gain with a closer interaction, makes me magnetize to this side more.  But mainly their argument concerning the guarantee of individuals’ rights steers me to this argument.  Whether yesterday or today, everyone wants a guarantee, especially after a violation of trust as the Americans recently experienced with England.

Both sides had strong feels and express their beliefs to anyone willing to listen. Now the federalist, also now as wigs, believe that our country needed a constitution to help regulate the people thru an establish government. The make-up of the Federalist Party includes the wealthiest and most honored men. Just couple of the elite names where George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. Two major advantages that they had over the Antifederalist were their political influence and the ability to fund their cause. There were eighty-five essays called the Federalists Papers written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay that gave a little insight into the direction that the Federalists wanted the government to go. The essay that had the most influence and greatest impact was number ten, because it expressed James Madison views that by having a large society and diversity one group would be unable to control everything. Now the Antifederalist, also know as loyalists, believe that our country didn’t need a government to police its people. They still showed loyalty to crown. Just couple of the names that made up the Antifederalist party was Patrick Henry, George Manson, and Richard Henry Lee. Now the downfall for Antifederalist party was the lack of determination and they just assumed that their supports would be behind them the entire why. They lost their fight in the end, but their strong convictions led the government to enact the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is a system of checks and balances that help regulate congress a little better. Its ironic that we didn’t want to help Britain in the debt that they occurred in the US, but in the end our determination for freedom led to huge amounts of debt. I believe that the elite of our society should not control the government, but their quest for our freedom help establish where are country is today. So, in saying that, I respect the federalist for wanting us to stand up for ourselves and establish a government. Also, I respect the antifederalist for not giving up on their beliefs. Which help establish the bill of rights.

===message:During the events leading to the Revolutionary war, one sentiment was particularly strong among the Americans – they did not want a despotic, tyrannical government.  To many, this meant keeping powers reserved to the states and not giving the central government any power to tax or regulate commerce.  The Articles of Confederation were issued from this principle.  This means there were 13 separate states all issuing their own money, trying to reach agreement on trade, etc.  The very weak central government could only request taxes from the states, so they had no way of raising funds to pay off debts (such as the huge debt accumulated because of the war.)
Federalists saw the flaws with this system and set out to create a system of government, outlined in the Constitution, that would give more power to the central government while reserving most power to the states.  They did this by creating a unique set of checks and balances that would prevent one part of government from becoming too strong and overpowering another.  However, many Antifederalists (those who opposed the Constitution) were hesitant to ratify it because they were unconvinced that the government would not become oppressive.  The problem, to them, was a strong central government and they wanted to find a way to improve upon the Articles without totally restructuring.
When thinking on this, I am not sure what side I would have been on.  I can see both viewpoints very well…the Federalists knew the Articles were simply not working and something had to change, and the Antifederalists were concerned with protecting their hard-won freedoms.  I really don’t know which side I would have been on, but I know I definitely would have had an opinion.

Issues such as finance and trade contributed to the nation's economic depression.  This government would have a system of shared power and dual lawmaking by the national and state government.  The Federalist established three government branches and checks and balances to guard against tyranny.  The Antifederalist, on the other hand, were very fearful and suspicious of concentrated power.  The Antifederalist claimed the constitution would make a king of the president, that it favored the rich over the poor, gave the federal government too much power, and denied individual rights to citizens because it lacked a bill of rights.  Given the past experience with the King, Parliament, and the war, I would have taken sides with the Antifederalist.

While the constitution laid the groundwork for a safer America, it provided a climate where less populated states could have their interests sacrificed for the benefit of larger states. This opinion is correct as can be witnessed by the modern political clout wielded by California and the densely populated Northeast. However, the federalist fears of a weak nation would most certainly have been proven correct if ratification had failed. The nations of Europe were still actively vying for colonial and imperial superiority and America most likely would have fallen to each region aligning itself with the European power that best represented its interests.</P>

They felt that the creation of a central government looked suspiciously like the British government that they fought so hard against. They argued that there would be no balance of power in the national and state government. They also believed that the republicans would dominate. They feared that without some type of guarantee, the liberties of individuals and states would again be violated. On the other hand, the Federalist believed that encroached barriers did not protect liberties, but a carefully planned system and faith would. They went on to explain that the new government would be divided into separate branches, each having a mode of elections and each having different powers. This planned is called checks and balances. I think that I would have been an Antifederalist. Again it was the ordinary people that wanted to be heard. After all they had just fought a war for that very reason. How would you know the needs of all when you only have a chosen class in congress? In Philadelphia 1776, everyone that went to revise the Articles were either wealthy or men of honor.

===message:The Federalists believed the Constitution would help to create a new national government or authority which would ensure that all states would be represented equally (regardless of their size) with self-imposed checks and balances so that no one branch of government had complete control or power.  Whereas, the Anti-Federalists believed this was the exact opposite of what the Constitution would accomplish and that the Constitution was devised in order to give the National Government complete control.  They believed that a balance of power could never be achieved and that only one form of Government (either State or National) would ultimately reign.  In the eyes of the Anti-Federalists the Constitution would place all authority within a central government thereby greatly diminishing the rights and freedom they had fought for during the Revolution and that the Article of Confederation had put into effect (for each state to govern themselves and their population).

I believe I would have taken the side of the Federalists, simply because they were actually trying to prevent exactly what the Federalists feared the most (concentrated power).  The Constitution addressed not only the issue of having one central government in order to ensure all states were represented fairly and equally, but by implementing a bicameral Congress and three executive branches with self imposed checks and balances they were hoping to prevent a concentration of power.  The Federalists believed that each state could continue to govern themselves separate and sovereign which would have ultimately led to complete anarchy within the United States, because the laws varied among each state.  I believe the Federalists were truly visionaries of their time because they knew that in order for America to grow and become what she ultimately would become one day, there had to be a centralized government in place or else the freedoms that they had fought so long for and lost so much for would cease to exist.

This balance would ensure that the United States as a whole would receive what it needed to function (military aid, trade, and taxes) and that the individual states would still have a say over local concerns.  The Anti-Federalists on the other hand held fast to the fear that national government would take over and that it was impossible to balance national and state government.  Domination of the republic was inevitable which would impede upon the rights of the individual citizens.  I think that I would have probably been an Anti-Federalist at first, because I would have had cautious feelings about giving such power over to the rich.  I still have these concerns.  Obviously the Articles of Confederation were not working, but it would have taken much pursuasion and the Bill of Rights to convince me in the end to join in ratifying the Constitution.
