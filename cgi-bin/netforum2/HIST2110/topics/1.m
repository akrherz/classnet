===message:I agree that the British government was attempting to establish tyranny in the New World.  Although the King and Parliment may have thought they were being fair in their implementation of certain taxes (Stamp Act, Sugar Act), it seems that their main purpose for imposing the taxes were to increase their own personal revenue in Britain, which did not seem to benefit the New World at all.  They wanted to increase funds to pay their own royal representatives, but these representatives were not choosen by the colonists and did not serve a unbiased purpose for the colonists.  In fact, when it came time to try colonists for certain acts, they were most assuredly found guilty, just as when it came time to try British person, who were certain to be acquited.  They continued to create laws, taxes, and make declarations which only benefitted Britain.  Not once in this lesson did you discover an act or tax created by Parliment which directly benefitted the colonists. Even the Tea Act, which lowered prices of tea for the colonists, had the hidden purpose of benefitting Britain.  They were only attempting to salvage their own tea company, the East India Tea Company, from bankruptcy.  In no instances do you find that any actions committed by Britain were beneficial to America.

===message:The British government believed it was reasonable in the handling of the American colonies because either they did not know, they did not believe or the chose not to consider all the facts of the war in the Colonies.  For example, the British wanted the colonists to pay the debt caused by the war because they sent their troops to help Americans, when in essence the colonists gathered more troops than the British and were more effective.  The American colonists were right in their belief that the King and Parliament were trying to ruthlessly take over; the Parliament seemingly did not communicate their intentions well to the colonists when it came to implementing the Sugar Act or the Stamp Act.  The colonists were left to assume that Britain was trying to control them and their money in any way they could; however true this may have been, it seemed as though Britain had no desire to change the American’s assumption or their own way of control.

===message:The British were in conflict with France over control of the new world. So, William Pitt came up with the idea to have Anglo-Americas assume the military burden in the new world. In exchange for this action the Americans would not incure any wartime debt.  The result from this agreement eventually gave Britain control over most of the new world. Now the down fall to this agreement was, that the citizens of Britain were left with large amounts of wartime debt. This meant that their citizen’s were taxed extremely high. They felt that Americans should help off set this debt since they were the ones benefiting from the new structure. Several attempts were made in trying to make the Americans help in the tax burden by implementing several acts such as, the Navigation act, the Sugar act and the Stamp act. The Stamp act was the one that people dislike the most, because it tax individuals on items such as, newspapers, legal forms, and licenses. Britain thought that this tax would provide the necessary finances that the high-ranking officers in the Parliament needed and also help with the ongoing military debt. This act caused extreme tension between both parties and resulted in several riots that left people dead and others more confused. Americans felt that Britain should mind their own business and let them regulate their own society. Now the stamp act eventually failed, but others measures soon followed and the result was always the same Britain They continue to have large amounts of debts and the Americans always resisted the new laws. In closing Britain’s actions led Americans to seek their own independence.

The British were greedy in their attempt to dominate the new world and ultimately paid the price.  They should not have assumed that the Americans would pay the entire debt, because the original aggreement was that they would pick up the tab if the American provided the manpower.  Next The Americans could have provided some sort of debt relief to the British since it was "their" war.  I do not feel it was totally unreasonable for the British to expect some relief.  The Americans and the Parliment should have met and discussed the situation and try to come up with a solution together.  Both parties were unwilling to compromise.  Unable to provide a reasonable solution the British attempted to impose their will onto the Americans which led to the Americans seeking independance from the British.

   I think the fundamental flaw in England’s handling of the American Colonies was their perception of Colonies themselves. The majority of the British Empire was an occupation. In colonies in India and other areas of the world they were ruling an indigenous populace who did not consider themselves “The King’s Men”. In America the colonists considered themselves Englishmen and expected representation and consideration as an English province. In the American colonies, the vast majority of the populace were English descendents, as opposed to other colonies where the populace were natives and slaves with English in the government and mercantile professions. <BR>
   The Americans attempted to stay within the confines of the Empire and assert their rights as English citizens, while England failed to see the American colonies as any different than other colonies. If the English merely granted some form of American representation in Parliament and recognized the right of the Colonies to use local government to levy internal taxes, then the entire conflict could have been avoided in the short term. The actions of the British served to only widen the divide and give the Patriots a platform for demagoguery.

===message:I believe the British government was quite confusing to the Anglo-Americans at times.  First the government, under Williamn Pitt, realizes the need and strength of the American colonies to win certain wars.  Pitt offers the American colonies freedom from the war's financial burden if they generated troops, and they complied.  However, when the British government national debt became a burden, coupled with pressure from the British landlords who were being taxed heavily, the government reversed its thinking and felt it "reasonable" that the American colonies help offset the debt.  The British failed to realized two things: 1) the war was theirs, not the American colonies, and (2) the passing of various laws (Sugar Act, Stamp, Act, Writs of Assistance) was only beneficial to Britan as revenue raising measures and not did benefit the American colonies.  Taxes are to benefit the people who pay them.  The British goverment had the right as the "mother country" to institute laws that were beneficial to all colonies.  However, the American colonies soon realized that the British government policies were wrong, burdensome, and were depriving them of their lawful rights.

===message:        The Americans and the British blamed each other for the circumstances that they experience; however, both were to blame.  Through misunderstanding and a struggle for power and authority, the British and Americans both destroyed their relationship. Furthermore, individuals on both sides played key roles in the dissolving of ties.  
	William Pitt promised the Americans that they would not have to bear the burden of a war, however, he did not speak for the majority in England and should have never made this promise without consulting them.  His strategy was beneficial and a major reason for Britain’s success, yet it was a promise he could not knowingly keep.  Since Britons did not fully understand Pitt’s strategy, Americans were forced to pay their part for the war through taxes.  
	Taxes played an important part in the tensions between Britain and the colonies.  Through the taxing of the colonies, Britain hoped to pay for some of their war debts.  The Americans, however, felt that they should not be taxed without their recognition in Parliament.  Thus, the Americans objected to and fought against the several taxes imposed by England.  The British were right in their reasoning behind their wanting the colonies to contribute, after all, Americans were paying far less in taxes than Britons.  On the other hand, Britain can be blamed for the way they taxed the Americans.  The Sugar Act required not only a tax, but also a cunning way to get Americans to buy only British items.  The Stamp Act’s extremely demanding requirements are another example of this. 
	Certain individuals also played a role in the hostility.  Samuel Adams wrote many false accounts to ignite the population of the colonies.  Many others used religion and other platforms to further the schism between Britain and the colonies.  The British customs agents accompanied with other corrupt British individuals further stressed relations.  Both the British and the colonies played their own part in the misunderstanding.

===message:   I think in this situation I would have to agree with the “tyranny” argument. It seems that the repeating theme throughout the events leading up to the Revolutionary war was the fact that the parliament kept levying taxes on the colonies without allowing them representation to vote on the taxes. In comparison, Puerto Rico isn’t an American colony, but it is an American territory and as such receives many of the same benefits as the fifty states. While we don’t try to levy taxes on the citizens of Puerto Rico, we do receive other compensation in the form of land for military bases and things of this nature. We allow representatives to lobby in Washington for causes that affect Puerto Rico but they aren’t allowed to make an actual vote in congress. Now just imagine how the rest of the world, and our own citizens, would judge us as a nation if we announced that Puerto Rico would now be required to pay the same federal taxes that American citizens pay, but they would still have no vote on the taxes in congress. And just to be safe, we’re sending over a garrison of our armed forces to “keep the peace.” I think that we would be judged as a nation of bullies and extortionists and probably be shunned by the rest of the world. In comparison, I don’t think that the situation between England and the American colonies was very different from the hypothetical one presented here.

I do believe the British had the wrong attitude towards the Americans, however.  They seemed to look at them as though they were already a separate country (but a separate country they could manipulate and control.)  Maybe the British could have improved the situation by viewing the Americans as fellow citizens instead of as a method of raising revenue.

===message:I agree that the conflict between the colonies and the British was based on a misunderstanding.  The British people responded to what they thought was fair.  Because the colonies were seen as an outpost of England, they were responsible for helping to pay for debt that they participated in incurring like war.  The colonies were seen as "getting off easy", because they did not pay equal amounts in taxes or contribution to debt relief that British citizens were faced with doing.  Unfortunately, Parliment and the King made decisions that they felt would eleviate this problem, by imposing new taxes on the colonies.  The colonists were not as concerned with the amount of taxes but the way in which the taxation was implemented.  Each action taken from there by the colonies and the British, were in retaliation for an assumed injustice.  Each attempt to one up the other became more and more hostile until it finally was out of control.  Lack of communication appears to be the reason for the call for independence.  Not one single event can be blamed in my opinion.  A snowball effect of many events led to the Revolution.  If the British had a better understanding of the colonies involvement in the French/Indian War then steps taken to make them responsible for the war's financial burden would not have occured.  This started the snowball.

===message:I disagree in that the word “reasonable” implies that some air of fairness exists when in actuality there was none.  The British government attempted to impose their WILL, which history has shown time and time again does not always include or take into account the rights or wills of others.  The colonists did attempt to express their discontentment towards internal taxes, such as the Sugar Act but were ignored.  Instead they were hit with an additional tax (Stamp Act), which was parliaments way of saying we don’t care what you want or think.

I believe like many of my classmates that the British government having reigned so supremely and unchallenged for so long felt as if they could simply do what ever they wanted to the colonists and not encounter any resistance. The colonists had every right to stand up for their freedom and to demand that they not be treated merely as puppets on a string but as human beings.  

Although, spurred on by Parliament’s insistence to unfairly tax the colonists, I believe that America would have sought her independence ultimately. Britain was not willing to allow the new world (America) to blossom and take on her own identity (i.e. Declaratory Act), they wanted to reign supreme as they had always done, they wanted to mirror Old England in the New World and that could not be.  America was a new frontier and beginning for all who came, which meant that the past would ultimately have to concede to the future.

Instead of the two entities working together to make the colonies a better place to live and to grow, the two constantly argued over policy, taxes and religion.  Granted there was a war in America, and the Americans fought in it.  But were they responsible for repayment of the British Government?  And taxing certain goods that were exported into the Colonies only benefited the British.  Not to mention the Writs of Assistance law that enabled anyone’s home to searched for smuggled items.  All of these things were instituted by the British Government.  Because of this, the Americans soon found out that they had no representation in the British Parliament and that they were living under an invalid constitution. This realization plus hostile individuals fueled the Americans fight for independence.  I blame the British for most of the hostility in the Americas.

===message:Briton felt that it had the right to deal with the American colonies as it did since they were a part of the British Empire.  They felt it was fair for the colonies to help pay for many expenses that Briton incurred on behalf of the colonies, especially in regards to the British soldiers stationed in the colonies.  Additionally, Briton saw no problem with enacting taxes on the colonies to generate revenue for the Empire.  The colonies, however, felt no obligation to help pay these costs.  Additionally, while they recognized Briton’s right to exact tariffs on trade to help regulate it, they were very opposed to any taxes solely for the purpose of generating revenue for the crown.  
One of the driving forces behind this difference of opinions centers on the subject of representation in Parliament.  The colonies felt that they should not be directly taxed since they were not directly represented in Parliament.  Many in Briton felt that the colonies were “virtually” represented in Parliament just as the populations of several large British cities who had no direct representation.  Another difference of opinion existed in regards to the elected assemblies in the colonies.  The colonies felt that these assemblies were equal to Britain’s House of Commons in regards to power.  Briton, on the other hand, felt that these assemblies only exercised as much power as Briton allowed them to exercise.
Both sides felt that they were right and saw things from their own point of view.  While neither side was completely “right” in their thinking, isn’t differing opinions that lead to war within a country, or empire in this case, a common theme?  England had to fight to exact its rule and retain its empire throughout the world, notably in India, South Africa (The Boar War) and America.  The only real difference is the colonies were able to defeat Briton for their independence. I guess that makes the colonies right!

They felt their representing them in the war with France was to the benefit of the colonies.  But it seems to me it was more of a power play for Britain rather than a selfless act.  I feel that the government and citizens of Britain did not have the full understanding of the roles played by the colonist during the seven years war, for example two of every five regulars who served in the military had enlisted in America.  The colonists were not receiving credit for the active role they were taking.  Further, they were told that Britain would finance the war if the colonist provided some manpower.  Later, Parliament passed the Sugar Act in 1764 with the goal of raising enough money to offset one-fifth of the military expenses.  I can see how the colonist felt that Britain made promises to Americans and then once they got what they needed they changed their story.  The colonists were trying to build a new world, but Britain seemed to be concerned with controlling the colonies, even if the measures they took did not benefit the colonists.  I am sure that the Americans were somewhat correct in their fear that the British were attempting to establish tyranny in the new world…how could Britain benefit without some control over the colonies?  Anglo-American misunderstandings probably helped to feed the misunderstandings to a small extent, but I think the main goal of the colonists was to protect themselves and try to build a new world without feeling like they were helping to fuel the economy of an established country that gave them no direct representation in Parliament.
