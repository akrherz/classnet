===message:Based on the results of the Civil War, I would have to say that America was completely revolutionized. The end of slavery, the most incredible change, was certainly a good start to a better nation.  The creation of a national banking system lead to national uniformity and most likely instilled confidence in the government.  The promotion of large-scale businesses provided countless jobs for the citizens and improved the economy dramatically after the major economical losses the war caused.  The weakening of the states' rights, which simultaneously expanded federal powers, created a more central, unified government.  A loose federation of states could never accomplish what this strong nation has.

Industry that would help employ millions of Americans and ultimately provide billions for the economy.  The Civil War was the type of "massive bleaching" America neeeded to become a great nation of many and not a powerful group of select persons making decisions. The popular cliche " United we stand, divided we fall" is a self-fulfilling prophecy as it relates to our nation's history.  Without the Civil War and the policies that challenged its purpose, intent and overall ideology. Our very way of life would probably resemble that of our brotheren in foriegn countries, existence without freedoms, rights and self proclaimed liberties.

===message:I will first start by saying that slavery alone, its existing and so call ending, has taken a large toll on America as a whole. Up until the Civil War, the states had the right to set and enforce their own laws. The states still have this right but they are held accountable for laws also set by the federal government. Being that the federal laws overrule the state laws the states laws had been weaken over all expandeing the federal powers by making the Federal Government responsible for all the people of the New World. It also encouraged taxation in order to be able to support the government. Since the northern states had declared their paper money to be legal tender and the southern states had not, it was very easy to initiate a national banking systems. If we were united as one we should all share the same currency. Overall the end of slavery promoted large scale business. The south on the other hand found it to be very difficult without slaves and had to find other ways to make money. Due to these changes in history the farming of old times was replace by big buinesses.

===message:Calculating the results of the Civil War it is easy for me to say that this war was actually beneficial to American Society.  Looking at the wars the U.S. has participated in, there are few that you can look at tangiable things that we have gained.  Just the ending of slavery in itself is enough, because this institution if still in existance will have very well changed the fabric of our society, what whould America be if slavery still existed.  Where would our society be if each state had the power to govern themselves.  I do not feel that the U.S. would be the Super Power that it is today without the protection, and direction of a strong national government.  As harsh as it may sound I feel that the 500,000 lives lost was a small price to pay for everything that we gained from the Civil War.

===message:When the Civil War started, the Union (North) had no intentions of stopping slavery in the south, but in due time their opinion changed. Their primary goal was to make the Confederate states adhere to the Union and all their rules. The Confederate states primary goal was to establish themselves as a separate entity from the Union. They tried for years to get Britain and France to support their theory on being a separate independent nation. Now Britain and France led the south to believe that this goal might be accomplished overtime, but in the end they decided not to get involve in the problems between the Union states and Confederate states. I am glad that Britain and France did not support the Confederate states, because without support from other allies the south had no hope in establishing an independent nation. Therefore, in due time every person would have their true freedom. With the war in place, several Southern Democrats left from the Union and this action allowed Republicans to push thru a National Banking system. Both sides tried in the beginning to support the war by encouraging people to by war- time bonds and creating green backs, but the people chose not to buy these bonds and the green backs had no value. Instead they bought and sold gold. The vision that the Republicans had in wanting a nation banking system was terrific, because it created the foundation that we still use to this day. In closing, you have to ask your self, if Sherman were not so successful in his conquest over the southern states would we have a separate nation right now? I believe overtime that the Confederate states would have succeed to the Union, because they would have ran out of able men to fight and money needed to fight.

===message:The Civil War, although it took many lives, created a better, not perfect, society for the nation then and for us now.  

With regards to slavery, President Lincoln's original intent was not to end slavery but to bring the Confederate states back into the Union with slavery intact.  The Radical Republicans had the insight to know that abolishing slavery was necessary.  As Frederick Douglas stated "to fight against slaveholders without fighting against slavery is but a half-hearted business."  President Lincoln eventually did come around and made slavery a war's goal.

Federal powers were expanded by the weakening the states' rights.  This allowed the federal government to make decisions about things important to the nation as a whole.  Although the states today are still more powerful than the federal government, the U.S. Constitution details specific areas of law where the federal government can get involved in, which are areas of national importance - defense, taxation, civil rights, bankruptcy, interstate commerce, naturalization, patents, and copyrights.

The National Banking Act created a necessary new system of pubic finance, which we all benefit from.

Nothing bad can be said about the war promoting large-scale business.  Ohio Senator John Sherman summed it up when he said "No longer the largest slaveowning power in the world, the United States would now become a major industrial nation."  How thankful we are.

===message:The results of the Civil War abound.  I think, however, that it is the end f slavery that is the most respectable.  Even though this was not the original reason for the Civil War, it was probably the most beneficial and greatest of all of the achievements.  The weakening of states’ rights also ranks very high on the list of great achievements by the Civil War.  The whole disagreement of what a state can and cannot do played a major role in the beginning of the Civil War.  Weakening states’ rights allowed for a more centralized government, thus creating a means for fewer disagreements, by having a chain of command to settle disputes.  Furthermore, the weakening of states’ rights paved the way for the creation of a notional banking system.  The national banking system equalized the markets around the country.  This creation allowed for a similar base to carry out transactions.  No longer would one fox fur buy someone in Arkansas a bag of flour and a person in New York a cup of flour (this is only a scenario).  This example does show the ability for different societies to vary vastly form other societies around the United States; this variation hampers intrastate and interstate commerce.  Furthermore, the national banking system created a means of reliability for Americans.  Americans, north and south, could o have one means of currency, something ht would always have worth.  The railroad provided the means of transportation of information and goods that was needed to heighten expansion, industry, and exportation.  The railroad created the ability for people to travel quicker into the west, thus increasing expansion.  The railroad also increased industry by allowing people in California to ship their products to New York cheaply.  This allowed industries to sell more and provide goods to other industries for production of other products.  Finally, with the expansion of the railroad, farmers and ranchers no longer ad to carry their product to harbors or other towns; their items could easily be placed on a train and carried from place to place, saving time and money.  The expansion of federal powers gave the government the ability to collect taxes, form armies, and act in the “best” interest of the country.  This allowed for the collection and distribution of money, protection from enemies, and general good of the country.  Without some of these items, the country would have had trouble communicating, paying for the war, and defending itself fro other countries wanting to capitalize on America’s weakness from a long civil war. Please feel free to respond, and I will respond back.

===message:Before the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, many nations did not respect the United States.  We were seen as a agricultural nation with little chance of being a powerful, influential, industrial nation.  Many of our ambassadors received little respect from the countries they visited.  The Civil War ended slavery (on a large scale) and established America as major industrial nation.  These developments came with the commerce created by the needs of war.  This probably helped the government realize that it needed to maintain its professional army as well as continue in the development of new technologies to facilitate victory.  It also unified the country around one form of currency as opposed to each bank or state creating its own tender.  I would wager to say that the Civil War created a new nation in many ways similar to the results of the American Revolution for Independence.  We had a stonger national government that was also much more active in the affairs of its society.  The Civil War awoke the government to level of activity that it would have to maintain in order to help its people progress.

I think we can all agree that the end of slavery and the creation of a national banking system were totally positive outcomes.  The expansion of federal power helped to create in the states a sense of unity and belonging.  Promotion of large-scale business helped develop this nation from a mainly agrarian society to an industrialized one.  Taking these things into account, we can see that the United States would probably be a much different place today had the Civil War not taken place.  It is really difficult to say how it would have been different, but the dissimilarities would most likely be more sweeping than we could ever imagine.

===message:The Civil War did one thing to the American people. It woke them up to realize that in order to get anywhere you must work as a team.  You must work together to become strong as a nation and as a people.  Whereas the Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves, slavery did not end there. This Proclamation laid the ground work of the process of freedom for blacks that is still on going.  The African- Americans were never included in the greater plan of team work.  The slaves were used as a pawn to help the North win the war.  However, Lincoln realized, as other great Northern leaders did, that in order to be a respected nation in the eyes of the world, we must overcome our internal disputes and create a working machine.  A machine where all the parts (people) work together under one housing.  Granted the war made us realize what we were lacking, the seeds had already been planted when we broke ties with England.  Slowly with the creation of banks and "corporate" America, this country overcame it’s hindrances, and grew into the nation it is today.

Before the Civil War, states had the ability to establish their own laws based on their personal interest, gain, and greed. Slavery was indeed the fuel to the fire, and it had to end, before the nation could unite. The biggest lesson to be learned about the civil war, is the importance of trying to solve issues peacefully, as we have studied, it was not solved peacefully, it actually produced the biggest blood bath in the North American Continent. I can say that I’m thankful, not for the bloodshed, but for the battle itself and what it represented for all.

As I think back on the issues that generated the Civil War, it only brings painful thoughts to my spirit. I really don’t understand why anyone would want to be reminded of such bondage.  There are activist groups today that are fighting for the confederate flag to become the state flag in some parts of the south. Would it be fair to say that the confederate flag would represent the lives that were lost for a common cause? Or is it fair to say that the flag would become a constant reminder of state's that fought so hard to prevent the end of slavery?

===message:The Civil War was an unfortunate aspect of the rise of the United States.  I feel that the developments of the national banking system, promotion of businesses and expansion of federal powers gained respect for the U.S. by the rest of the World, especially Britain, whose domineering attitude was probably brought to a more respectful level.  In hindsight, I feel the United States could have continued on a path of destructiveness without the Civil War.  Although the original reasons for starting the war differed greatly from the outcome effects, it contributed such a grand change.  The national banking system and the development of a single currency could have taken years to develop and enforce with out the absence of the opponents in the Union government.  The end of slavery goes without saying in my opinion, everyone deserves the rights we have today; although I feel it unfortunate that women were still not recognized as equals after the Civil War.  A feeling of unity was important after the war and the expansion of federal powers achieved this feeling on the government side.  All in all, as gruesome and destructive as the Civil war was, the outcome was such a tremendous change and benefit to the “American people”.

<p>The thoughts on secession changed as well. Up until the Civil War, secession was widely accepted as a ligitimate right of any state. Lincoln changed that with an invasion to bring states back into the Union.</P>
<p>The longest lasting conclusion to be drawn from the Civil War, is the decline in power vested in the states and the rapid assumption of that power by the federal government. A great example of the states loss of power is the marijuana proposition in California. California passed a popular voter referndum to, in effect, legalize marijuana usage for medical purposes. The federal gover still refuses to recognize California's right to determine its own stance and routinely arrests people protected by Californias laws.</p>

===message:The conclusion that I draw from the outcomes of the Civil War, is that a drastic measure such as this is needed in order to make positive changes within man.  Americans had to fight England for their freedom and to change the way in which citizens were controlled by government.  The Civil War did the same thing, although it was not the goal.  The United States went from the largest slave holding power in the world to a major industrial force.  This would not have occured without ending slavery by force.  Southerners would not have let go of the institution for the improvement of the whole nation because they felt that they had the right to do as they pleased.  As long as slaves were seen as property, government involvement with that property would have been fought against.  It took losses on both sides to come up with new ways to carry on daily life, buisness, and government.  Previous ideas of state's rights were brought into a more realistic realm as government made demands and changes that were seen as positive instead of negative.  The national banking system started in the North with much protest was now seen as an asset and a help to the state banks and the economy as a whole.  The use and circulation of paper money which had been shunned before and during the war was shown to be a valuable asset when used as a national currency.  It actually strengthened the North instead of weakening the economy and first thought.  All of the changes occuring during and after the Civil War would not have occurred had it not been for War.  In desperate times, people are able to come up with ideas and willing to try new things due to nothing more than need.  Desperate times call for desperate measures.  The ideals that the war was founded on which were to stop succession, showed the States what was really important, what was needed to survive and what was needed to move on to become a stronger nation.
