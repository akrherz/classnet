===message:I absolutely think that there was no way the North and South could live together peacefully and be separated on the issue of slavery.  A dramatic resolution of the issue for the entire country was inevitable.  It would be impossible for moderation to exist because although it would seem that if the Northern states and Southern states minded their own business about slavery and lived however they wanted that everything would be okay; but, there is no way that this could happen.  A united country cannot live together under one government when each state has the right to decide for themselves (popular sovereignty) an issue so dramatic as slavery.  Even if some states were completely pro-slavery and some were completely free-soil, the two different views would eventually clash and raids, battles, and protests would certainly continue to take place.  I think it does make a difference if the country was lead by moderates or fanatics; obviously, whichever type of leaders control the country, the more likely the entire country would have live by those same values as their leaders.

A peaceful non-partisan solution was not possible simply because neither side was willing to give up what the were passionate about.  I think this issue could only be resolved by the national government declaring America either free-soil or a slave nation, and then being willing to accept the consequences of such a declaration.  there is no middle ground on this issue.

===message:In 1858, William Seward spoke of an "irrepressible conflict" between slavery and freedom, and Abraham Lincoln announced that the nation could not be "permanently half-slave and half-free." Both were suggesting that conflict and disunion over the slavery issue were inevitable. Were they right? Yes, because both sides were so divided on issues of slavery and free soil, no one was willing to bend or accept the opposition's theory. Was a peaceful, nonpartisan solution impossible? A nonpartisan solution was possible, however not without much upheavel. Clearly each side establish the importance of what they believed in. Slavery to some was in-humane and not in the best economical interest of whites. On the other hand those in favor of slavery felt it was necessary to allow certain individuals-slaves to perform the menial tasks that needed to be completed. Even though both parties were divided on the issue of slavery, neither party felt as though blacks were equal to whites. Therefore on that premise alone, a resolution could be reached. Would it have made much difference whether the nation was led by moderates or fanatics? Of course philisophical differences were evident among both the fanatics and the moderates.  The moderates would have wanted the nation to reside under the political auspices of moderation.  The fanatics would have been more aggressive in thier approach to national issues and development of policies.

===message:We cannot have peace in a nation without every individual having his or her freedom. Lincoln and Seward were both right in saying that we are nation that cannot agree on this issue without having internal conflict between the states. The north believed that an individual deserved their freedom, but was not willing to enforce this action in the south. The south thought they had the right to have slaves, because they needed someone to do their dirty work and they thought that the bible just reinforce their beliefs. Now the thought that this outcome would have been different if moderates or fanatics ran the nation is a joke. Moderates would have taken the role of the passive party that just wanted to please everyone. This type action would have led to more confusion. The role of the fanatic would have been my way or the highway. This type of action would have led men to think that their skin color allowed them some type of extra privileges in life.

===message:William Seward and Abraham Lincoln were both correct in suggesting that conflict and disunion over the slavery issue were certain to happen.  The South and North had strong beliefs as to what was needed for them to have a prosperous society and felt those beliefs should not be compromised with in any way.  The South was convinced that the North not only wanted to bar the spread of slavery but also to corrode the moral and political foundation of southern society.  The North was convinced that "Slave Power" was spreading which would not only jeopardize free soil but their society as a whole - no laborer would be able to compete against slaves who worked for free. A peaceful, nonpartisan solution was not possible because each side did not trust the motives of the others.  Even if the nation was led by moderates or fanatics, this conflict would still exist because there were no solutions that would make each side happy and unite them on this issue.

===message:The issues of slavery are a big part of our history and still today these issues remain. The northern slaves and the southern slave were different in the way they were treated. In my opinion the north considered it a hinderance to the white labors that had to charge next to the free slave labor as hindermance to the economy. And on the other hand the south felt slavery was at that time detrimental to the economy of the south. The issue of Seward and Lincoln were inevitable because of the north and south own personanl views and opinion of their own purpose for slavery. This is not a peaceful matter in my opinion to deal with between the sides because of the different views on slavery. Also you can say that to each of them they were correct to feel the way that they did even though in my opinion slavery was and is wrong. But the war was inevitable do to the passionate issues that surrounded slavery for both sides neither side was going to compromise to the other because the need for slaves for both sides were different.

===message:The north and the south were very different at this time.  Consequently, they held very different views on slavery.  The north wanted to abolish slavery because they feared that because people could buy slaves and get free labor, they would not hire workers for a salary.  The south feared that they would not be able to sustain their way of life if slavery was abolished.  Because both north and south held such different views, I do believe that conflict was inevitable.  All the compromises and nonpartisan solutions would do is prolong the inevitable; they would do nothing to solve the lack of unity between the north and south.

===message:The Union, as a union, could not have survived with the two opposing viewpoints of slavery and anitslavery.  As we read, they tried to make compromises to avoid conflict and appease both sides.  However, since the two sides were fighting to support their economic interests, the same argument would have come up in the following years regarding foreign trade and other  issues.  For example, take the issue of civil rights.  At one point or another, the North would have realized the fact that all men are created equal and given the blacks equal citizen status (Civil Rights Movement of the 1960).  How would the south have responded to that?  In essence, in America, you cannot enforce a law in one part of the country and not in another.  It had to be either total slavery, or complete antislavery.  "United we stand, divided we fall"--chinese proverb

What if the case had ruled the other way, for example, in saying that all men are created equal and that the perpetuation of slavery was unconstitutional?  If the courts had supported the antislavery movement and the North would have had a more judicial claim, could peace have been met?  it seems possible because the northern South may have sided with the Union right in the beginning and not waited to make a decision until the guns were firing.  perhaps then the dissent in the secceded south coupled with the overwhelming support of antislavery in the Union would have forced the South to seek a way to resovle the problem.  maybe by phasing out slavery.  this is all conjecture but what do you think?

===message:Looking back on this issue, it is very easy to see how wrong both sides were.  The North wanted to abolish slavery; yet did not like the fact that blacks were allowed to work for lower wages, and there were so many that were just prejudice in general.  The South felt they could not deal with the every day duties in life and could not “live” without slaves.  The only thing the two sides agreed on was that blacks were in no way equal to whites; with such passionate feelings on each side, this was not enough. I feel that Lincoln and Seward were right; there was no way to compromise and solve the conflict reasonably. The North and South were entirely too aggressive to compromise.  I don’t think there would have been much difference if the nation had been run by fanatics or moderates, there would have been fighting no matter what.

===message:Both Abraham Lincoln and William Seward were right.  There was no way for the union to stay together while the struggle over slavery and its limitations continued.  The South felt as if the North was trying to rule over them by telling them were and how far slavery could go.  Furthermore, the South felt as if they could not go on without slavery.  Many southerners believed that the only way that one could have a good life was to on slaves and make the do al the work.  This was also a cheaper method for the South than hiring the many people it would take to do the jobs that slaves did.  The South saw their way of life to be the only way.  Since the South saw slaves as a means of living nicely and more lavishly, they were not to keen on changing the way that they had lived; after all, that would mean they would have to get their hands dirty and that would not be just (sarcasm).  Thus a peaceful solution would in all likelihood not have take place.  Especially with the North feeling as if the South was trying to expand and slavery, which they saw as a means of putting people out of work and immoral.  For there to be so many mixed feelings about slavery ad so many sides to the issue, a nonpartisan solution would have been impossible, as well.  Moderate policy was not necessarily doomed to fail, though.  The actions of Kansas, the Supreme Court, and overzealous individuals, such as John Brown, led to the utterly unthinkable idea of moderation.  These actions led both sides of the fence even further away from each other.  This was supported by Lincoln’s disapproval of the Crittenden Plan.  His decision was probably for the better, though.  Whether the nation was lead by moderates or fanatics would probably have not made a difference.  The South and the North just could not agree nor did they want to agree with each other.  Lincoln saw the amendments of the Crittenden Plan as acceptable, with the exception of the territorial issue.  So, moderate of fanatical, the nation was bound for disunion over the slave issue.  How could they have been moderate and how could they have prevented disunion when both sides wee so worried about loss of territory and power or the moral and immoral beliefs of slavery?

===message:Both William Seward and Abraham Lincoln’s suggestions about conflict and disunion over the slavery issue were right? The North and the South knew that their future of their own social system was at state. The Northern states having laborers and being the largest industrial power, wanted nothing more than to remain as free states. On the other hand, the South which depending solely on slaves, wanted to continue to be slaves states. A peculiar institution, putting it politely, blacks being force to work without pay, for wealthy southern plantation owners, whom bought and sold slaves like cattle. “This was an unqualified Evil to the Negro, the white man, and the state”, said Abraham Lincoln. It was the outside criticisms that caused the South to have doubts and reservations, which led them to strike back with anger and hostility. The south felt that they were being pressed in a corner, and felt that succeeding from the union, was the only solution. 
A non-partisans solution was impossible, because the southern states felt that the dispute was not about slavery but about state rights.  Having a nation led by moderates or fanatics wouldn’t have made any difference, because it was the difference of opinion and interest that the states shared that no one person could resolved.

===message:The type of leadership for the nation would have only mattered in terms of how long it would have taken.  With two sides of such a powerful argument, there did not seem to be a possible comprimise or win-win situation.  The North and South saw slavery as the representation of two separate ideals.  To the North, slavery meant that whites would not have an opportunity to improve their lives through hard work and prosperity.  Slave labor was free and would ultimately have a negative effect on those whites who were trying to work their way to the top.  The South's position was that slaves were property like cattle and insomuch as cattle was needed in an agricultural society, so were slaves.  By looking down upon slavery, Southerners felt that the North was looking down upon the Southern way of life and their right to be prosperous and own property.  Of course, for the North and South, the real issues of slavery's inhumanity went right over their heads and this country has suffered for it every since.  To think that it is just and fair to take a race of people from their country and make them property is a twisted train of thought and a disease that has permeated the United States,especially the South since those early days.  For those who trully believe in a higher power and still hold on to thought that this issue had and has merit, I pity them.  Succession and the Civil War were inevidiable from the very beginning dating back to the ratification of the Constitution.  There was disagreement over this issue then and in order to get ratification, Southern states were pacified.  That pacification was only good for the time it took for the ink to dry.

Honest Abe was right about the slavery needing to be abolished.  Fanatics and Moderates would have eventually come to the same conclusion that we have here today.  If the slavery problem wasn't solved at that particular time in history, then someone would have come along and started the process later on down the road.

But the slaves wanted their freedom and the people of the North saw them in their pain.  The nation could not stay separated on the issue because the slaves escaped to the North to seek refuge and they required protection and help.  Although the southerners felt the slaves were property, others felt they deserved fairness and freedom.  The country would not have thrived under a policy of moderation because it was not an issue of which people could tolerate the opinions of others.

===message:The question of slavery being continued in the United States of America had been an issue at the forefront for some time.  The time had come to settle this issue, or atleast, take a giant step in the direction of remedying the problem.  New territories could not be settled without a constant fight to make it a slavery or nonslavery state. 

For the North, slavery was wrong.  For the South, slavery was right and their way of life.  This was too big of an issue to leave alone.  The Constitution stated that all men were created equal and clearly showed the injustice that was being impounded upon the slaves.  They were not property such as pigs, horses, and cattle.  The North saw them as humans, not their equal, but humans.  This situation of using humans as slaves would have to be dealt with sooner or later.

For the North, I believe freeing slaves was a way to keep Southerners from becoming too wealthy and creating their own Confederacy. The Emancipation would devastate their inductrial society.  Freeing the slaves would stagnate their way of living.
