===more:Why were propaganda, thought control, and repression used with such success in the United States during World War I? Was ideological conformity necessary? Was repression necessary? What would have happened if opponents of the war had been allowed to present their views without restrictions? How do these questions apply to events of post-9/11/01? What happens to civil liberties and governmental power during wartime?
