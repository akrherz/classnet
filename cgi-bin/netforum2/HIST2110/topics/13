===more:Reagan’s terms in office can be described as a period in which the United States "turned inward." Why did the problems facing the nation during the latter 1970s at times seem insoluble? To what extent were solutions found during the early 1980s, and how? Were those solutions permanent or temporary? Are Americans today better off than we were 20 years ago? To what extent could it be argued that the present problems we face are legacies of the Reagan years?
