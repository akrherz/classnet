===message:The primary purpose of the three Power movement groups of the 1960's was to liberate its people; to make the rest of the country aware of the group.  Each of the groups challenged the domaninance of white Americans and sought equal opportunities and recognition.    

The Brown Power group did not initially use armed patrol, but rather sought to follow the methods of Martin Luther King, Jr.  Chavez, the group's primary leader, who was deeply religious and simply wanted greater civil rights and social justice for his people.  Chavez's efforts did lead to better wages and ethnic consciousness for Mexican-Americans.  As the younger generations of Mexican-Americans became politically active, however, militancy ignited and a group called the Brown Berets were formed, modeled after the Black Panthers of the Black Power Movement.  

The Black Power movement was also divided similarly to the Brown Power movement.  Martin Luther King, Jr.,  lead a majority of blacks who were seeking unity, social justice and civil rights in a primarily peaceful and religiously-based manner.  On the other hand, Malcolm X and the Black Panthers sought to separate themselves from the "white devils" and thought it more beneficial to use scare tactics and sometimes force to reach their goals.  MLK, Jr., did bring to light the many injustices facing black Americans and his actions and speeches lead to many reforms in segregation.

The Red Power movement was primarily violence-free and sought to reclaim lands taken by white Americans and to create separation of white and Native American industry, commercialism and education by establishing boundaries on reservations.  The Native Americans did establish an armed patrol group called AIM, but only to protect themselves and not to be the aggressors. 

Each of these movements did bring to light the similarities and differences of each different class and race of people.  Some good things came out of these movements, so it is impossible to say that we are not better off today than we were before the movements.  The only part of each of these movements that I do not find beneficial is the violent-oriented groups.  They served no positive purpose and helped no single American progress.

===message:<p>The main similarity between the militant "Power" groups is that they all viewed violence as an acceptable method for accomplishing political goals. In doing so I think they worked against the advancement of their cause by portraying civil rights movements as full of violent political radicals. The only organization I could consider legitimate would be AIM. The reservation system had been under a long time attack by the federal government and, prior to that, they had been the subject of numerous broken treaties and merciless agression. The AIM was a struggle for survival as a people, not for extending civil rights.</p>

===message:Black Power- Encouraged African Americans to practice self-discipline, self-respect, and to separate themselves from the white society, because they felt that this type of action was the only way that they would gain respect. One of the strongest supports of the black power movement was Malcolm X and he preach that the only way that would get the respect they deserve was to use any means necessary. Also, during this time the Black Panthers came into power and showed the aggressive side of the movement, because they used violence as a means to get what they wanted, instead of peaceful actions. Their actions also lead some of the members to die from violent demonstrations and others to be sent to prison. For all the so-called bad things they did, they also established several black studies programs and encouraged African Americans to love their skin color.

Red Power- Native Americans felt that they were the poorest and most uneducated class in our society. They wanted the government to reimburse them for land that was taken from them during war times and thru treaties. Also, they decided to take the approach of Black Panthers and arm themselves for protection. One of the major things that happen for this movement was, that President Johnson started the National Council on Indian Opportunity.  

Brown Power- The Mexican Americans seen the improvements made by the Black and Red movement and they decided it was the right time for them to make a move toward equality. One man that pushed the movement forward was Cesar Chaves, who admired Martin Luther King Jr., and decided to take his approach of non-violence. The Mexican Americans felt that society look at them as only labors and not real people. Mr. Chaves wanted to change this misconception and rallied his people to protest by not picking the grape and lettuce harvest. Another key issue they wanted was bilingual and bicultural education started in the schools.

One of the greatest things that all these movements brought was strength within their own group and made others aware of their need for equality. I am not sure if each movement was more divisive than helpful, because their goal was to achieve equality and any cost necessary.

===message:The main purpose for all of these civil rights movements was for different races to be recognized as equal citizens to whites, but at the same time enjoy the liberty to keep there identity, heritage that distinguises them from other races.  This movements were quite succesful because it opened the eyes of America to show that white are not the only people who deserve what the Constitution promises.  these movements also forced us to have to accept and learn about different cultures and appreciate peoples defferences instead of fear and hate them.  It is unfortunate that recognition had to come from violence but you have to do what needs to be done.  Peaceful protesting is great and I do not condone violence, but sometimes we need a wake up call to realize the seriousnes of what these different groups are fighting for.  How long should a person march and conduct sit ins while being brutilaized by the police and other organizations until they get tired of the abuse.

===message:"Black Power" was an expression used by African-Americans to mean to simply take pride in the fact that they were of the black heritage. Major Successes: organized demonstrations during the sixties to publicize their plight and to awaken self-respect and cultural pride. Major Failures: the Black panthers gained national publicity from a series of violent confrontations with the police and from Newton's repeated claim that "quoting from Chairman Mao... political power comes through barrel of a gun. "Red Power" was used by Native Americans not only as a means of expressing cultural pride but also for awareness of their state of extreme poverty. Major Failures: AIM, like the Black Panthers, established armed patrols to protect Indians from harassment by the police. "Brown Power" was for Mexican-Americans who wished to express their cultural pride and to express discontent for their poor working conditions in the fields and their people's inequality in the education system, particularly the fact that the schools should be bilingual. Major Successes: Their efforts led to betters wages of field hands and strengthened ethnic consciousness among Mexican-Americans The "Black Power," "Red Power," and "Brown Power" movements did not sustain the intense activism and media attention that they attracted in the late sixties. The three movements succeeded in raising the consciousness of the young generation as a result improving the cultural pride of each group. The failure of all three groups was that the revolts caused many deaths and government action to control them. The deaths did cause a realization by many Americans of how strongly the people felt about their cultures but they were still losses. I do believe that we are better off today because of these movements, issues were raised that no longer could be avoided. Society had to face the music and deal with some major issues that were going on at that time. I don’t believe that movements were divisive since the fight was for equality.

The Red power movement was a movement by the native americans demanding retribution for stolen lands, harsh conditions, and constant lies.  The Brown movement was led  by the Mexican-Americans who desired cultural equality and respect.  While African and Mexican Americans have both obtained some of their goals that these movements provoked, sadly native american and U.S. government relations have only grown worse.

===message:Compare the Black Power, Red Power, and Brown Power movements of the later 1960s. To what extent did they differ? What were the major successes and failures of these groups? Are people "better off" today because of these movements? To what extent were these movements more divisive than helpful? 

i think that each of these movements brought self respect to its people. yet caused a division amongst them. they alienated themselves from everyone else in the midst of these movements, which actually didn't help them to become apart of what they were seeking to become. for instance the african americans were influenced by those of malcom x and h rap brown as well as stokely to disassociate themselves from the white devel. while the mexicans instited that they be referred to as chicanos following cesar chavez. and the indians instited on being called native americans rightfully so., i think it brought them closer together as a people. by giving them a sense of belongingness. they fought to get what was rightfully theirs and education consisting of native american studies. the native americans fought for land that had been stolen, the chicanos for their name, land, and fair education with bilingual studies. the african americans got a sense of black pride. the recognized that black is beautiful. that it was okay and to have coiled hair rather than recessive. they stopped trying to be something other than what they were and they loved themselves for this. each of these movements fought for the arrest of police brutality. these movements did not sustain the impactful activism and media attention that was needed leading to their failure however not within their cultures. their cultures benefitted tremendously. i think people are better off. each group has formed a unity that they didn't have before. this unity has helped them to reach goals that have made life easier for them. although these minorities are rapidly become a majority collectively, there are still issues that cause them all to press on with there effort. only recently like the past few years, african americans seem to have rediscovered their natural beauty. the are starting to wear their naturally coiled beautiful hair as is whether locked or free or braided. they seem to show a certain self pride that is remarkable. the movements gave these groups strength which have gotten us all to the point we're at today.

They seem to differ in that the black and red power movements had a more militant presence while the brown power movement would appear to follow a more peaceful path. While all of these groups helped to bring a certain amount of attention to there respective causes none were able to maintain long term involvement from members. They also failed to bring total equality among all the people. I guess that the people that belong to those groups are to some degree better off because of the efforts of the groups. As for divisive side it looks to me like if a group wants another group of people to change it’s mindset and become more accepting of the first group then waving a gun in someone’s face is not the best way to achieve it.

===message:The Black Power movement evolved out of the feelings of disappointment and bitterness over the slow change in improvement of life for blacks and the continued white opposition to it.  Malcolm X became a symbol of the ideology igniting blacks with ideas that whites were devils and that separation and black empowerment as the only means of attainment in the U.S.  "By any means necessary", became the slogan of this era as well as self-esteem, pride, and respect for being black.  The Red Power movement sought a more peaceful means of ensuring that Native Americans, as they demanded to be called, received preferential hiring, Native American studies in colleges, and governmental reimbursement for lands that had been taken away from them.  Some Native Americans took a more militant stand using tactics of direct action and confrontation adopted by the civil-rights movement.  The Brown Power movement also followed a nonviolent path for Mexican-Americans.  C'esar Cha'vez became a leader of this movement when he became founded the United Farm Workers.  His goal to improve working conditions and gain union recognition for farm workers.  Younger Mexican-Americans followed the examples of more radical Black Power organizations like the Black Panthers in making demands for cultural equality and rights like bicultural education in schools, control of their environment and communities.  Major successes of the Black Power movement was the surge of black pride and the new-found interest in African culture.  Other advances occured such as Black studies programs in colleges and universities.  Failures would be that these positve cultural feelings did not maintain through the years and the ability to define destiny was not achieved.  Most whites did not change their views, and although policy changes in government made vast improvements, this was only short lived and not due to the movement.  The Red Power movement was able to convince government via President Johnson to seek greater aid for Native Americans and were able to gain control of their own affairs. Their failures are that they were not able to reclaim any lands illegally taken.  The Brown Power movements' successes would be their ablity to control their own enviroments including the demand to be called Chicano and intergration of billingual education in their schools.  Failures would be the inablity to have total control of their schools, agencies that would administer to their peoples' needs, and police treatment of their people.  The more militant these movement became and more violence they advocated in order to reach their goals, the more divisive they were.  There were those from each movement who favored a more nonviolent path to gaining rights and those who felt that the only way to get what you want is to take it.  Unfortunately, those in power look down on these violent acts and use them as foder to not assist in efforts for equality.  Those who go to such lengths to make demands are seen as unAmerican and unworthy of anything but disdain.  This also causes issues within the community of people the movement is there to help.

===message:From what I understand from the text of the guidebook, it seems that all three groups had been protesting and demanding social reform for quite some time.  From a history book point of view, it seems that the Black power movement has received more attention than the Red and Brown power movements.  I was not alive during those years but it seems logical to assume that this is how it really happened.  It seems that the Red power movement was more centralized in the widwest to pacific coast states, although there was some lobbying in Washington DC.  The Brown movement seems to be located mainly in the states western states.  I do not even remember reading about any lobbying for "Mexican-American rights, although I am sure that there was.  Another big difference in the Black Power movement and the other two was the extent of the militancy of it.  This may be due to the fact that the Black Power movement received more press but they seem to have been much more violent than the other power movements.  I believe that these movements did help their people in that they helped to revive the heritage and culture of these people and helped them realize that they did not have to be ascimilated into "white America."  However, I believe that they may have retarded the quest for equality by resorting to violence.  Who knows, reform may have never come about if they had not.  In my opinion when they turned to violence, they shifted their goals.  The quest for equality turned into a desire for superiority.  I see this in many feminist orgaizations today.  Some (NOT ALL!!) no longer want to be considered equals, but will settle for nothing less that a completely matriarchal society.  In the end, these movements for Black, Red and Brown power did bring about an increased awareness of the need for reform.  The determination and violence helped many people see that some were willing to fight for what they wanted.  Even though many people came to support their causes, they had to have alienated some people with their terroristic activities.

===message:For the "Black Power" movement, the greates success would be that it gave the blacks a sense of self-pride.  For many, the phrase, "Black Power", helped African Americans shape there own culture and define their own destiny.  I would say that the failure was some of the teachings by Malcolm X, which told them to rely on armed self-defense rather than non-violence and to seperate themselves from the white man, which in return, was racism in itself.  For the Native Americans("Red Power"), their successes came from publicizing their plight to earn self-respect and cultural pride.   They explained that they suffered the worst poverty, the highest disease and death rates, and the poorest education and housing of any group in the U.S.  This resulted in the establishment of the National Council on Indian Opportunity which channeled anti-poverty funds into the Indian communities.  This was a great accomplishment for the Native Americans.  For the "Brown Power", one of their great successes came from Cexar Chavez, which fought for union recognition and improved working conditions for farm laborers.  His efforts, resulted in better wages for field hands and strengthened ethnic consciousness among Mexican-Americans.  The African Americans differed from the other's because they received more recognition and rights, even to this day, than the Mexican-Americans and the Native Americans.  To some extent these movements were more devisive because they set apart each minority group in a way that seperated them from other groups.  It almost provoked hatred to other races rather than unity.

===message:The Black power movement derived from the teachings of Malcolm X who urged African-Americans to be proud of their blackness and their African roots. Blacks, he proclaimed, must control their own destinies, rely on armed self-defense rather than nonviolence, and seize their freedom "by any means necessary."  SNCC H. Rap Brown, also encourage African Americans that the only way blacks could get justice and fair treatment was through the barrel of a gun. Radicals groups such as the Black Panthers were formed to protect protestors from police brutality. This was all done in the name of “Self Pride”.

The Red power movement was organized by Indian activists to encourage Indians to protest self- respect and cultural pride. The American Indian Movement was formed which emphasize Indians' right to control their own affairs. AIM also formed patrol to protect the Indians from harassment from the police. 

Cesar Chavez led the Brown power movement. His quest for Mexicans-Americans was to gain union recognition and improved working conditions for farm laborers. His protests and tactics were all non-violent. Younger Mexicans-Americans took a different route. As a mark of respect for their ethnic identity, Mexican-Americans demanded to be called Chicanos. They also formed a group called the Brown Berets which insisted control: "control over our environment; control over our schools so that our children can receive a better education; control over the agencies which are supposed to be administering to the needs of our people; control over the police whose salaries we pay but who continually brutalize our people." 

All three groups were protesting cultural pride. Along with that, the Indian’s also protested land, the Mexican wouldn’t better working conditions and the African Americans wanted racial change. 

The major successes were, cultural and self-identity among the groups. Also, having the ability to form organizations to fight and protect the rights of people in a non-violent way. Unfortunately, for the Indians, the fight for land appears insoluble. 

Yes, people are better off today because of self-pride and knowing that they can be what they want to be, and if they work hard at it. 

These movements were helpful, because it pulled a race together to fight a common cause. These movements allowed people to stand along and fight for what they believe. On the other hand, Non-violent vs. violent was the extent of division. Although all the groups were fighting at the same time for the same cause, different actions were taking.

===message:The Black, Red, and Brown Power movement started in the 1960s and made quite an impression on the era.  As African-Americans, Native Indians, and Chicanos begin to dissiminate a strong cultural pride throughout their society, they begin to demand rights that were being enjoyed by White Americans.  From these movements, strong cultural organizations such as the SCLC, the SNCC, AIM, and the United Farm Workers, were all created.  These organizations helped to create an arena where minorities could voice their feelings of deprivation and unfair treatment.  The advantage, of having these empowerments of Black, Red, and Brown power, was that it gave each group a way to nurture the young in their society and continue their cultural pride.  They created channels that their voices could use to speak out about rights as people of  America.   People are better off because we are not where we were in the struggles of the '60s.  All groups have made advancements and cause Americans to see them as more of an equal.  The harm that these movements nurtured was a further division of people rather than a "coming together" of people as Americans.

Many of these people were justified in their feelings, but some were wrong in the way that they vented their frustration.  The obvious way that these groups and movements differed was their race, but it also included, to some degree, where the movements took place and to what extent that the movements were successful.  As mentioned in the readings, the movements died out after the sixties, but they all succeeded in gaining the attention and promoting awareness and some sympathy for their cause.  Along with that, these groups helped unite their culture, which would later help all of these groups organize into a political force.  It is because of this organization and the eventual political influence that this organization gained that has helped people today.  Many more African Americans, Latin Americans, and Native Americans are represented in politics, whether it is through Congress, the House of Representatives, or on a more local level.  The Black Power movement is the movement that seemed more divisive to myself.  The creation of the Black Panthers created more hostilities towards African Americans.

"Black Power" was successful in terms of raising feelings of self-pride among its members and as a result universites began to offer "black studies".  "Red Power" gained a response from President Johnson in the form of a National Council on Indian Opportunity being established in 1965 to help funnel anit-poverty funds back to indian communities.  Finally, "Brown Power" was useful by Chavez in calling for better wages for field workers. They all had a similiar weakness in that their movements did not flourish and prosper past the late 60's.  I think that these movements had their place in history and served to rally the pride of their members, allowing them to call for action and draw attention to their strife.  I think that if these groups had joined forces in calling for equal treatment and rights they would have been more powerful than they were on their own and the movements would have had more momentum and endured past the 60's, and in that extent they were more divisive than helpful.

I despise violence and am saddened by the fear that it creates, and I have much greater repect for those who commit to stand strong with nonviolence as Dr. King did. I'm ambivalent about the militance of the Black Power movement. I do think that it is divisive and fosters mistrust. But there are only so many racially motivated beatings, only so many restrictions and hostilities expressed by whites before young men are fed up and decide to take a stand. In the face of violence, few have the vision to see beyond "by any means necessary" to bring discrimination to an end. I don't see that the Red Power movement had significant success. I feel that the Native American struggle has barely begun. As for the Brown Power movement, I think that great strides were made at the time for change in the West. But I've seen migrant workers' conditions in South Florida today, and it's difficult to detect lasting change. I think that the driving force forward for Latinos will come from South Florida, as the Latin population has defied all traditional patterns of assimilation with phenomenal success there. And I look to Atlanta for the most lasting change for African Americans. In the end, I think that liberation is largely dependent on economic success and Miami and Atlanta provide a forum for these groups.

The Black Power movement was a violent one, in order for the African Americans to get their point across, they turned to violence.  And violence is never the answer to any problem.  I felt extremely sorry for the Native Americans, because the government just took their land.  It's not like these people were doing something destructive to it; it was their home.  Their movement was a nonviolent one.  The Brown Power movement was also nonviolent.  It was started because the Mexican Americans wanted respect for their ethnicity.  These three movements didn't last but for a few years.  What was so bad was that the equality they were all fighting for didn't even occur during those years, but they did mark the beginning of how everything is today.  Each movement did bring their people closer together to fight for what they believed in, which was good.  Of course people are much better off today.  Mostly everybody can look pass other people's race.  There are laws that protect people from discrimination and unequality, although things that involve these issues still happen til this day.  It'll be like that for many more years.  These movements were more divisive than helpful in the case that the people involved in each movement mainly stayed within their own groups.  I believe the people in these movements should have worked together to fight for their rights, instead of staying separate, and maybe things would have worked out a little bit better, and a whole lot sooner.

===message:The Black, Red, and Brown Power Movements had a common goal which was to promote pride in their heritage and to protect their civil rights.  The Black power movements were at times counter productive to what they were trying to accomplish{looting& Burning properties}.  The Red Power wanted some assistance because statitics showed they were most inflicted with poverty and disease.  The Brown Power movement wanted to have better schools and better communities for their children.  Some of the movements have had a positive affect on today's society.  MLK promoted awareness to the plight of blacks, and Cesar Chavez helped Mexican Americans.  These three different powers focused on the issues regarding their specific race and not addressing the issue as a whole.  These groups are all considered minorities and may have helped had they united in a joint cause to ensure to protection of their civil rights and to encourage people to learn about their their different cultures.

===message:Not until I read the Course Guidebook did I ever hear about Brown Power and Red Power.  This refers to the Mexican Americans and the Indian Americans who fought against discrimination.  I think I didn't hear about them because the Black Power movement was more radical.  I have always lived in the South also.  Maybe that has something to do with it.  Brown Power and Red Power movements generally happened out west.  I do believe that each movement happened for a reason and had an effect on where were are today.  I also believe that the Black Power movement set at precedent for the others and created equality not only for blacks, but for other minorities too.  So the answer is yes, that each movement helped society's position today.

===message:Black Power, Red Power and Brown Power were all attempting to further the cause of equality for their group of people, namely African-Americans, Native Americans and Mexican-Americans respectively.  While each was striving for their equality, they also had their own specific agendas.  While Blacks were demanding equality in education and social status, Native Americans also wanted the return of some of their lands that they felt were wrongly taken from them by the U.S. government.  Mexican-Americans were trying to get recognized unions and better working conditions for farm labor.  While these movements united these people, they also caused rifts within the groups, particularly between the more passionate believers and the more conservative people, usually the older generation.  People are better off today because of the media attention that was brought to these concerns by the movements.  While they may not have gotten everything they were seeking right away, they did get much of what they were seeking over time.

===message:The Black Power movement emerged out of fury and frustration over the progress of civil rights in America. It later evolved into an expression of self-pride and self-help for most Blacks.  Red Power and Brown Power mimicked the Black Power tactics to help further their cause.  The movements differed only in cultural backgrounds.
<p>
Black power was more of a revolution because of the violent social uprisings in cities across the U.S.  Most black were frustrated with the seemingly minimal progress of the civil rights movement and the poverty of the ghettos.  I think the sentiment of that time was peaceful solutions for six years have not worked…let’s try force by any means necessary.  Red and Brown Power in contrast was much more peaceful and gained faster results from President Johnson’s administration.
<p>
The successes of the Black Power movement was the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 24th Amendment; the failure was the riots and widespread militant groups who hurt the chances for more government programs to improve ghetto conditions.  The successes of Red Power were the creation of the American Indian Movement, the Declaration of Purposes which encouraged Johnson to establish the National Council on Indian Opportunity in 1965 to channel antipoverty funds in Indian communities.  The Brown power movement successes were the United Farm Workers efforts that led to better wages for field hands.
<p>
Yes people are better off today because of these movements.  For instance Blacks can vote more, compete for jobs more, and get a college education wherever they choose.  I think Oprah Winfrey is a beneficiary of these movements, being the first black female billionaire in this country.
<p>
The civil rights movement forced White America to recognize the plight of the other cultures.  In the case of the Black Power movement militant groups wanted to be separate and in control of their own communities by force,  this proved to be more divisive than helpful because it resulted in Johnson’s administration abandoning further government funding aimed at eradicating minority poverty.

===message:During the 1960's there wasn't much difference between Black Power, Brown Power, and Red Power. All three classes were fighting for equal rights, better education, voting rights, and for the right to be recognized as a people and shape their own cultures. Black Power staged their fight with organized sit-ins that caused many white americans to realize that they were a vital part of the communities they lived in. These sit-ins, such as the Montgomery Bus strike (start of the civil rights movement)crippled cities and caused them to have financial setbacks. Although, sit-ins and strikes and a non-violence approach seemed to work, many believed that force was necessary to obtain equal justice. The Brown Power movement staged their fight through vocal demands for better schools, no police brutality and to be recoginized as a Chicano people. They established their own education sytems, organized strikes with farm labors for equal pay, and better work conditions. The Red Power movement staged their fight similar to the civil rights movement. They believed that direct action and confrontation was necessary to obtain their goals. They attempted to take back their lands that they believed the "White Man" took from them. The major success of each group was their determination to be recogized as a people and their continued will to fight on with their cause. From each group and their struggles, I believe that there weren't any failures. Each group stood up for their beliefs, and their heritage. African Americans have come a long way since the 1960's, but the civil rights fight is still being waged. This fight isn't for just black people's equality but all races, sex and religions. Until Affrimative Action isn't necessary in this country, Black Power, Brown Power, Red Power, Women Rights group and other organizations will continue to wage war against discrimination.

===message:Black Power, Red Power, and Brown power were very similar in that they all were geared toward the equality of each of the races that they represented.  Black Power appears to have made more progress than Brown Power or Red Power.  There have been major strides may be black citizens (less poverty in the black community, more economic opportunities for blacks).  Red Power seems to have lacked the push necessary to make a "major" movement towards equality.  There is still more prejudice against Native Americans in this world.  They are the "silent minority".  Brown Power appears to have a solid impact on the Mexican and Hispanic community.  Brown power could have had more of an impact if more of the Hispanics took an active part in the movement for equality.  I believe that because they have more issues relating to citizenship, they are not able to fully harness the power of the Hispanic community.  People are better off today than they were in the society of the 50s and 60s which sought to keep people of color (brown, red, or black) down.  These individual movements were not divisive in my opinion because they're not promoting separatism but are only looking to improve the situations of the individual "genres".

===message:Although the "Power Movements" were all movements by different groups to make advancements for their people and Black Power seemed to pave the way for the Red and Brown Power movements to form, almost a "if they can do we can" type mentality.  I believe that the Native Americans and Mexican Americans saw the strength of the African American's movement as inspiring and therefor persued their own agendas.  Black Power leaned towards violence and a need for a sense of identity for African Americans who had a need to shape their own culture and define their own destiny that had been predetermined for them by society for so long.  They strived to become an active part of the American society.  Native Americans, however, didn't long to become part of what they often called the "white man's world".  Though blacks were mistreated, the volumes of injustices against Native Americans far surpassed them.  Although blacks in America started with nothing and had to fight to gain it, Natives had "everything" and the United States literally took it from them with no conscience at all.  Such things as the Manhattan Island purchase in 1626 showed the lack of intergrity of the U.S.  vs the unmodernized and trusting ways of the Indians.  Natives fought for fishing rights, preferential hiring, studies of their cultures in colleges and government reimbursement for lands that whites illegally took from then in direct violation of laws and treaties!!!!  Mexican Americans main fight seemed to be of improved working conditions but they also addressed that of control over the same aspects of their lives as both the Black and Red Power.

Through these movements commissions and councils were formed to address the issues and actions taken by the government to give "more" benefits thereto.  The most powerful of the movements was Black Power.  Although I stand by the fact that I believe through tainted leadership the movement has been distorted, the voice of the African Americans' fight has been heard more than that of the Red of Brown.  I believe that the U.S. was forced to face the issues of blacks, wanted to forget totally about what they did to indians and strive on the fact that chicanos kind of "stay to themselves".
