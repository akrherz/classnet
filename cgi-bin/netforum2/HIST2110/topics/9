===more:What were the causes of the anticommunist hysteria that swept the nation in the late 1940s and early 1950s? Why did McCarthyism receive so much support? Why are Americans so prone to panic? Relate this question to events of post-9/11/01. (Be sure to include references to duct tape and plastic sheeting.)
