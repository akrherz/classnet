===message:Anticommunism dominated the Truman administration's agenda and was the main focus of political battles for presdiency.  Anticommunism was conformed to by the government and each side fought to be the primary advocate for it.  Television, magazines, and newspapers covered anticommunist topics daily and encouraged Americans to support anticommunist ideas.  The government made decisions to seek out informants and spies and charge them with espionage and treason.  Not all acts of the government were supported by evidence, especially those acts of Joe McCarthy, but the hysteria of Americans had risen so quickly and so greatly that no one dared to speak negatively about the government's actions for fear of being punished themselves.  The government set examples of what they would do to pro-communists through the execution of the Rosenberg's and through dramatically sifting through and terminating government employees on a regular basis.  McCarthyism was supported greatly by all Americans for fear of the consequences if they did not support it.  I feel that Americans are so prone to hysteria because the government creates it in a lot of cases.  For instance, our government is now encouraging us to buy plastic sheeting and duct tape to cover our homes in case of germ warfare.  To my surprise, a lot of people are doing it!  I feel that if it is going to happen, there's not a whole lot that plastic and tape can do to prevent us from either getting sick or dying.  We cannot live in our homes in fear on a daily basis.  We were shocked by the events of 9/11 and the government has now decided that since Americans were so angry about what happened on 9/11, they must go that extra mile to be sure they are not blamed for another catastrophy.  We are a nation rallied to fight terrorism and war, but we're having to fight a war within our own country just to feel safe.

===message:Several factors contributed to the anticommunist hysteria that swept the United States. First, American politics played the major role, because they convinced people that communism was running rampant world wide and they needed to get control of the situation or it would take over in the states. Second, Russia, a communist nation, was gaining power and this movement concerned the United States deeply, because they worried that Russia would get too powerful and destroy America. McCarthyism received so much attention; because he convinced people that communism was still running rampant. He spoke out against Truman and the government to no end and people started to listen to what McCarthy was saying. We want our children to live in a country that is safe and when the cause is put into jeopardy, we go into a panic.

===message:Americans believed that our country had been infiltrated by  teason and subversion which they contributed to the cause of foreign difficulties. They were angry with the executive administration for not being aggressive enough to prevent China from becoming communist,and the fact that the Soviets had built and exploded their own atomic bomb only increased fear in Americans. Americans had been through a lot,and after World War II they were suspicious of any New Deal purposed, they believe it to be a communist plot to sovietize America. Anyone who acted, talked, thought,or associated with certain groups were classified as communist,and if one was simpatheic toward civil rights, your affiliation was questionable. The Cold War caused legitmate concerns about American security. When the discovery of communistic agents working in the Federal government president Truman mandated the "Truman Doctrine" establishing the Federal Employee Loyalty Program to root out subversives in government service. The revelation of the Hollywood 10, the Hiss, Rosenbergs,Fuch,and others communist episodes struck panic at home. Americans didn't know who to trust,so when Republican Senator McCarthy started his rebell rousing everyone got on the band wagon. He was making the kind of noise Americans wanted to hear.McCarthys accusations of communist weren't valid in most cases, nor did he produce evidence to support his finger pointing,it was totally a political diversion to enhance his potential political career, at the same time putting down the current administration in office. 
As far as the post 911 ordeal,and duck tape thing I am clueless, because if something is going to happen in a America be it physical destruction or germ warfare what type of protection can one get from DUCK TAPE?

===message:The contributing factor of the anticommunism hysteria was the emergence of Russia as a legitimate "Super Power".  Going straight to the bottom line President Truman and Stalin were involved in a major pee contest and their fear/dislike or unwillingness to coexist filtered down to the American people.  The spread of communism was a major threat to the democratic government of the U.S. and being associated with communisim was viewed as assisting the enemy.  A legitimate threat leads to fear, fear leads to hatred, hatred produces hysteria.  For example if the weather forcast calls for a major snow storm in Georgia you will not be able to find a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread in the metro area.  Just as our current state of hysteria, out of the fear of biological warfare the consumption of duct tape and plastic is off the scale.  Americans are so prone to panic because of fear.  That same fear is what makes people naturally believe the worst case scenerio.

Our European allies were wrecked militarily and Americans just wanted the troops to come home.

<p>With the uncovering of a communist spy ring that handed over atomic secrets to our cold war adversary, there was legitimate reason to battle espionage, but the ferver spread beyond simply espionage and subversion to an idealist witch hunt for anyone who leaned too far too the left. Senator McArthy stoked the fires for political gain as did other hard line Republicans. The result was a public in open panic of communist infiltrators, and the government trampling of Constiutional rights was ignored by a populace in mortal fear.</p>
<p>I think the current political climate bears numerous differences than the communist scare. The population is not in a complete panic and fright of foreign terrorism. The potential is there, but we have not yet gone that far down the road to repression. I think Americans currently see the reasons for vigilance, but also see that we are capable of protecting ourselves. I don't see fear of terrorism as comperable to the rampant fear of communism as an almost unstoppable force of global domination. Of course there are always extreme people who are easily driven to panic, but my household is secure in the knowledge that we are more likely to be involved in a car wreck than a terrorist attack. We wear our seatbelts, but don't own any gas masks. Our cars have airbags, but we like the nice spring air too much to put plastic on the windows.</p>

===message:The causes of the anticommunist hysteria were the Chinese communists takeover of China, Soviets exploding their own atomic bomb, and the U.S. political campaign.  When China became the People's Republic of China, it signified that U.S. efforts to stop communism failed.  When the Soviets exploded its own atomic bomb, it signified its determination to flex its power and maybe transmit some fear in the U.S.  However, when the U.S. government examined its own administration for any disloyalty and proclaim a campaign againist communism, anticommunism hysteria swept the nation (HUAC investigations; many states enacted antisubversion laws and loyalty programs).  McCarthyism received so much support because it was appealing and Americans believed or wanted to believe that the country's foreign difficulties were to due to treason.  Americans are prone to panic because of fear and because its created by our government and media.  To suggest that we go out and buy duct tape and plastic sheeting to protect ourselves against biological warfare just doesn't make sense.  Although these items would not be defense, many individuals did go out and buy the materials and believe they are life-saving items.

===message:I feel the causes of the anticommunist hysteria could be linked to the quick enforcement of communism in certain countries (mainly Poland) and the announcement that Russia also had an atomic bomb and then also an h-bomb.  The American people could not figure out why its government was having a hard time keeping Stalin under some sort of control.  The introduction of possible multiple spy networks, one in the U.S. and one in Canada, did nothing but feed the fear of the American people.  McCarthyism received support because these fears had finally been realized.  The Federal Employee Loyalty Program brought on a whole new look at things for the people.  The loosely lead program immediately started forcing the resignation of employees for things as simple as having a friend of a friend of a friend that was a little suspicious.  The public as a whole only saw that thousands government employees were forced to resign, meaning, in their eyes, there was a major problem with Democratic leadership of the country.  I think that one major reason Americans are prone to panic is the feeling that we are bound to be attacked.  I have heard from numerous people that until 9/11, America had really been “lucky” in escaping the terrorist of so many other countries.  Once 9/11 happened, these same people felt like if it happened once, it would happen again; hence the reason for the mad dash to the store for duct tape and plastic.  The United States of America has been seen for decades as the dominating force of the world, why wouldn’t some egotistical country want to try to take control of that title?

Additionally, the fear in the 40s that a communist might live next door is similar to the fear these days that the guy sitting next to you on the plane might try to hijack it.

Communism appeared to be an epidemic. Alarmed by communist expansion, the United States and it's allies began giving military and economic aid to non-communist countries and pledge to help nations threatened by communist take-over. McCarthyism was supported greatly because the American people still had a distrust in the government. The 911 incident terrorize most Americans to believe that we are not safe in our own country. Because we are considered a super-power, we never had to worry about fighting a war on our own turf. 911 helped us the realize that we are not exempt from terrorists attacks.

===message:The anticommunist hysteria had its beginnings with the establishment of the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1938. Truman's Executive Order 9835 brought further unrest. This order established the Federal Employee Loyalty Program. Although geared towards loyalty checks on government employees, it soon spread to all other areas of the American work force, including schoolteachers and college professors. While there was good reason for concern and some sort of safeguards needed to be in place, the Federal Employee Loyalty Program had weak measures to insure civil rights. This gave way to what I am sure were many injustices that were served during this time of paranoia by the American people. Some accusation and treats were made and lives ruined based on nothing but their association with others. The Hollywood 10 were sent to federal prison simply because they did not cooperate. Was any evidence of wrongdoing brought against them? Others were outcast simply because they were Jews. The Dennis v. US decision threatened freedom of speech. Then, in an effort for political gain, McCarthy began his attacks on elected officials. He received encouragement from other 
Republicans strictly for the purpose of winning the 1952 election for the Republican party. Had Truman's political views been more popular, McCarthy probably would not have been able to gain the support that he did. To many Republicans, anticommunist was a weapon against the Democrats. American is prone to panic just as any other country is prone to panic. It is the human instinct for self-preservation. In relating to 9/11 Americans are not the only ones who have been placed on alert. The entire world with the exception of terrorists supporters, has responded with fear of who might be living next door, who might work in your building with you, who might work in the post office, who is flying the plane. This list goes on and on and no matter how much duck tape or plastic sheeting is used nothing can stop what is already written.

===message:The causes of anticommunist hysteria that swept the United States began as a result of the American public’s fear of the atomic bomb.  Americans feared the destructive nature of the atomic bomb, but more so, they feared that the power and devastation of this bomb was now in the hands of another country.  Furthermore, the fact that they no longer had the monopoly on the atomic bomb and later the hydrogen bomb, made America equal in world matters- no longer could America yield the destructive might they once solely possessed.  America once again had to compromise.  McCarthyism received so much support for two reasons.  The first reason lies in the inability for the American public to rationally think through things at times.  Americans were scared of what they had no control over, thus they followed whomever they felt could gain control.  The second reason for the acceptance of McCarthyism and probably the true reason that it received so much support were because of the power that it had and the injustice that it served.  Many people were scared of not being supportive of McCarthyism.  After all, those who did not support McCarthyism’s removal of communism must be communist themselves.  Americans are prone to panic when they are taken out of their comfort zone.  We do not know how to react when things do not always go our way.  This relates to the events of 9-11 because it took us out of our comfort zones.  The duct tape and plastic sheeting are ways to make ourselves comfortable that we cannot be harmed.

according to the department of homeland panic, they inform you on how to preserve your loved ones body should they perish in a terroristic attack. they suggest that you wrap the body in plastic sheeting and seal with duck tape, then put the body in the basement and wait for government officials to pick up the body. another source suggests that we should invest in plastic sheeting and duck tape wrap our homes up and seal with duck tape in the event that a biological, chemical, or radiational attack should hit the u.s. some would exclaim that this IS EVIDENCE OF THE U.S.'S COMMON PANIC.

Following WWII Americans feared any threat to freedom whether it be found in an atomic bomb in Russia, a communist China or the unsubstantial fears of the uninformed American.  McCarthyism received so much attention because people were afraid and didnt know who to trust or listen to.  It is convenient that senator McCarthy appeared with all the answers and the enlightened knowledge of who in America was communist, I say this jokingly of course.  Americans love to panic.  But more than panic, Americans like to feel like they have control over the situation.  Much like during the Cuban missile crisis, American children were told that if a missile hits, get under your desk and cover your head.  Im no balistics expert, but something tells me that if a missile hits, crawling under my desk and covering my head is not going to save me.  It is almost in the way that it mirrors the idea of duct tape and plastic sheeting saving me from biochem warfare.  Again im no expert, but this is utterly ridiculous.  Another example of panic, was post 9/11 and the fear of getting in an airplane.  Terrorism, is just that, the infliction of terror.  So by not getting in an airplane, terrorism was affecting you and not the other way around.

The reason why McCarthyism received so much support is because he informed his fellow Republicans that the Democrats were being too easy on the communists. When he filed a suit against several women he thought were communists after attending a GOP meeting West Virginia, his effort to prove that communism existed in the GOP, gained support of many Americans. 

Americans are so prone to panic because we live in a country where our government is unjust and dishonest and a time where the possibility of any type of threat on our soil is unimagined and unrealized. The Civil War and the Pearl Harbor attacks are the last major incidents on our soil the effects of both have been long forgotten by the average American. This is why such panic arose when the September 11th attacks happened.  So many Americans stopped going to work, took their children out of school, bought enormous amounts of groceries and supplies from the store until they thought is was safe again. Also when the government informed the public of the possible threat of biological weapons from terrorists and made suggestions to prevent infection, Americans bought massive quantities of duct tape and plastic sheeting.

===message:I think that the anticommunist hysteria of the 1940's and early 1950's was able to go on because of the backing of the government.  Russia, who was the enemy, was communist so anything communist obviously was also the enemy.  By placing this idea and fear of domination by communism into the American people, different government officals were able to gain trust and backing including the President.  People like to feel that they are being looked after and protected, as well as wanting to protect.  President Truman portrayed himself as a protector of the free world thereby a protector of the American people.  Others like McCarty were able to exploit this panic and hysteria to their advantage by pointing a finger at others to gain confidence and support from people.  You were either with McCarty, or you were a communist.  Being a communist meant, fines, jail, unemployment, even death.  Being loyal meant prosperity.  Which would you choose.  It seems very similar to mafia tactics of paying for protection.  American seem very prone to panic based on a mass paranoia.  When something bad happens like the threat of war, Russia matching America's atomic and hydrogen bombs, China taken over by a Communist power, we panic.  The fact that there were indeed some Americans who sympathized with the communist ideology and some spys and traiters to the U.S only served to fuel the fire for those in government who wanted to get ahead.  I have worked for the state for the past ten and a half years.  About two months ago my office mailed out a form to be signed and sent back in.  Upon reading the form and the State Constitutions citing it was from, I discovered firsthand that Georgia is one of the states that requires it's federal and state employees to sign an Oath the State and U.S. Constitutions.  After ten years, I think it's a bit late and I was very insulted.  Coworkers of mine felt that it really made no differnce to them as long as they continued to get a paycheck.  Now I see where this bit of legislature came from and I am very upset at having to sign it.  Obviously, the effects of 9/11/01 and the possibility of War with Iraq spurred this new resurgence of signing this oath.  Working full time, attending school and raising a family really puts me out of the loop sometimes because I was totally confused when I went to Walmart about a month ago and saw everyone in line with water, duct tape, and plastic.  I asked my husband who is an ex-marine( if there is such a thing) and army man why everyone was purchasing these items.  He told me that it was mass hysteria and the idea that covering your home with the plastic sheeting and duck tape would keep out chemical warfare.  He also told me that this was nonsense and would not work.  Since he was in the Desert Storm operation, I tended to listen to him.  The "fight or flight" reaction is in our nature as human beings.  Any signs of possible danger, puts us in a state of panic.  Unfortunately, sometimes the media and unscrupulous people in buisnesses and even government play on that fear in order to lead us in the desired directions or take advantage of us for their own gains.

The American government used this fear of the unknown to gain support of the American people to drive the government to become stronger with fewer restrictions than were previously in place.  For instance, the fear of communists allowed for government investigations to be allowed to run rampant.   McCarthyism received support because McCarthy seemed to be trying to inform the American public about things the government was trying to hide, he seemed to play upon the true blue American spirit.  Americans are prone to panic because we feel powerless to defend ourselves as individuals.  We have never before had to realisiticaly worry about invaisions in our homes and communities.  After 9/11 our nation suffered in the aftermath of the knowledge that people really do hate us and that we are not as safe as we once believed.  Most of us are used to an ideal life (in comparision to other countries, not our ultra rich and powerful) where few are hungry and homeless and at the hands of rebel forces.

Make up some hearings, call some people communists, and watch the American public revel in all the glory of catching a so called communist.  After 9/11 it took a long while to get things back to normal in our homeland.  Panic is just a common reaction from people that think they are invisible to suck attacks.  9/11 opened our eyes and made us realize that we are susceptible to being attacked.  Thus, we all had a little bit of panic in the back of our minds.  It is hard not to panic when CNN is running 24 hour coverage of the same "propaganda" over and over.

It was quite easy to blame the Russians for some our war woes - didn't they break several promises to us?  Because they were against democracy and all things that were held dear by Americans they were considered a threat.  We certainly wouldn't want to be drawn into another war.  They would have to be stopped!  Unfortunately all of the propoganda of the time (including McCarthyism) likely gave Americans a biased view of the Russians.  This is in no way meant to say that the Russians were simply misunderstood.  However if we fear the unknown, then Russia was certainly bound to cause mistrust. We are a very patriotic country.  This means that we tend to hop on any bandwagon with a God Bless America bumper sticker.  While this is not always a bad thing we must always investigate issues for ourselves.  Consider the issue of people buying mass quantities of duct tape and plastic sheeting.  If chemical warfare uses gasses that are odorless and colorless, then how do we know when to cover our windows.  And what do we do once we run out of air in our sealed homes?  For that matter when do don our gas masks.  The name of the game is information.  Not the bombardment that we have now.  Every television channel and radio station has constant "up to the minute" updates on the war.  I believe this fuels some of the mass panic that we seem to be prone to. While chemical warfare is a very real possibility/danger, we need to stop and think and quit buying into the gloom and doom being broadcast at us. We do indeed live in perilous times but will we stop living or worse yet live in fear for the remainder of our lives?

The aggression by the USSR and its will to exact its communist beliefs throughout Europe and parts of Asia caused a widespread mistrust of communism. Also, the creation of the atomic and hydrogen bombs by the Soviet Union further deepened the mistrust of the communist state because the United States no longer had supreme dominancy over the world. McCarthyism received a lot of support because the people of the U.S. were afraid of being accused of being communist and being blacklisted. Americans are prone to panic because we are afraid of being taken away from our comfort zones and when a traumatic incident occurs within this country (as in 9/11) it propels the American people to fear the propaganda that is exploited by the media and some leaders. This can be related to when the Americans during this timeframe conducted nuclear bomb drills and the creation of bomb shelters.

Also, increasing tensions between the Soviet Union and the West, specifically America, helped to further fan the flames of anticommunist hysteria.  McCarthyism received enormous support because it fed on people’s existing fears about communism.  The people of America went on a search for anyone who they thought might be communist because they feared these people would try to overthrow the government.  I think Americans are prone to panic because we are somewhat isolated from the world by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  We share the longest undefended border in the world with Canada and are on good terms with Mexico.  This gives us an unusual sense of security, and whenever that security is threatened we tend to overreact to it.  We are so grateful for what we have we don’t want anything to take it from us.  Since the acts of 9/11/01 we have become increasingly suspicious of anything and anyone that might harm us again.  We also go to almost ridiculous lengths to protect ourselves.  In the 1950’s it was backyard bomb shelters and last month it was the duct tape and plastic wrap.  If you look at areas of the world who deal with insecurity on a daily basis (like Israel) you will see that they are much more prepared because threats to their security occur on a daily basis.

===subject:its the media's fault
===message:I am going to have to jump on the bandwagon and blame the media for the easiness of Americans to be so fooled into paranoia.  Actually, I would have to explain that the media gives us images of death and destruction and Hollywood gives us the movies that support these ideas and we watch them.  So, indirectly, Americans are at fault for their own paranoia.  Gossip has always been such a detrimental thing.  I believe that individuals are capable of making rash decisions but people, as a collective are very prone to panic.  I am glad that the Government gives us the ideas of taping our windows and other such things but if only there was a way to pass on the information without everyone freaking out.  We all have such a mistrust of our neighbor that we will take the smallest evidence of anything amiss and jump to conclusions.  Once again I think that the media capitalizes on this with such movies as Conspiracy Theory, and Enemy of the State.

===message:When people fail to educate themselves, they rely on leadership to think for them instead. And leaders can control the masses fairly easily with superstition. Duct tape and plastic sheeting? A classic illustration. Many Americans didn't stop to ask some very simple questions about that little idea. These items do come in handy in a concrete apartment in Israel if you do not have the money to install a professional safe room. And it is used in biological/viral hot zones to repair biological space suits. But the average American could not easily seal every crack in their home with these materials. The leaders in the 50's were master manipulators of mass hysteria in our nation. The atomic bomb blew our collective mind, and we collectively went insane for a while, much like we are in danger of doing now, I think. 9/11 changed me as an individual of course, and shook my sense of safety to the core. And I have made changes. I no longer allow my son to fly alone. I have yet to see acceptable lasting change in security measures for air passengers. It may or may not be the right thing, but it's a decision I make for myself and for him, reviewing information I carefully gather. I did not buy plastic and duct tape. I have wood floors and a crawl space under my house, it wouldn't seal it. And statistically, I'm unlikely to be affected by such an attack. Emergency stash? I've maintained a system for that since I went through Hurricane Andrew. I didn't need my government to help me make any of these decisions. I have a strong inherent distrust of any government who employs tactics of mass hysteria, rather than encouraging people to think for themselves. I'll mandate my own reality, thanks, and I hope I won't get arrested for it someday. I'm not famous enough yet to be blacklisted.

===message:The causes of anticommunism hysteria that swept that nation during the 1940’s and 1950’s was the Cold War evolving, the Red Scare of World War II, the establishment of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The reason why McCarthyism received so much support is because he informed his fellow Republicans that the Democrats were being too easy on the communists. When he filed a suit against several women he thought were communists after attending a GOP meeting West Virginia, his effort to prove that communism existed in the GOP, gained support of many Americans. Americans are so prone to panic because we live in a country where our government is unjust and dishonest and a time where the possibility of any type of threat on our soil is unimagined and unrealized. The Civil War and the Pearl Harbor attacks are the last major incidents on our soil the effects of both have been long forgotten by the average American. Americans are so prone to panic because of the guilt that many like to hide but carry it inside.  Many I know feel that 9/11 happened because of some covert attempt or success by the US in a foreighn country. This is why such panic arose when the September 11th attacks happened.  Many Americans feel that we are getting paid back for the attrocities we have dished out or allowed to happen over time. The government is probably the most active propoganda machine every created.  Because of our so called humanitarian concerns we cloak our real reasons for what we do or why we do. When the government informed the public of the possible threat of biological weapons from terrorists and made suggestions to prevent infection, Americans bought massive quantities of duct tape and plastic sheeting.  Now seriously do you really think this will protect you from Biological weapons! :)

===message:The causes of the hysteria were the Cold War, the Red Scare and the investigations of the HUAC.  America was so afraid of the communists taking over, and they were paranoid that communists were among them.  McCarthyism was so popular because Joe McCarthy revealed to America how the democrats were "soft on communism."  America wanted someone who would stand against communism which is what made him so popular.  I think Americans are so prone to panic because of the fear that the media puts into their minds.  Since September 11th, everyone is afraid of another attack and now of nuclear warfare.  The media is suggesting people to go out and buy duct tape and plastic sheeting to help protect against nuclear warfare, which has many people in a panic.
