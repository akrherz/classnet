===message:In the seventies people made a change in their political views to express their concerns over issues involving the environment. They wanted the government to at knowledge that there was a problem and question them on what they plan to do about it. There main concerns were over wildlife and nuclear power. These concerns started to change during the Regan era. The individuals that once thought about the environment and other peoples health, now thought about only themselves. Their goals were to get their bodies in shape, and to buy as much real estate as possible. These solutions are always temporary when you try to forget them by endorsing some other extreme solution. We are far better off today than are parents were, because we have experienced tremendous growth and more equality for are fellow man and woman. It would be crazy of us to think that one man caused some of the problems that we have in today society. I think that ever President has contributed some good and bad things to our present day situations. One thing is for sure it is always easier to make judgments sitting on the sidelines, but once you’re in the game it is a whole different story. The question that we have to ask our self is could we make such decisions and have the American public question are every move about it. I could not.

===message:The problems facing the nation in the 1970's were due to a number of disappointments the people felt at the hands of our government.  Although each of these presidents did provide great successes and improvements in some areas, overall they left Americans feeling unsatisfied and in some cases betrayed.  Kennedy, though a good man, promised much but accomplished little.  Although he possessed a "potential for greatness" and was admired by many, his popularity was not at it's greatest until he was assassinated.  Upon this tragic event, Americans sought comfort and were greeted with Lyndon B. Johnson.  Unfortunately, LBJ never measured up to Kennedy's "potential for greatness" and was therefore seen as a disappointment.  Although he never produced a tragedy or scandal, people just did not like him.  (Similar to how a child would feel towards a new step-parent replacing a deceased parent.)  These two presidents in the 60's left the nation feeling vunerable and eager for a change.  So, in 1969, when Nixon entered office, the people looked to him for that missing link.  Unfortunately, his personal agenda turned into scandal and deceit and completely crushed the people's trust in our government.  At this point, the nation was angry, hurt and had lacked any confidence at all in our leaders.  The transitional president, Gerald Ford, did little for the presidency other than to bring someone into office who had no agenda to deceive the nation.  He accomplished little, but also disappointed little.  Simply, Ford was someone to call Mr. President for four years.  The late 70's and early 80's were improved upon by some measure beginning primarily with Jimmy Carter.  Although Carter was not a political genius by any means, he was warm and comforting in his appearance and approach.  In a way, he too was a transitional president, from Ford's blandness to Reagan's goodness.  Reagan's agenda including restoring U.S. leadership and pride and for many was a welcome change.  I think the problems facing the nation that seemed insoluble during the 70's were temporary.  Although for a while the people lost confidence in our government, overall most people feel that we are lucky to live in this country.  Of course, there are times we do not like what our government may say or do, but for the majority of the time, we are taken care of and most of the problems of the 60's, 70's and 80's have changed in some way or another.  I do believe we are better off as a whole today than 20 years ago.  With the advancements in medicine, technology and environmental issues, we have become a better country.  There is always improvements to be done, such as racial issues, sexist issues and the like, but nothing can be changed overnight.  These things take time and we are slowly but surely continuously progressing.  I think all problems we face are legacies of not only Reagan years, but of all past president's years in some way.  At the end of each president's term, the problems of that time do not simply vanish.  Each new term brings new problems and has to deal with old problems.

===message:I think one of the largest problems of the 1970s was the diminishing confidence in the government by the American people and I don’t think this problem will ever be totally solved.  However, with the Reagan administration in the 80s, the American people began to feel better about the government with his reduced taxes and deregulation but the lack of confidence still lingered and the problems he faced, such as the Iran-contra affair, although never proven to be a part of it, did not help matters.  I do think we are better off today than twenty years ago, mostly because of the civil rights movements!  We are still struggling for equality, although not near as much as the 70s; but there are still tragic downfalls in this struggle such as the sad increased prejudice towards people of Middle Eastern decent after September 11th. I would venture to say that a large problem stemming from the Reagan years would be poverty.  It is clearly stated that the Reagan administration turned their heads away from the issues of poverty, I wonder if that administration had paid attention to the problems of the “inner cities” would it still be as big of a problem now?

===message:During the 70's the country was still searching for someone to turn to that they could trust, confide and believe in.  Much like a substitute teacher, the presidents previous to Reagan were just "there" to watch the "kids" and go throught the daily routine.  It is fortunate that Jimmy Carter was president previous to Reagan because Carter was a bridge in that he did not do a lot politically, was not wise economically but held a deep seeded southern charm that helped people believe that he was honest, caring, and most importantly trying.  I dont think that there is such a thing as a permanent solution involving politics.  Americans are better off today but not because of the presidents and it also depends on how you define "better off".  I believe we have traded some of our liberties for luxuries.  I dont believe that there were any direct backdrafts from the Reagan administration with the exception of the Iran contra.

===message:<p>The problems in the late '70s were complex. The national economy was in a downturn, but it was exaserbated by the oil embargo. This led to serious inflation, which is usualy the byproduct of a robust economy. Inflation basicaly decreases the value of currency, thus driving the cost of goods and services higher. Businesses combat this by cutting costs, the easiest method being lowering wages and shrinking the workforce. This leads to what was reffered to in the readings as "stagflation". Business stagnates, increasing unemployment while inflation makes poverty more acute.</p>
<p>I think the reason that these problems seemed insurmountable is that Americans are in the habit of looking toward the government for economic fixes. There wasn't a real fix in sight. The truth is that economic cycles are going to happen in free market capitalism, whether the government intervenes or not.</p>
<p>Reagan's approach was giant step away from the New Deal legacy as far as domestic fiscal policy. He relaxed restrictions on business in the form of tax breaks and lessened regulation. The effectively lowered the cost of operation and, coupled with a decrease in energy costs, opened the door for business expansion. Expansion of business always leads to employee benifits, which leads to increased consumerism, which in turn leads to increased profits for business. I think the policy was effective and the reading's assumptions that this was the primary cause for the subsequant recession of the early 90's is not supported by real facts and ecconomic understanding.</p>
<p>The "irrational exuberance" experienced in the mid 80's was the direct cause of the recession. The ecconomy hadn't grown enough to justify the actions of investors. Similar to the turn of the milenium downturn we're still in, eventualy the real market catches up with speculation and a recession begins.</p>
<p>Are we better off than we were 20 years ago? I would say yes... and no. Our overall quality of life has probably increased, but from a statistical viewpoint there is less wealth per capita than there was 20 years ago. After you adjust for inflation the growth in actual GNP broken down per capita is a fraction of what this country saw in the post WWII boom. Yet speculators rave about a "new economy" and unheard of growth. Statistics are easily misrepresented to people who don't fully understand them. I don't claim to be an expert in the farthest stretch of the word, but I have done quite a bit of reading into this and I think we're in for some tough economic lessens in the next 10 years or so. The economy is still way overvalued when you look at the GNP per capita and corperate earnings and debt. When you combine that with the record debt to income ration of the average household we are still acting like we're in a booming economy when we haven't been for 30 years.</p>

===message:America seemed to turn inward during the years from President Ford to President Reagan because they seemed to realize that they had many problems on the home front, not just in the world after the Vietnam War. There was rampant poverty, inflation (stagflation, as the book said), rising gas prices, rising bank interest rates so home purchases were falling, and health-care problems. Even though we did have problems overseas, our came to the forefront. Reagan was elected to cure "stagflation"; Americans believed that self-help and private enterprise were the cure for America's woes. Religion came to the forefront during this time, as Americans turned toward it and traditional values again. Televangelist became much more popular (and then tanked later on). Reagan offered diminished government intervention, reduced taxes and spending, and unleashed the free-enterprise system. Reagan's system seemed to be what the country needed to repair itself. Social activism changed to more of an environmentalism stand as we realized that we were ruining this country with pollution and other environmentally unfriendly acts. People bought VCRs and TV as technology improved, and they stayed home and watched movies as a family instead of going out. The easing of Cold War tension left Americans more time to worry about the American way of life instead of just keeping alive. The problems seemed insoluble because their seemed to be no way out of the rising inflation, gas prices, bank interest, and things like that. Reagan plan's helped America see that it could be at least partially solved (although gas prices were still high). His tax cuts increased spending so the inflationary rate started stabilizing and interest rates started dropping. Reagan seemed to be the solution to the problems! We seemed to get a grip on ourselves as a people so we could work out other problems worldwide. I believe that all solutions are temporary depending on who is in office because every President has a different issue that needs to be brought to the forefront sometimes changing present solutions to do so. I do feel that we are better off now than 20 years ago even though some of the same things go on today but in a different way we as a people/nation/country have come a long way and made about 99.5 % of the way but we still have a long way to go before we say that we are finish running this race and make it because 99.5% just want do we have to make it 100%.

Granted he inherited the high inflation and other economics situations but he only tried to remedy them for the rich and upper class.  The average poor folks continued to suffer.  The overwhelming problems seemed insoluable because the people were lacking trust in their government.  The solutions that Reagan proposed were far fetched, the tax cuts and so on, but given time they did work-but only for the upper class.  The solution was temporary, thank goodness, but the future government of Bill Clinton would give the nation back to a presidency that cared for the little people.  No, Americans are not better off now than were were 20 years ago because we are once again living under a government that worshipped Reagan.

===message:Relay is one way to describe the economic problems that lurked the 1970’s and 80’s. Each president during this period was faced with unemployment, inflation and skyrocketing energy prices. Nixon, plan was to impose wage-price controls, but they did little good. Ford, in 1974 imposed measure to curb inflation, which led to a 12-percent unemployment, and the most serious recession since the Great Depression. A tax cut, coupled with higher unemployment benefits, led to modest recovery, but still no end to economic difficulties.  Carter, in 1976 at first permitted a policy of deficit spending. When the Federal Reserve Board increased the money supply to cover deficits, inflation rose to 10 percent a year. Carter responded by cutting the budget to slow inflation, but cuts affected social programs at the heart of Democratic policy. By the end of his term, with deficits still high, the alienation of the business community could be seen in falling bond prices and rising interest rates. Solutions were found during the Reagan years (1980). Reagan’s 1980 domestic program was rooted in his belief that the nation would prosper if the power of the private economic sector were unleashed. Reagan south large tax cuts to promote greater consumer spending, saving and investment, increased earning and—through taxes on these earning—increased government revenues. Steadfast to his commitment of no new taxes, Reagan signed a federal tax-reform measure. This measure, lowered income tax rates, simplified tax brackets and closed loopholes, taking an important step toward taxing low-income Americans more equitably.  These programs led to a substantial improvement in economic conditions. Unfortunately, the chronically poor did not benefit. Many poor and middle-class families actually lost ground, as low and semi-skilled jobs were eliminated from the economy. Federal Deficit spending will always be a problem, and until it is curved and maintained, it will continue to appear insoluble.  

We are no better off today, as we were 20 years ago. Today, unemployment rate is at an all time high. Companies are downsizing, merging, and laying off workers. Assisted Programs for the needed have been cut.  Homelessness is still on the rise. 

Past, Present, and Future President will be faced with economical issues. Whereas one program may help one issue, another issue would probably go without. The Bottom line is,  “In order to pay Peter, you have to take from Paul.  No, I don’t think that the problems we're facing are because of the Reagan years.

===message:The U.S. was forced to turn inward as the distractions of foriegn issues lessoned, and domestic issues rose.  The problem's of the 1970's seemed unsoluble due to the inability of the administration to develop clear plans to address them.  Although well intentioned, Carter and Reagan were unable to deal with domestic issues in an effective manner.  Foreign concerns seemed easier to pinpoint and try to solve.  Possibly the numberous variables involved in domestic issues kept these President's from being able to improve the economy, welfare system, and health care system.  I feel that Carter was definitely concerned about these issues, but based on his "outsider" persona and lack of political savvy, could not get anyone including Congress to believe in and back him.  Reagan was not really concerned about these issues in my opinion.  Reagan appealed to the New Right in his moral and social ideals, but he really didn't have clear plans to make changes.  Carter and Reagan both made it into office based on American's need for change from the previous Administration.  Carter was not seen as strong enough to bring the U.S. out of crisis, and Reagan, although charismatic, did what he wanted without really centering on the needs of the people.  Power was his objective and getting what he wanted "by any means necessary".  During the 1080's, Reagan proposed massive spending cuts(Reaganomics) in order to improve American capitalism.  This plan was only temporary because it did not focus on the long running implications for the future.  Americans also focused more on themselves during the 1970's.  The "me generation" wanted economic change for the middle and upper class and no longer focused on the issues of the elderly and poor.  By Reagan's second term there existed high military spending, weakened Cold War relations, massive budget deficits, cuts in social programs, a large foreign-trade gap, and a dent in ghe government's regulatory function.  Americans unfortunately was dazzled by Reagans acting abilities and the fact that he told Americans what they wanted to hear.  Americans are better off than 20 years ago, but we are again going through a cycle of War, cuts in social programs, and high unemployment that could threaten to put us back into that recessive state.  The present problems in the U.S. in my opinion do not have a clear correlation to legacies of the Reagan years.  I feel that the U.S. had started to recover from Reganomics and were on a steady road until 9/11 and the current War in the Middle East.  The economy has been going haywire for the last three years and with all of the large companies going into bankrupcy, and massive layoffs, it is uncertain of the role that any reminants of the Reagan era could have on these current issues.

===message:It would seem that each President faced the same problems throughout the mid 70's to the early 90's.  These problems included inflation, a bad economy, and huge budget and trade deficits.  Each President promised to resolve these problems but in the end only bequeathed them to his successor.  During the Reagan administration of the 1980's, the economy problems seemed to have been dealt away with.  However, Bush had to feel the backlash of this as he had to take care of the problmes that Reagonomics created.  When Reagan cut taxes and boosted spending, people looked the other way because inflation dropped to 4 percent and the economy rebounded.  Bush tried to deal with the problems but realized that he would have to go against his campaign promise and raise taxes.  his administration suffered for the mistakes of the previous.  I feel that Americans are better off today than before.  Not as much money is being funneled into defense spending and we can concentrate on the inner problems a little more.  This idea seems to be changing though.  I believe that we may be suffering still from the Reagan years due to the huge defecit the country has.  In the past few years we have heard about budget surplusses and this may mean that the government is moving the right direction.

Maybe solutions were not really found in the 1980s, maybe peoples’ attitudes just changed.  I think Americans are always better off today than yesterday.

Another problem was the economic situation of the nation.  Many of the ways that solutions were found for these problems during the 1980s was through good diplomatic relations.  Through good diplomatic relations, the Cold War ended, China began to look like a friend, and the economy looked as if it would start to get better.  The Cold War and relations with China were for the most part permanent, at least we are not in conflict with China and the Cold War is no longer a part of day-to-day life.  The economy was temporary; at least the optimistic outlook on the economy was temporary.  The economy during the 1980s and into the 1990s was far from what many Americans wanted.  Americans are better off than they were twenty years ago.  Even though the economy is down, the unemployment rate and deficit are not at the levels that they were in the Eighties and Nineties.  Furthermore, many social programs have fought unemployment and poverty.  And environmental concerns are being addressed, though not as fast as they should be.

===message:The recession, mounting economic problems, and environmental issues of the 1970s seemed insoluble.  Jimmy Carter attempted to fight the recession with a tax cut and public-works program but this was not a long-term solution.  Carter, due to his poor relations with Congress, was unable to enact a health-care reform or overhaul of the welfare system.  Inflation was a major concern that extended to Ronald Reagan.  Reagan's economic program ("Reagonomics") included deregulation, spending reductions in several programs, and tax cuts.  But Reagonomics also led to another serious problem - federal deficit.  In the early 1980s the economy rebounded and it seemed that inflation was finally under control.  This gave way to what the writer Tom Wolfe called the "Me Generation."  People began to be more concerned with themselves than with the public good.  The solutions were all temporary.  As soon as one President thought he had a handle on some issues, others were created.  I think in some aspects we are better off than we were 20 years ago (quality of life, technology gains) but we still continue to face the same issues - economy issues, social issues, and poverty.

With the increase of oil prices, interest rates, and inflation all made Reagan’s plans backfire.  Reagan had a solution that only was temporary.  In the long run, things ended up having an adverse affect.  George Bush referred to “Reagonomics” as “Voodoo Economics”.  This pretty much meant that the rich people didn’t have to worry, and the lower tax bracket people ended up getting screwed.  Reagan’s tactics ultimately ended up causing a class system in America.  20 to 30 years ago was not better than what we have here today.  Technology in the 90’s gave many people the chance to make lots of money.  If they were smart they could have kept their money when the market in the .com era crashed.  20 to 30 years ago, people didn’t have the option to expand their wealth like this.

Few changes were made by the Reagan administration on focusing attention on the poor and the minorities, while it seemed that the "yuppies" got richer, and the love and yearn for money became an obsession.  I think American's may be better off today material wise, but not as far as being happy with life.

===message:The Reagan years for me are the fall of the Berlin wall, the Iran-Contra scandal, corporate greed and corruption, a return to patriarchy, a return to discrimination, and turning away from the needs of the poorest among us. Most of all, the Reagan years are when I started burying my best friends who were dying of a mysterious virus, while the Reagan administration denied funding to the CDC for the acquisition of an electron microscope, which could have helped them to isolate the AIDS virus that burns through Africa today. We would be better equipped to face the weapons of mass destruction which threaten us today if our government had realized that what effects the least among us eventually touches us all. I know that I should probably be writing about the federal deficit, foreign policy and military build-up. But when I think of Reagan, I see the bodies of my friends that I had planned to grow old with, and the wealth that we all lost when they died far too soon. My son's love of music, art and celebration of life come from souls who now rest in the ground. Reagan was the first president to deny funding to contain a virus. We must now quickly learn much about those elusive life forms if we are to survive in today's world of genetic engineering and terrorism. His Star Wars plan won't protect us from our greatest threat, but the scientists who waged the war he refused might get enough funding returned to help us in time, as long as smallpox doesn't kill homosexuals first. Better off? Too soon to tell, but it's looking fairly bleak.

===message:During the 1970s there was a period when unemployment, crimes, and economic crisis was high. Regan did tax cuts to balance out these mishaps that were overcoming the American people. But, instead the situation grew worse and it seem like the economy was not picking up. By the 1980s the inflation was brought under control and the economy was getting better. There was social issues ignored and the focus was on the weak economy. The solutions were temporary. In today society it’s hard to say because we are going through war and the economy is not doing well. The unemployment, crime, and poverty rates are high. To a certain extent I think we are doing a little better in trying to overcome these difficult times. We are still facing tax, poverty, crime, and unemployment.

===message:The nation during the 70's was rebounding from a number of scandals inside the federal government and from bad decisions made by past presidents.  Not to mention the latter stages of the cold war.  President Reagan dealt with the cold war with an iron fist he also tried to catapult the economy by putting money back into the hands of the people.  Without question we are better off than we were 20 years ago.  Look at all of the technological advances we have achieved.  Look at how the united states is the only super power still going strong.  Not to mention the opportunity many of us have as americans.

===message:After all those years of worrying about the rest of the world we as a nation were ready to improve thins and do a little house cleaning at home. The spending programs to boost the economy along with a renewed drive to succeed seemed to push us forward as a nation. At least for my family this change was permanent. With out a doubt we are better off know than 20 –30 years ago. I think most of the problems that we face today internally are more a result of lax morals and parenting than of Reagan. No one wants to take personal responsibility any more.

===message:Many problems in the late 1970s seemed insolvable because it seemed that nothing that the government did was effective at correcting them.  Stagflation had the economy bogged down and there appeared to be no hope in sight.  Solutions were found in the early 1980s through Reganomics.  This gave the people hope and began the turn around that helped solve many of the problems of the 1970s.  Many of the solutions were temporary and had their own inherent problems that were discovered over time.  I believe that even with the problems in the U.S. today that we are much better off then we were 20 years ago.  Many of today’s problems can be linked back to the Regan years, but with such a large economy, it takes a while for things to work or not work and then be fixed.

===message:The one thing that Reagan accomplished that no other President before him accomplished was that he gained military power without going to physical war.  During the start of the Reagan administration he had a great burden of existing Soviet military power.  Knowing that annihilation of the U.S. could be completed through nuclear missles at any point in time, Reagan increased military expenditures.  That's why we do not fear complete nuclear destruction today.  Because of the Reagan adminstration, the Cold War is not existing today.

===message:There were so many loose ends for the Reagan Administration to deal with.  Many unresolved issues that were left from the past Presidency now face President Reagan.  As one issue was resolved, others raise their "ugly head."  Reaganomics help to resolve many issues and gave the American people a sense of possibilities.  I think we are better off because, through the possess of time, many issues have been resolved and America has risen victorious.

===message:The problems during this time seemed insoluble because it was taking such a long time for them to get better.  It looked as if everthing Reagan was trying to do to help the people just made things worse, like the tax cuts for example.  The economy started to pick up from the depression, in the 1980s.  I guess by the way things were back then there wasn't much anyone could do to make the economy suffer much more, all that could happen was for it to get better.  The solutions taken back then were temporary, because although our ecomony had gotten better, after all of those problems, now things have become rocky, and our economy hasn't really been doing so well lately.  So I really don't think we are that much better off than we ere 20 years ago.  I don't think our present problems can be blamed on just the Reagan years, because there have been other people who have contributed to them also.

===message:During the 1970's we were facing inflation that was skyrocketing and the unemployment rate was at an all time high (sounds a lot like now doesn't it?).  There appeared to be no help in sight.  The solutions found during the 1980 seemed to work however time has shown that they're not permanent solutions.  I'm not sure that a permanent solution to the recurring problems of inflation and unemployment exists.  The problems we face today are not legacies of the Reagan years however some of the symptoms certainly are.  The cuts in Federal programs for instance are one of the symptoms that helped exacerbate the problems of today.  Also the tax cuts that provided benefits to the minority (read here "RICH") but created a bigger budget deficit.  We're no worse off today than we were 20 years ago.  Our symptoms are different but the problems remain the same.

===message:The problems of RR's terms in office seemed insoluble because we were so busy in covert ops in Third World countries to address the ongoing economy struggles.  I know that many of the actions of one administration are often felt by the next but with leadership qualities and knowledge of business skills it seems that many issues can be addressed.  Although I hate to disrespect a man in such a mental state as that of RR at the present, I think acting was a career more suited for him than that of president.  Do I think that we are better off than 20 years ago?  Yes, technology makes so many things possible for us now.  Although Bush II may be set in his ways and a "cowboy" I think that his strong stance on many issues is to clean up what RR left behind.  Thank you, cowboy.
