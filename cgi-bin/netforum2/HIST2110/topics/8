===more:What were the points of contention between the United States and Japan in the 1930s and early 1940s? To what extent did the contention result from different views of each other, and to what extent was there a real threat? What were the steps that brought the two nations into armed conflict? Could armed conflict have been avoided? Is war ever avoidable? Even now?
