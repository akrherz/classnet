Most of these are just a gut feeling for some reason I would feel worse when hitting and killing a larger animal then a smaller on. Hitting and killing a person would be the worst.

I think that I would probably be affected no matter what animal it is that I hit.  I rated the animals in a way that the more common animals like bullfogs and chickens didn't have as much of an affect on me.  I thought that the human were kind of in their own category and I let my personal feelings play in to those decisions.

   This is a very difficult task, trying to rate the value of these species lives.  I would like to say that the only basis of my ratings was from the value of each species according to the numbers of them present.  It is true that I think it is important to preserve a species that is facing extinction, however there is an even larger factor in my descion.  For some reason the size of the animal very much determines how bad I would feel about hitting it.  The very large species seem to be closer to my awareness and it directly relates to the pain that I would feel for them.  Even a large animal like a deer I would feel very bad for hitting, although it is not endangered and probably less intelligent than a red-tailed hawk.  Hitting a person would be the most tramatic.  Although, I would rather run over someone like Adolf Hitler than most other humans, in either case their pain is very close to something I can understand so I would feel horrible.  The larger animals like the wolf or the chimp I would also feel bad for because they are large and few in number.  I have dogs that are very important to me, so this species would also make me feel very bad.  The smaller butterfly and the bullfrog, despite any issues of abundance, I would not feel bad for hitting.  They just seem so small and unimportant, though I would like to say I would care about hitting them, I probably would not.  The turtle and the chicken are middle sized and I would feel somewhat guilty for running over them, issues of endangerment would not come into play here.

I would feel worst about killing a human because they are "one of us" and I can relate to them easier than anything else.  Who the person is or what they have done good or bad would not change the way I feel about killing a individual.  Dogs rank high in devistation also because of the relationships I have had with my dogs and I know how bad someone else would feel if I killed there dog.  More commonly killed species such as butterflies and bullfrogs don't have a big effect because running over them in a truck is excepted as a normal occurance.

Birds, butterflies, and even to some extent turtles are things that are more common.  I feel bad for the deer, but I figure if it wasn't running out in front of my car, none of this would have happened.  I would hate to kill a dog, because I see it as a pet.  And wolves seem to much like a dog for me.  Besides, maybe if I hadn't killed the wolf, he could have gotten that stupid deer before it hit my car!

I would obviously feel the worst about hitting a person.  At the risk of sounding heartless, since we are assuming the person died, I would also be really worried about getting charged with something like invluntary manslaughter.  That's a risk you don't have to worry about if you kill a butterfly.  <BR>
I adore dogs, so if I hit one I would be very upset.  As for the deer, I have hit one before.  And I was upset.  I mean, when you see a dead deer on the side of the road it's like, "Oh, look.  Its a dead deer."  But hitting one os a different story, and watching it die is a different story.  I imagine that the same would be true for a chimp, wolf, and the hawk.  I don't think the hawk would affect me as much as the chimp and deer, but I would be unhappy about it. <BR>
I would feel sort of bad about hitting the bullfrog, chicken, turtle, and Hitler.  They are living things, but it's just not something I would lose any sleep over. I would prefer it didn't happen, but if it did, well, better a chicken than a person.
I don't notice what bugs smack into my windsheild, unless they're lightening bugs that leave the yellow glowing stuff on them, so I don't think I'd care much about the butterfly either.  HOwever, assuming I knew that it was hit and was endangered, I'd feel a LITTLE bad, so I gave it a ranking of 8.

I think the two factors which most determined how upset I would be if I had killed any of the above would be the size of the animal and how personally close I might feel to it.  I would definitely feel the worst about killing a person simply because as humans we tend to value our own species above all others and I would relate more with a person that I might kill than with, for example, a butterfly.  While I love all animals, the smaller the animal was, the greater chance I would have of accepting what I had done and getting on with my life.  I think the size factor may also play into how much guilt I would have because a smaller animal might be harder to see or miss if it just darts out in front of your car but I feel like I might have a better chance of seeing and missing a larger animal, and thus if I killed one I would feel more guilty.  After humans, I consider chimpanzees most closely related to us and would thus give them a rating of four.  Our society also tends to value dogs as pets and deer as beautiful animals and a source of food, and this may be why I gave each of these a score of five.  I also feel a little more humanly connected with wolves and turtles than some of the other, smaller animals.

Mostly gut reactions.  I would be devastated  even if I hit Adolf Hitler because 1) he is human, 2)some of the historical accounts I have read indicate that he was mentally ill and in American we don't execute insane people, and, 3) although it was his idea, he didn't murder 5 million people all by himself.   

I'm sure someone loved him in his lifetime, even Hitler had a mother.

Basically I would feel pretty devastated about hitting most things.  Obviously things like insects are unavoidable, so I don't usually feel bad when I hit a fly, but anything larger (except cockroaches) I would feel very upset about killing.  I don't even like killing spiders in the bathroom.  With a chicken, turtle, or a bullfrog I think I would get over it sooner.  With the butterfly, I think once I realized it was endangered I would feel upset about its death.  I don't think the Hitler question is quite fair because on the one hand I don't think we have the right to kill even complete bastards but on the other hand I would probably enjoy running him over, if it was unavoidable.

Most of the things on the list wouldn't make me feel too bad.  Yeah, I probably would be a little bit upset at the time, but I would get over it.  For example this morning I hit a rabbit.  I felt bad for about five minutes, but hey, it's just a rabbit.  On the other hand if I hit a person I would be devastated.  That person is someone's son, brother, friend, the same thing goes with a dog, except its just someones friend.
