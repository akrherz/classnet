===message:My opinion of zoos differs based on what kind of a zoo it is.  There are some zoos that are very nice and have a lot of habitat for the animals to live.  These types of zoos do not exploit the animals, but rather us them to teach the public about different types of wild animals and their habitat.  I think that zoos should educate people about how we need to save endangered or threatened animals and how we need to restore their habitats.  They should be a learning experience not just a place for people to look at animals.  I do not like zoos that do not treat the animals right and do not have the correct habitat for them to live.  I also don't like places like Sea World where they degrade the animals by having them perform tricks for the audiences and I don't think that animals should be caught specifically to have them perform tricks.  I feel sad when I look at these animals but I am glad to know that in places like Sea World they are not treated poorly.  I also don't like animals being used in some circus acts.  We don't know how the animals are actually being treated behind the scenes.  I like the idea of only having rescued animals that would not be able to take care of themselves in the wild in the zoos.  We are not totally taking the animals away from their original habitat this way.  In general I like going to zoos, but I have been to zoos where I have come away feeling very bad for the animals because of the way that they are being treated.

===message:     I believe that zoos are a very valuable place of reserve for many animals.  I think that it is great that they can be utilized to make sure species we have almost destroyed are cable of surviving.  On the other hand, we should not count on zoos to be a place to take animals whose habitats we have destroyed.  It would be much better to preserve them naturally first and then take them to an environment like a zoo for people to enjoy.  I believe that in today's modern zoo envirnments the animals are treated very well and it is not an inhumane condition.  People are much more likely to consider the importance of nature conservation when they view the beautiful animals at a zoo.  I think that there should be reminders placed around the zoo to tell people of the species facing extinction and people will be more likely to give contributions.
<BR>
     Animals at the ocean theme parks are morally questionable in my mind.  I have never worked with an animal like a dolphin or a killer whale to know if they enjoy performing for humans.  I think any forceful method to teach and command an animal to do tricks is wrong.  These places are also a great way to create public awareness as to the extinction possibities for many animals.  I am not so sure that it is ok for people, only wanting money benefits, to remove these animals from their natural homes.  If they want to educate people and preserve the species it seems to be reasonable to do so.
<BR>
     I am somewhat bothered by the animal acts at the zoo.  I known there are situations here where the animals are being forced, often with physical threats, to perform.  I do not think that this helps create public awarenesss of species loss, but degrades their opinions of the animals.  I don't think that it provides proper respect for nature.

The zoos can be used to educate people as well. <BR>
While some people believe that zoos are man's attempt to capture and control nature, I tend to disagree.  Most zoos have some sort of mission, usually dealing with educating the public.  Some zoos are also an outreach for helping save various species from extinction.

===message:Zoos are valuable as way of preserving some species from extiction as well as their educational value and promote sympathy for ecology by showing people some of the animals we need to try to protect, making them more likely to help with conservation efforts.  I think zoos are an aid to nature (helping to preserve endangered species) not merely a domination of nature.  Many animals live a better life in a zoo than they would in the wild.  They do not have to compete for food or worry about predators.  I am not sad when I see animals in a zoo I enjoy seeing the wonders of creation.  It is much like the laws of our country, while one can make a case that we are not free to drive as fast as we wish, or own some types of weapons, we would not really want total freedom in some areas because of the dangers involved.  <BR>
I don't have a problem with animals performing tricks.  They are simply being taught to use the minds and bodies in new ways much as we are in the educational system.  Catching animals for display is a worthy cause because these animals help to bring attention to the plight of their kind, and removes them from natural dangers.  Circuses also can be positive for animals as long as the animals are treated well and cared for properly.

If it wasn't for zoos some species might of become extint but because the zoo provided a envirnoment for it to servive numbers of different species have been able to multiple until levels are high enough to begin letting them out into nature again.  I feel sorry for the animals a little bit but I think zoos do an excellent job of creating a natural habitat for the animals and keep good care of them.  The idea of making animals do tricks for our entertainment I do not feel is degrading or wrong for the animals as long as the teaching practices are appropriate.  Going out seaching for animals for this specific purpose I think is okay because the animal will probably recieve a better life being kept care of by humans than it would out in the harsh realities of nature.

===message:  I believe that land animals are definitely adversely affected by being kept in small cages in Zoo's.  Their life style is totally interrupted and I believe this shows in their social behavior, or lack of it, and their poor ability to reproduce in captivity.  I do belive that people understand more about these animals if they see them live.  These animals are definitely used for entertainment though. More Safari type of Zoo's would benefit the animals tremendously.  
  Ocean type Sea Mammals are able to adapt to humans better and seem to accept human contact more than land animals.  Circus animals are treated the worst of all animals in captivity in my eyes.  This mainly comes from the fact that they are constantly being shipped all over the world without having time to become adjusted to their new surroundings.  This is totally for entertainment and does not benefit the animals at all. 
  I do like to see the animals as much as anyone, but believe with the amount of money that some countries have, the animals in captivity could have a better home life.

I feel that if an animal is going to be kept for other to watch and learn from then it shoul be in a comfortable environment. Not in a small cage, with limited roaming abilities. The animals are stressed. They can not follow their natural instincts of "flight". They must stay and "face their fears". I feel that it is somewhat degrading even though animals have no emotions as we define the word. I fear captivity for any animal. I feel that zoos do encourage funding in one way shape or form, but I feel that the "ZOO" could be better structured and more animal friendly.

===message:   For the most part, I believe that zoos have started to shift their focus from entertainment to education and conservation.  Of course a lot of the level of conservation has to do with the amount of funding.  I'm not so naive to think that Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines gets the same amount of dollars as the National Zoo or the San Diego Zoo.  I remember going to the zoo simply for the joy of seeing the animals.  Heck, I still have fun going to the zoo to see the animals, and now that my son is old enough, he loves it too.  The differences I see today are things like the programs that the zoos have to tell you about a specific animal,  zoo day camps, etc... <BR>
   I'd like to believe that most animals who are put into zoos were saved from a certain death type situation.  But even so, I feel bad for some of them because I don't feel as though some of the animals get a fair shake once they get into zoos.  Some of the bigger zoos have fantastic habitats modeled very closely to the animal's native habitat.  Then there's the drive-in, roadside zoo, that has a bunch of animals that are cramped into small areas with little or no shade and/or protection.  It's hard to say that maybe death out on the savanna wouldn't have been more merciful.<BR>
   I think that Sea World and other marine parks operate in much the same way.  Even if the animals are trained to tricks for a crowd, that money can be spent for further research.  Marine parks might well be one of the reasons people have shifted their thinkng about whales from horrible, man-eating creatures to believing that they are almost sentient.<BR>
   Circuses on the other hand do not do much research into the health and preservation of their animal's species and habitats. Yet, they are still a popular form of entertainment.  I wonder if we took the humans (clowns, acrobats, human cannonball, whatever) out of the circus, whether there would be much intrest left in the circus.

are fed and groomed properly.  The animals are not being

excited about seeing all the different types of animals and

zoo.  Captive mammals at places like Sea World are also 
taken care of and I love going to those places to see all 
the mammals.  I do not think that it is degrading for the 
animals to do tricks for us.  The animals seem to enjoy it 
and they are taken care of.  I think that killer whales that

Just traveling to the airport would equal that!  THey also allow people to see exactly what a species looks like and how they might live in the wild.  Yet, I also think that some zoo animals aren't getting the treatment that they deserve.  Animals deserve to be in their natural habitat and granted zoos don't quite provide that for them.  I know I wouldn't want to be caged in a pen with no freedom to roam around.  I will say though that I am torn on whether to have zoos or not.  On one side they give a glimpse of what I might never get to see in person yet they don't give the real live glimpse of what they would be like in the wild.  Circuses are totally different.  I have seen some of the news stories on circus animals and how they are treated and I think that it is wrong.  Animals weren't put on this earth for our pure entertainment by being beat to perform tricks.  SOme of the animals don't even have enough room to turn around in their cages.  I think that there needs to be some new laws and reform done on circus legislation.  Circuses totally degrade the respect of nature.  Nature should deserve more respect.

===message:What do I think about zoos?  I'm totally against them because animals should be able to roam in their own niches.  If you don't have a habitat you don't have a address and people can locate where you live.  

Zoos don't allow natural random gene flow in the evolution of species.  If you control their behavior and habits and later release these animals into the wild, they will not be capable of competing with other similar species in the gene pool.  They are week because their genes are not conditioned like the wild ones.  For example, if you keep a pet as a tiger and let it go back to Siberia.  It will die in the cold and will be weak.

Zoos should only be good for temporary purposes like education.  This education should include educating people in the destruction of their habitats and showing the impact of anthropogenic causes that have resulted in animals who are put on the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

However, I do feel bad for the animals.  I don't feel very bad for the smaller animals like lizards and some birds, b/c while they are kept in cages, they are fed well, kept clean and healthy, and they would probably be pets if they weren't in the zoo.  I feel bad for the larger animals.  Keeping a tiger or an elephant in a zoo may be interesting and educational, but it's simply not fair to the animals.  They should be in their natural habitat with room to roam, not kept in a tiny (relative to their size) cage.<BR>
There is a difference when the animal is being kept due to injury.  In such instances I think that zoos are appropriate and even helpful.  It also makes me feel better to know that while I'm enjoying looking at a poor caged animal that they are only being kept there until they are healed.  I also think zoos are appropraite places to keep animals that have been injured so bad that they can't be returned to the wild.  The justifaction for this is at least they are living, even if it is in a zoo.<BR>
As fir places like Sea World, I think that it is absolutley NOT okay for whales to be captured for the sole purpose of being entertainment value.  If they are injured and Sea World helps them, especially if they are unable to return to their natural habitat, then I think it is okay for them to be used as entertainment.  Not only does it pay the bills for Sea World, but it also gives the scientific world some insight on the behaviors of whales.

===message:I believe the purpose of zoos has been greatly changing over the past fifty years or so.  It is my opinion that the first zoos were simply for the entertainment of people, without taking into consideration the effects that captivity may have on the animals.  In the more recent past, however, zoos seem to have taken on the role of educational teachers and conservators of wildlife.  While zoos still seek to entertain and attract visitors, I believe their purpose has become much deeper.  Some ways that this is being reflected are in better (and larger) zoo facilities and attempts to immitate natural habitats, as well as captive breeding programs, and the intesive studying of animal behavior that will allow scientists to better understand the animals and how they can be preserved.  I do believe that zoos help make the public aware of issues surrounding animals that can be found in the zoos and their wildlife conditions (although much more could potentially be done).  If people are able to tangibly see some of the endangered animals they may be more willing to help conserve those animals in the wild.  While zoo animals do a lot for the education of people and thus possibly for protection of their species in the wild, I must admit that from the perspective of the animals in the zoo, zoo life can be less than desirable.  While the animals are taken care of, there is necessarily a loss of freedom and this can of course be personally detremental to animals.  There is also the factor of human intervention in animal care and everyday life which could adversely affect the animals (for example, the proper "socialization" of some animals by their group may not occur).  <BR>
I do not agree with having captive sea mammals at places like Sea World.  The fact that these animals are made to perform tricks for the entertainment of people is degrading and wrong.  I believe it would be different if we simply had the animals on display for the education of people (as in zoos) and not specifically for performing tricks.  In my opinion, it is not okay if killer whales and other animals are caught in the ocean for the sole purpose of being at Sea World and similar entertainment establishments.

I think people can see how important the natural world is and the need to care for and protect it and its creatures.  I think zoos are more capable of portraying this than a book, or a spokes person.  As a parent I have seen the wonder, amazement, and respect for the animals that children experience at  a zoo.  When my parents were children zoos were just about entertainment.  Today zoos are place to educate the public.  Children today are growing up with new messages about animals and preservation.  For many, going to a zoo is the first time they think about animals and their fate.
   On the other hand, I don't think that animals in the circus are there for educational reasons.  these animals are only there for show and entertainment.  the animals are not in large places modeled after their habitat.

Unfortunately, I feel this degrades these noble creatures.  No matter how well they are cared for and how closely their naatural habitat is simulated, it is just plain unnatural for the animals.  I find zoos to be, in general, a depressing place.  It would give me a great thrill to run up and down the sidewalk unlatching each pen.  Observing them in their natural habitat, doing what they naturally do, is far more thrilling to me because 1) it is a true glimpse of their existence, 2) it is a rare privilege, 3) it is an elusive opportunity that can't be replicated.  (I hope to go to a wild game preserve in Africa one day!)

I don't like to see animals performing at Sea World or the circus.  Again, it is unnatural and done solely for human gratification.

===message:Zoos have their pros and cons; there are also major differences between zoos.  On the one hand, zoos can act as research centers and wildlife preserves, aiding with the restoration of endangered species.  On the other hand, some zoos have environments that may actually be harmful to the animals.  Many zoos try to re-create as much as possible the natural environment of the animal.  Although this may make the animal harder to see for the visitor, an animal living in a zoo should not be in a barren cage.  Zoos can be very informative as well, and increase awareness about endangered species.  But there need to be regulations to make sure that there are standards for the animal habitats and animal treatment.  If zoos are maintained properly, they can be very beneficial.
Circuses are another story.  It is not natural for tigers and lions to do tricks in a cage or for bears to dance in tutus, and I don't have much confidence in the way these animals are treated.  Animals do not exist just for our entertainment.

1.What is the value of zoos? Do they help to educate people about species and make people more likely to contribute to conservation causes? Or, do they only exist for entertainment and are simply another example of man's attempt to dominate nature?
The only value I can see from zoos, is that they can educate students about aniamls from all over the world, plus vegetations, locations, etc.

2 Are zoos a good thing from the perspective of the animals in the zoo? 
From the animal's persepctyive, I would say no. How would you feel if someone came to your home and took you away from your friends and family and made you live in an enclosed space without any freedome. I really don't like circus who cage up animals either.

3. What are your personal thoughts and feelings when you visit a zoo; do you feel sadfor the animals, are you excited by seeing new things, are you amazed at the natural world?
When I visit the zoo I feel sad for the aniamls. Gee, the first time I moved from IL to IA I cried at the cows in the pastures.But they are so cute and neat to see in person and give them appreciation for what they are.


4. If killer whales and such are caught in the ocean specifically for the purpose of being at Sea World is that OK?
NO.

5. What about animal acts at circuses? Does this show the proper respect for nature?
Circus's just always seem so dirty and nasty. I can never remember seeing a clean circus with aniamls. They always looked so lonely and ill.  I donm't think it's right to make them constantly train to doo tricks. They should appreciate the animal and repect it for its communication to us.
