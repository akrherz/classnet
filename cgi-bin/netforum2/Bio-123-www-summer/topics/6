===more:Discussion proposal 1:  I would agree to give people in need of food the grain, as long as the grain was received by those people.  The problem with some countries are the leaders of the governments.  The leaders will either not let the grain get to the needy or will do whatever they can to disrupt the flow of this food, including taking the grain and selling it for profit.  Some leaders believe it is easier to control the people if they have very little money, food, education, and medical supplies.  So somehow we need to make sure the people that need the supplies can actually receive them.
Discussion proposal 2:  The United States already has a 10 year reserve program.  This was established to set aside ground from grain production reducing the amount of carry-over of grain that has occured in the past.  The problem of the United States setting aside more acreage from production is that every time we do this South America increases their destruction of rain forests.  So the destruction of the rain forest in my eyes is due to greedy people more than the fact that our livestock consumes so much grain.  I do believe the American people over indulge in the food they eat, and could lessen the amount of meat they eat by blending the meat in with noodles, pasta, rice and other dishes.  Instead of two people setting down to eat a three pound roast, they could  use some of the beef for beef and rice, some for beef and noodles, and some for stew.  This would be three meals from the same 3 pound roast.  We also would be using more grain products that are used for making spaghetti, noodles and so forth.  This could be a way of providing more food for other people and still be able to eat meat.
