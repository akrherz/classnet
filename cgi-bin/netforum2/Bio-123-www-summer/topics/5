===more:<P>Join the discussion about zoos.  You can address some or all of the questions below.<P>

What is the value of zoos?  Do they help to educate people about species and make people more likely to contribute to conservation causes?  Or, do they only exist for entertainment and are they simply another example of man’s attempt to dominate nature? Are zoos a good thing from the perspective of the animals in the zoo?  What are your personal thoughts and feelings when you visit a zoo; do you feel sad for the animals, are you excited by seeing new things, are you amazed at the natural world?<P>

What about captive sea mammals at places like Sea World?  Is it degrading to the animals to have them perform tricks for us?  If killer whales and such are caught in the ocean specifically for the purpose of being at Sea World is that OK?<P>

What about animal acts at circuses?  Does this show the proper respect for nature?
