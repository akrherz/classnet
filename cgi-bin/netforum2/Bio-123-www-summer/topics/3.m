===message:Proposal 1: I don't think that this solution is a good one in the long run.  It is important for us to help others that do not have enough food, but I think that we should help them learn to grow more grain to feed their country instead of having to worry about buying it from us.  This will help them in the long run to be more self-supporting and be able to feed their own people with out having to rely on other outside sources.  I also think that we tend to overlook those people who are undernourished or malourished in our own country and should focus on feeding them.

  Proposal 2:  It is important for us to eat not so far up on the food chain, but we need to thing about what will happen economically and environmentally if we reduce livestock production.  Livestock contribute to deforestation because of overgrazing and trampling of land, however livestock eat the grain that we can't eat.  So will we really be able to feed more people if we decrease livestock grazing?  I don't think so just because livestock eat the less desirable grain that is not suitable for human consumption.  I think that we need to focus on distribution of food and grain.  We currently produce enough grain to feed everyone, but it is not getting to those who really need it because of various reasons (ie war, politics, poverty).

By giving away our surplus this may help to raise the corn and soybean prices in the midwest,by increasing demand.  However this may be very costly to the United States in the long run.  The US will have to buy all excess grain from farms and pay for the transportation of the grain to other countries.
preposal 2: This would be a good idea if their was a food shortage world wide. This does not seem to be the case. About one year ago the hog industry was so bad that people had a hard time giving pigs away, There was not enough demand for the amount of meat that was being produced.

This is a very complex and controversial issue.  I will take a stand that this is not a very good idea.  It is a tragedy that 0.75 billion people in the world are undernourished.  It is also a terrible thought that so many children die each day from malnutrition and infections related to this issue.  However, it seems to me that if these countries are to thrive and survive on their own it would be much more appropriate to teach them how to deal with their own food problems.  Money and time could be much more appropriately invested in these coutries teaching the people agricultural practices that they can utilize on their lands to feed themselves.  Resisting giving them our excess food seems rather morbid, yet we must realize are own country is not without problems.  We have 20 million people undernourished in the US as well.  If we are to be giving food supplies freely to anyone, it should be them in my opinion.  I believe that we should assist other countries in feeding themselves, not handing over free supplies to them.  Giving a man a portion of grain will feed him for a day, but teaching him how to grow it will feed him for a lifetime.
<BR>
Proposal 2:
I do not believe that we should all become vegetarians to help feed the hungry people of the world.  Livestock production is clearly a more wasteful way of using grain supplies.  We lose 90% of grain's energy value by feeding it to cattle.  However, much of the sources used to feed livestock is not grain, but rangeland.  Much of this land is either too rocky, sloped, or dry to be utilized by farming.  I believe it would be very useful to decrease our livestock consumption to the level that it could be provided solely off of rangeland.  I think that we could perhaps eat half as many meat products as we do today and still almost benefit as much becoming complete vegatarians.  Americans each much more protein from animal sources than they need to be healthy.  Perhaps reducing consumption of protein from 100 grams per day to 40 grams per day would help decrease world hunger.  This would not mean that people would have to be complete vegetarians, still benefiting from many healthy components of meat.

But the extreme complications of such actions might want to be considered before getting involved in such a situation.  These include determining who is needed and who is not.  How to determine how much grain each country needs.  And you would have to be carefull to not set up a dependence from other coutries on our free donations.

And in regards to the hungry people of the world I believe even if some how you got everyone to be vegetarians some people would still remain hungry.  This would be due to the fact that some areas couldn't produce enough food for themselves and would need other areas to always give them food.  These other areas I don't think would be very eager to do this.  And even if they did a distribution problem would still exist.

I think that this is the major issue with giving the surplus grain away.  Second of all with this issue if the government was willing to buy the surplus grain from farmers at a reasonable price then that would help the farm economy greatly, which in turn helps the overall economy, yet, still giving to the less nourished.

Discussion Proposal 2: This issue is not all that cut and dry.  People nowadays are stuck in their ways on how they live and eat and this includes the eating of meat.  Granted people of the world would be fed and the environment would benefit, but what would happen to all of the livestock that is currently here.  A big issue that needs to be addressed is if everyone became a vegetarian is how would livestock producers, meat packing plant employees and even grocery stores make a living without that capital that they get from selling livestock products.

political power over undeveloped countries. For example, the more money you give your friend the more
he/she will use you for more money. So that is why the U.S. has been a dominate force in controlling trade
sactions, political power in U.N. meetings, and a driving force for feeding malnutritious people in third world
countries. It comes down to who has the technology and capability to make the most food and control trade
sactions. If I ran the country I would educate third world peasants on how to run sustainable agriculture and
grow organic crops. Spending money on food production is a waste, but allocating those fund to educational
purposes is a more practical and appliable to feed people around the world. My opinion on discussion
proposal 2 is that it is cool that vegetarians are resorting to other kinds of foods beside eating beef from
cows. I think bovids, especially cows are the most unefficient animals who have very poor meat quality and
just the amount of calories eat doesn't turn into lean meat. This is probably the reason most people resort to
a vegetarian lifestyle becuase the way they think of meat is gross and not pleasing in a slaughter house, for
example. We should resort to eating bison, zebras, or gazelle meat. These animals are more efficient in
foraging and feeding grasses.

The leaders will either not let the grain get to the needy, or will do whatever they can to disrupt the flow of this food; including taking the grain and selling it for profit.  Some leaders believe it is easier to control the people if they have very little money, food, education, and medical supplies.  So somehow we need to make sure the people that need the supplies can actually receive them.  
2.  The United States already has a 10 year reserve program.  This was established to set aside ground from grain production, reducing the huge amount of surplus grain that we have produced over the years.  The problem with the United States setting aside these acres from production is that every time we do this, South America increases the destruction of the rain forest.  So the destruction of the rain forest in my eyes is due to greedy people more than the fact that our livestock consumes so much grain.  I do believe the American people over indulge in the food they eat, and could lessen the amount of meat they eat by blending the meat in with Noodles, pasta, rice, and other dishes.  Instead of two people setting down to eat a three pound roast, they instead could use some of the beef for beef and rice, beef and noodles, stew, and others.  This would be three meals from the same three pound roast.  We also would be using more grain products by eating more noodles, spaghetti, and rice.  This could be a way of tweeking our eating styles a little bit, but allow more meat and grain products to be used elsewhere.

Proposal 1 - Why should the U.S. government be responsible for bailing out countries who have exceeded the carrying capacity of their land?  Most of the countries who can't raise the grain themselves or afford to buy the grain from us are developing countries who have incredible populations.  By giving them handouts, aren't we just supporting their way of life and allowing them to take advantage of us?  Maybe we should hand out grain to countries like China as a reward for lowering their birthrate.  But even in that case, who's to foot the bill for feeding the people in other countries - Joe Taxpayer.  A lot of people in our country have a hard time living day to day with what they earn.  The last thing we need is to jack up their tax rates even higher to feed the starving masses in Kenya or India.<BR>
Proposal 2 - The only ways to get this proposal to work is to either get a dramatic shift in people's thinking or to legislate it some how.  Since a strong majority of people eat meat in some form it is unlikely that everyone will suddenly change their eating habits.  So if we legislate it, what are going to be the rules and repercussions?  Are we going to have the meat cops following you into the back alleys where you try to buy black market meat from unsafe, unsanitary distributors?  Maybe blood or urine tests to screen people for illegal meat use.  There are hundreds of thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the meat industry in some way.  Sure, we have an economy that could use the workers, but not that many I'm sure.  What's going to happen to all of those people?  They won't be able to support their families by themselves, so many of them will apply for government assistance, putting a tremendous strain on the welfare system, probably bankrupting it.  What then?  Higher Taxes?  Starvation?  Food riots?  A collapse of our system of government as we know it?  It boggles the imagination.  Plus, if we stopped eating meat, wouldn't that cause most species of cow, hog, and other domesticated animals to become extinct?

We should give away surplus grain to those countries that can't afford to buy it from us. Umm...no.  It's a nice idea in THEORY, but would never work.  First, we would have to pay to get it there b/c they can obviously not afford to buy it from us.  This leads to problems in itself that have already been discussed by many people.  For instance, raising taxes would be the most likely way to pay to transport the grain.  This would never happen.  it would never pass legislation, and if by some miracle it did, people would be upset and make enough noise that it simply wouldn't work.  My second point comes from a little life lesson that has been taught to me throughout the years.  "Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day.  TEACH a man how to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime."  Now, if we substitute the word "grain" for "fish" we can see where I'm going.  understandably there are problems with things such as cropland and climate, etc. but it has been proven time and time again by organizations such as the Red Cross (or whoever does the overseas work these days) that it is much more effective to take the grassroots approach to helping people rather than just handing stuff to them and taking the bureaucrats solution. <BR>

We should all beome vegetarians.  Once again, I don't think so.  I'll be one of the first people to smack the person that says I can't eat my Whopper.  People like meat.  people eat meat.  people NEED meat...afterall it is protein. and eating my Whopper is a much tastier way to get my daily protein requirements than eating a big bowl of beans.<BR>  

In addition, if we all become vegetairians , then the entire animal raising industry would go under.  There are the obvious effects of lost wages and jobs on those in the industry, but if you look further, becoming vegetarians creates larger problems.  For instance, if we aren't raising animals, we don't even get any mean byproducts.  That sounds icky, but for instance, there wouldn't be any more milk b/c cows are raised on grain (even if only 50% of their diet comes from it).  Milk is an imprtant thing in a persons diet!  There would be no more eggs.  How are you going to make a cake or a bathc of muffins without eggs?  I'm sorry, but EggBeaters just ain't the same thing.  Even Jello has animal products in it!  
Thus, the moral of this story is, is that no matter how much good it may do for everyone to become vegetairan, it is just to hard to implement and enforce.  In addition, all sorts of products, from Jello to jackets, are made from animals.  becomming vegetarians would dramatically shift our lives as we know them and the remedy to such a situation could end up causing even more problems than the current one of hunger.

===message:Proposal 1:  It is my opinion that although giving surplus grain to those countries that can't afford to buy it from us may alleviate the immediate starvation problem, it will not solve the food crisis problem--and in fact would probably make it bigger.  The populations of many developing countries are increasing at an alarming rate.  The more people that are produced, the more people there are that starve to death.  However, I realize that developed countries shouldn't just turn their backs on the food crisis problems of developing nations.  I believe we have a moral obligation to help all people to a better standard of living and the optimal solution to the food crisis may actually be a combination of sending birth control (and education about it and why it is important) and food to developing nations. <BR>
Proposal 2:  I believe that this isn't a bad proposal to free up grain that might be sent to developing nations, but there are some big drawbacks to the proposal.  Becoming vegetarians would allow for more grain consumption by people but it is possible that problems such as protein deficiency may arise if people did not know or seek out other sources of protein besides meat.  As discussed in the rationale for proposal 2, we would also only gain grain off of land that could not be used only for rangeland and therefore there probably would not be a significant reduction in the environmental effects of livestock production.  This would be due to the fact that rangeland would still be overgrazed and any land that would be converted to growing grain for people-consumption would then likely suffer environmental degredation by the farming practices used to grow that grain.  Yet another problems relates to proposal 1, and that is that sending grain will not solve the food crisis.  As population grows, overgrazing and desertification increases and crop productivity stabilizes.  These are not detremental trends that can be solved by simply becoming vegetarians.

The consumption food facts are quite distressing and the U.S. could help alleviate these conditions of undernutrition, malnutrition, and death.  In lecture we have learned that not all soils and climates are suitable for growing crops.  Many of these under developed nations are in areas like this. So, helping to bring agricultural technology to these areas to improve farming will have little effect.  Many people would be upset with the idea of giving food away for free.  Perhaps, there could be nonmonetary payment for grain.  Something like the "debt for nature swap."  Some of these countries could agree to put aside forests as protected areas for grain, or establish habitat for the indigenous, endangered wildlife.  Politics also come into play in many of these countries.  Often time the food doesn't make it to the people for various political reasons.  Perhaps grain would only be given to countries that demonstrate that the grain is getting to those who need it.  I think it is irresponsible to allow peop[le in other countries to die of starvation and malnutrition because their government is unable to pay for grain.  
Proposal 2.  I think it would be difficult to enforce a vegetarian lifestyle upon all the people of the world.  However, I think there are some very valid arguments for the idea. In my opinion, we should consider only eating meat from free range animals.  Then the grain used for fedd lot animals would be available for people.  This would feed an extra "250million" in the US so, worldwide this could have a huge impact.  Because rangeland is not suitable for agriculture, this is not land that would be utilized better for growing crops.  Those who work in the meat industry could still have jobs there.  I think people nned to become more informed about where there food comes form and the impact of their food choices.

The problem with this proposal is that most people tend to get caught up in the 'but I like meat' thing.  Let's just assume that being a vegetarian is an enjoyable diet (I've been one for 5 years and it's by no means a bland or boring diet).  It would be great if everyone decreased their meat intake.  Vegetarianism is much more sustainable and healthy.  But I'm a realistic person and I know this can't really happen.  I don't know how it would be possible to make such a radical change in our eating habits.  On a smaller scale, though, even if not everyone becomes vegetarian, as more and more people do just that, or at least lower their meat consumption, it's still freeing up more grain and more resources.  And even if it's not logical to send these resources to other countries, it is also better for our own environment.

The Government, aren't we in enough debt as it is.  If we collected all the money other countries owe us the U.S. debt would greatly decrease or even not exist.  I think that is pretty giving, not asking for the money other countries owe us.  
Would the farmers just give away their grain without any compensation?  I don't think so.

===subject:Become a vegetarian?
===message:This too is a good idea and would hopefully safe lives and a lot of negative affects on the environment.  But, realistically it would be nearly impossible to convince such a large amount of the public to become vegetarian.  You would cause more resistance and headaches than it would be really worth.  Going along with the other discussion, even if we did have surplus grain for other countries, can they affort it.  Would we give it away?  What good would extra grain be it we couldn't get it to the people who need it.

===message:Proposal 1:  I think this is a noble idea but not very practical.  First, I think it would create a dependant relationship.  What happens in years when the U.S. government has a small surplus or no surplus?  This act of kindness wouldn't prepare these countries for self-sufficiency.  It also puts the U.S. in a dominant position, politically.  They would be able to withhold surplus food for the other country's promise to elect a certain leader or ban certain things.  Morally, this is a very slippery slope.  Second, who would provide the cost for transportation and distribution?  This would be a very large expense.  Third, this would, inevitablly create a blackmarket and would still not guarantee that those individuals truly in-need would actually receive the surplus grain.  Perhaps this is a cynical view but history has many examples of this behavior.


Proposal 2:  Again, this is a noble idea but not a very practical one.  I think it is very unlikley that Americans would become vegetarians voluntarily.  A country like the U.S. which was founded on individual freedom would never be able to legislate vegetarian diets for it's citizens.  Hypothetically, IF everyone did become vegetarians, I'm not sure if it would solve all of the environmental problems related to livestock production.  It may diminish them but their would likely be an equal or greater impact that we haven't even yet begun to ponder.  For example, it might very rapidly and thoroughly diminish the soil nutrients necessitating greater nitrogen applications, causing greater run off, causing mass eutrophication of waterbodies (perhaps even the ocean in some places) devestating fish and marine organisms.  Natural resources have such a delicate balance that even small shifts can have a large impact.  As far as becoming vegetarians to help ease world hunger, I think the arguements in Proposal 1 are relevant here as well.

===message:The distribution of surplus grain may sound like a good idea from afar, but is not very practical.  First of all, who is going to pay for the transportation and reimburse the farmers?  I am sure they do not want to give it away.  Second of all, who do you give the grain too?  There are very many needy people, and it would be a difficult choice.  Also, some years there may not be a significant surplus of grain, and these countries that have been receiving our gratitude will again be starving because they have learned to depend on us.  These countries need to create independent food sources; if we want to help them, maybe we could educate them about more sustainable methods of agriculture.
The vegetarian idea is a bit ridiculous.  As it explained, becoming a vegetarian would on average create enough food to feed one more person.  Take all Americans and subtract the already vegetarians, and that is a substantial amount.  However, it is not a feasible idea and the fact that people eat meat is not at the heart of world hunger.  The free ranging idea is good, but doesn't that use more land, cutting down more forests.  Maybe a good alternative to vegetarianism would be to stop eating beef; this would save on a lot of grain AND land use.

===message:Our country may be the strongest and have the most fertile soils in the world but should others hold this against us.  We cannot just give things away.  If we started to give our surplus grain away the grain markets would crash and we would have alot of poor farmers ojn our hands and then we would have no grain simple as that.

===message:1.Yes We should give our surplus to the hunger people in other countries.  I think that we should exploite the Earth sustainably so with no surplus, but if we make surplus we should help others in trouble.  This is just a global view on this problem.
2.This cannot be done.  We might reduce use of meat, but we cannot stop eating it because of need for nutritions and vitamins necessary for humans life.
