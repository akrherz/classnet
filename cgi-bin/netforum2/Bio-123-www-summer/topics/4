Animals are a part of our life.  We use animals for food and other products; we use them for recreation and transportation; we use them for entertainment as we watch them is zoos, in the wild, or on TV nature shows; we use them as models for humans in testing out drugs and medical procedures; we hunt them.  

<P>We are often asked to make decisions about the fate of animal species: which ones should or should not be used in research, which one should or should not be used for testing cosmetics, which one should be saved from extinction, which ones should or should not be hunted, what punishment should people get for torturing animals, what are humane practices in raising animals for food.  

<P>These decisions depend on how we value animal species and the relative value we place on them compared to our own species.  By filling out the Road Kill Dilemma worksheet you have discovered the relative value you place on different species.  Paste your responses to the Road Kill Dilemma below and then write something below that which explains the rationale behind your judgments if you can verbalize it (it may just be a gut feeling you can’t explain).  

<P>Don’t worry about how I, or anyone else, will feel about your responses.  You will not be graded on what your responses are; you will receive full credit simply by participating.  Feel free to respond to the messages of other people as long as you treat their opinions with respect.
