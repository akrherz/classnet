===message:Giving food away to malnourished countries is a very expencive thing to do since we would have to transport it.  It is easy to talk about the government paying for this but ultimately we as the taxpayers will be the ones to pay for it.  The tax burden in this country is already high and contributes to malnourished children and adults amoung our own poor especially the homeless. If we are going to give it away we could feed our own hungry first.
