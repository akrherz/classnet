===message:I thought you made some good points on both issues, but I do believe the need to help malnourished people all over the world is a problem that will always be there.  The U.S. will probably always be providing free food in some form just due to our humanitarian nature as long as we continue to produce the amount of food we have today or more.

===message:What you may be overlooking are the economic realities of your proposal 2.  If we reduce the number of animals by such a drastic amount, the prices of meat would skyrocket out of the average persons price range.  That in itself could force people into vegetarianism just because of monetary situations.
