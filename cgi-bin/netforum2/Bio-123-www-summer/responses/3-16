===message:I am not for everyone becoming vegetarians either, but you have to understand the facts at least.  When you stated "the environmental effects of livestock production is not a big problem in the world", you were misrepresenting yourself.  It is a big problem and especially when other countries, undeveloped ones for sure, raise the level of livestock they are producing after the american model, the effects will be much worse.  Especially when most of these countries will take less than half of the environmental cautions that we take.
