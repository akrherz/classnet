===message:You evidently were raized outside of the U.S. and have the perspective from someone who may have seen the negatives of the U.S. government foreign policies.  I believe the U.S. people truely want for these poorer foreign countries to produce enough food and products to sustain a way of life and to become more educated.  I do believe, that money spent to increase food production is very important to meet the needs of the future populations.  Money spent on educating these people is also very important.  I myself wish the U.S. did not have to provide the amount of money to foreign countries that we do, but I also believe that many foreign economies would fold without our support.  
The bison and gazelle may be very lean which is good, but if we eat those type of animals world wide, I don't believe that it would be long before they would be extinct, or they would have to be raised in mass quantities such as we do for cattle, hogs, and poultry to meet the demand for this product.

===message:I agree with the fact that bovines are innefficient in their  kilocalorie conversion, but whose meat is more palatable? Have you ever eaten Gazzelle, Zebra or Bison? What about the kilocalorie conversions of fish and Chickens, relatively efficient compared to the cow and definately more palatable than a zebra burger.
