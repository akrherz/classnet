===subject:The possibility exists
===message:At first glance one is tempted to say no, it couldn't happen here based on the scale differences between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the confined basin of the Black Sea. However after considering some of the biology involved the answer is not as absolute.

First, is the plants in the water that create the oxygen needed to support the animal life. Most of the larger plants (seaweeds and such) live in the shallow waters of the continental shelf. Actually not even out that far. Most photosynthesis takes place in the top 100 feet of the ocean. All it takes to destroy the base of the coastal food chain is pollution of the nearshore coast. Any substance in the water (even dirt) blocks the sunlight. Some sewage feeds animals which also feed on the seaweeds (like sea urchins. These then can multiply and take out whole forests (they have in California). In a natural system, if the predator eats up its food supply its population will also crash giving the plants a chance to recover. However, the urchins can stay alive on the sewage in large enough numbers that any plant that manages to drift into the area is eaten. The area is now barren. Even though much of the ocean's photosynthesis comes from the micro plants that float throughout the ocean it doesn't do much for the coastal fishes and etc. 

A second problem in the Black Sea was the water quality of the contributing rivers. This applies to us as well. Historically the river towns dumped their waste in the rivers and it was then out of sight. The consequence for the ocean hundreds of miles away was of no importance. This attitude is still with us as river towns ask why they should spend money to treat their waste in oder to protect my beach. There is now greater awareness of the global nature of problems but solutions that assess the true environmental costs are almost never chosen.

A third problem in the Black sea was overfishing. We are seeing that in many areas along our coasts. The native salmon are almost gone, the cod fishery in Newfoundland, lobsters in Maine, halibut in California, whale populations everywhere...

In conclusion, I think we could decimate the coastal regions in a manner similar to the Black Sea. While some fisheries would still exist in the deeper, more remote areas and micro critters still produce oxygen out there most of our economic activity involving the oceans is in the coastal zone.

===subject:Possible and Probable
===message:Yes, I do for a number of reasons.  The first being economic.  While the state of the Black Sea can be attributed to ill-conceived state policies of many nations and political ideologies, their impetus was ultimately economic: farmers wanting better irrigation, fisherman over fishing fish populations. Hydro-electric engineers searching for cheaper electricity, beach front developers building at any location, and oil companies drilling anywhere.  Indeed, a significant percentage of the blame for the Black Sea can be laid at the feet of economic desires.  While the motivation of much of the development in and around the Black Sea is not greed driven, as in the US, the same consequences, the moribund state of the Black Sea, could be achieved.  Indeed, the goal of Capitalism is the accumulation of wealth, albeit by consensual and informed exchanges.  However, Capitalism is not concerned with its second or tertiary consequences.  For example, Capitalism was little concerned with child labor, 12-hour workday, or the safety of workers.  Capitalism is about making money with limited appraisal of the methods used make money.  Capitalism is only worried about the cheapest way to do something.  In fact, it is a system rotten ripe for the neglect of the environment at its most benign state and abuse of the environment at its most perverse.
	The second reason centers upon the political.  That is, when there is a decision to be made between the environment and a perceived need of the people, the environment looses, inevitable.  We need only to look at the state of America’s beaches to find an example, specifically, Miami Beach.  As a tourist haven with hopes of maximizing its beauty for economic gain, Miami has allowed development right up to the beach.  The consequences have been catastrophic.  For one, Miami Beach is no longer natural.  It is re-nourished continually.  Consequently, the consistency of the beach has changed.  It is no longer a viable ecosystem for sand crabs, birds or small organisms.  One can only wonder what concessions politicians will make when there is a supposed need by some of their citizenry.  Will we dam the Mississippi for electricity, open the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge for oil, or pollute our groundwater even more with pesticides or herbicides to increase our yield per acre.  I’m not sanguine about the political dimension.  Our political system seems incapable of making a decision that balances the needs of the polity with the needs of the environment, except in the most dire situations.
	The last reason I think it could happen here to our coastal areas is our level of ignorance of the consequences of human development.  The Black Sea is a prime example of catastrophic environmental degradation.  However, no one knows the exact cause or causes.  We know that chemical plants, human waste, the destruction of wet lands, over fishing, oil spills, nutrient pollution, and the introduction of alien species all contribute to the state of the Black Sea.  Saying that, I don’t know when humans will begin to line in complete harmony with the environment.  We will always it seems create pollution.  What we must do is determine to a scientific certainty how we are destroying our environment: what pollutants must we stop introducing into the environment, which pollutants can we adjust the levels of in our environment, and in what combination are they the most detrimental?  We are ignorant of our environment; we must not be any longer.  So, yes, it could happen to our costs.

===subject:Discussion #5 Could It Happen Here?
===message:I would have never guessed these two books would be so thought provoking.  First we went through relentless descriptions of self-inflicted damage to our beachfront areas and now we seem to be moving in the same light towards the once again, self-inflicted, damage of the ocean floor, flood-plain areas, and subsequent affects on species.  The more I read the more upset I get at "us".  Upset for letting this happen.  It would be nice to sit here and say we were simply uninformed and ignorant to what was occuring, but the truth appears that we have been warned from the science field for years.  Something needs to be done in order for us understand this is our only means of life support, mother earth, she is what sustains us and she is asking for treatment from a gentler hand.  The question, "Do you think this level (re: Black Sea) of pollution along the coast could happen in the US?"  Yes, of course, without a doubt, we are easily capable of creating catastrophes.  The Texas coast has routinely experienced the "red tide" and fish kills since the late 1980's.  It was thought to be attributed to increased nitrogren levels from farm and livestock runoff.  Apparently this is correct.  Louisiana has much to be feared.  The state's economy is oil and natural gas based.  Our society demands we have supplies of both.  In someways, the criticism is unfair at times from the public.  On one hand we want to be use domestic fuels, we just don't want to harm a blade of grass to do it.  I seldom see less people at the fuel station or them buying less gas, taking less trips, and it is unlikely these folks are contributing to any type of conservancy fund trying to offset the damage from modern advances to farming, mining, and industry that seemingly has the largest impacts on our environment.  Economics continue to drive our actions.  Isn't it simply amazing how the upper midwest has had such a detrimental effect on the flood-plain of the Mississippi River?  Do you think the folks of New Orleans are going to be happy with our abundance of corn while the high tide line laps at their levee?  Boy, how little have we understood our "progress" of the past.  Human nature seems resistant to change, at least quickly; therefore, the situation may have to get worse before it gets better.  But, I believe, though we may not be able to reverse mistakes [like the levee that lines the Mississippi River and the building of a great city (New Orleans) in an area so prone to risk], we will not let this continue to the point that we have lost everything as in the case of the Black Sea.  How my heart goes out to those folks surrounding the Black Sea.  Maybe it is blind faith on my part, but I think science will help us solve our current pollution loading on the environment.  The new question may be, "Will technology ever keep up with population growth?"   I have a little bit of both, Hobbes and Locke, in me.  When unrestrained, the human race can run wild and make some terrifically stupid blunders, but when educated, it can also act with resolve.  Much as the case of air emissions and the affects of acid rain, "sorry Canada, we didn't mean to send you all of that over the years"...smile.  We do learn from our mistakes hopefully before we create another case study of the Passenger Pigeon.  At the same time, we cannot pretend that the world will not continue to change and evolve.  Each new century brings a different face to our planet.  We will feed ourselves.  We are not going back to candlelight.  Each generation likely longs for some aspect of times gone by, e.g. broader natural beaches, unspoiled natural areas, seemingly endless fish stocks, less crime, or whatever.  Yet those generations weren't supplying food, fuel, and shelter for 6 billion people either.  Twenty years from now we will look back and see this as a turning point, it is up to us to help determine if it is to be seen as memory of what once was or what we knew it could be.  Get active and do not let the Black Sea result happen here.  No one else will stop this from happening to us but us!    Capt. Dave

1) A portion of our economy depends upon the quality of the water around our coastal regions, and the people involved in these industries are able to talk directly to there congressmen and help influence policy.<br><br>

2) Although we tend to be ignorant at the beginning of natrual destruction, as it gets further out of hand and much more dangerous, we tend to go to the opposite extreme and over-compensate in our conservitive nature.<br><br>

3) Although a lot of resources are being spent to capitalize on the exploitation of our beaches and coastal areas, the livelihood of those businesses are eventually dependant upon the survival of those very coastal areas.  In an interest to preserve their investment, these businesses will (hopefully) attempt to preserve the areas around them.<br><br>

4) Last but not least, the public is contiunually becoming more educated on these matters, including us and this class.  This matter will only get bigger and become more important as time goes on.

===message:A layperson reading this book "Ocean's End" could be convinced that the "chicken little syndrome" has taken over the world.  However, for many parts of the earth, such as the Black Sea, the sky has indeed fallen.  Without a fact men/women, let's be equal here, have either destroyed or damaged everything they have come in contact with.  From the rain forests of Brazil to the Black Sea we as humans do our best to take from nature without giving anything back. Yes like it or not we think only of ourselves.  Because of that we can see, in the Black Sea for an example, just what humans are capable of.  We would like to blame Eastern Europe's pollution on the Communists, and they certainly have to take a large responsibilty for the damage. But we in Iowa have added directly or indirectly to the death of parts of the Gulf of Mexico, and we consider ourselves a free democracy.  So there has to be more to pollution than the type of government.  Why just last week I read where a Iowa hog farmer polluted a river, he's done it before, with hog manure that escaped from a confinment area, thousands of fish killed. (Why do they call it a confinment area?)  I still eat bacon, don't you?  Economics plays a large part in this story but it isn't the "whole" story.  To me greed is what drives men to pollute.  In the Eastern Bloc, under the Communists, greed drove the governments to keep people employed and content at all costs.  If this meant polluting a river, or a sea, so be it.  The people came first today and we won't worry about tomorrow.  Sound like somebody you know?  Can it happen here?  It can and has and to some extent still is.  Hopefully through government safeguards and enough people getting concerned about the environment we as humans can stop taking from mother nature without giving something back.  However, man's greed many times far outweighs his capacity for concern.

Some similar instances were described in Dean's book about the pollution and literal over-use of the oceans in the U.S. But I do not think the large scale pollution and poor management of the coastal zones that happened around the Black Sea will happen in the U.S. I just don't see the U.S. having a problem like this because the environmentalists would have a field day, and the media would eat potential problems such as this up... Our environmentalists would have a strong say in this matter, and I don't think people would ignore them if they saw results first-hand. (i.e. fish dying, rotten egg smell). Plus the Black Sea example can be used in a situation such as this to illustrate just how serious these problems can become. Although we over-pollute and in some cases over-abuse/use our beaches, Americans are too fond of these coastal areas to let them turn into lifeless dumps of odor and murky water.

===message:As much as I would like to think that the mistakes made that have destroyed to Black Sea would be noted by the rest of the world and that all would learn from them I don't think it will happen.  I do think that there will ever be another catastrophe of such speed as the Black Sea, however, but the severity of the situation may be much worse.  Citizens around the world are very aware of the problems that exist and becoming more educated each year of the effects pollution has on peoples lives both for health and economic reasons.  But when it comes down to it in the long run economic interests and the need to fulfill personal desires to live and work near oceans and lakes will prevail over the environmental protection interest.  Each year compromises will be made that allow for some development and some environmental protection, but generally the economic interest usually gains more while the environmental side loses more.  That is a very dangerous pattern for the environment.  The only way I can explain it is to compare it to professional athletes salaries.  Over the past hundred years they have steadily increased, some years more than others, and once the minimum reaches a certain level it is unheard of to go below that.  Every year they ask for more and every year they get it, they no longer play for the enjoyment of the game (regardless of what is said) they play for the money.  Never again will anyone be asked to play for less than millions of dollars it wouldn't be allowed and eventually the need for the money will probably kill the interest in the games.  If you can image the substitutions that would be made in terms of the environmental protection side it is easy to see that little bites here and there that are not easily noticed and much more dangerous than a large chunk that can be avoided.  Once people realize that the little bits are turning into a huge problem nothing of the seas of the past will be left and no one will really even remember what it used to be like just the same as my comparison to the sports world.  I know I got a little off subject, but even though the two subjects are very different I feel the patterns they follow and continue to follow are very much the same and will in the end destroy them both.

===message:I think that it is very possible for the US to experience pollution approaching the levels of the Black Sea.  I would think that it would be very hard to monitor every large company/factory/etc. with access to a waterway.  This allows dishonest and/or ruthless individuals an easy way to cut corners by dumping hazardous and other waste materials into the waterway.  Part of the blame for the Black Sea was also the extensive use of dams and concreted waterways, which blocked the flow of sediment and bypassed needed filtering bogs/marshes.  The U.S. uses a lot of these tactics for controlling waterways and gathering hydroelectric, so there is also risk from that avenue.<BR>
Another factor in the demise of the Black Sea was the introduction of a foreign species that became dominant, in the jellies.  The U.S. has been fighting a similar battle, with zebra mussels (I think, my memories are vague on this).  It seems that there are many similarities between the U.S. and the region surrounding the Black Sea.  Therefore, there exists a large possibility that the seas surrounding the U.S. could experience the same death.

The communist regimes of those countries and that area didn't really seem to either care, or know the long-term consequences of their actions. The government themselves did much harm to affect the ecosystem.<p>

Here in the U.S., we have a multitude of government agencies and non-profit agencies run by concerned and educated citizens that act as checks and balances (a fundamental concept in our form of government) to prevent commercial interets from causing that much damage, in terms of pollution and waste dumping, on the scale that it happened in the Black Sea area.<p>

Therefore, I don't think that it could quite reach that scale here: we are more aware of long-term consequences of what we do to our environment, both on land and at sea. There are a host of government laws and regulations forbidding and restricting the types of waste that can be dumped into the water systems inland and around our country's coasts.<p>

Although we maybe didn't understand for a long time the effects that coastal engineering would have on erosion of the coastline, we have for much longer than that understood the evils of waste dumping here. I think it safe to say, that our past understanding, coupled with continuing future education and further understanding, will keep us from killing our oceans and lakes nearby.<p>

We should still, however, be concerned with what our global neighbors are doing to their seas, since that can affect us in time, if it remains unchecked.

<br>
While you would think the US would be better off than distinct countries with a history of conflict, the conflicting interests of states in the US and the strong belief in federalism makes it equally difficult to regulate this potential disaster.  While I’ve enjoyed my three years in Iowa, I have seen some decisions by policy makers blinded to other valid interests for the sake of agriculture.  Don’t think Iowa is the only one.  My home state of Illinois is guilty as well as cattle ranchers in Montana and the corrupt government of Louisiana for allowing profits to come before the safety of its citizens.  Our government will be slow to do anything with so many big budget interests at stake an in the meanwhile the problem may approach the situation in Newfoundland where moratoriums have yet to reestablish populations.

But, the author points out, environmental issues can seem benign but often they are the ones that get the most fervor out of the public when something goes seriously awry.

Just like the Black Sea, the Gulf of Mexico currently is going through the same type of pollution problems.  As noted in Oceans End, the Muddied Waters chapter gives valuable information on how American citizens contribute to the contamination of ocean water.  The farmers in Northwest Hungary polluted the Black Sea with fertilizers and animal wastes, so are the farmers in the upper Mississippi watershed.  The Romanian beaches were destroyed by oil pollutants released by huge vessels, in deed in the Gulf of Mexico we has thousands of oil tankers slicing through habitat and releasing oil into the water.  The Black Sea has many huge companies surrounding the area that contributes to the polluted water, and this is exactly what Louisiana has, we call it Cancer Alley.  <P>This is only a small portion of all the evidence that suggests how the U.S. is destroying their coasts similar to the Black Sea. 
We have a huge problem in the Gulf of Mexico with jellyfish. They are numerous and they are growing larger then ever.  That’s exactly what the Black Sea is dealing with, invasive cnidarians (jelly type of marine organisms)!  I feel that we have a huge problem and that we need to do something about it now.

"Cancer Alley" is up and running; the U.S.'s increasing need of oil, and the tricky situation with the major producer of it doesn't gives us much hope about those natural gas, and oil wells to stop production. The increased popularity of plastics, and applied materials in daily life says a lot about the possibility of even trying a move that would jeopardize this industries in the Mississippi. Genetically altered crops, and cattle raised in the midwest states are increasingly appearing as a solution for cheap food, not only for the U.S. internal market, and it's exports to other nations, but also a choice to fight hunger in many countries in the world; providing that their governments abandon the unfounded fears about the risk of such products.
 <p> On the other hand, "colorful" politics home from the likes of Mr. Mike Foster, Gov. of Mississippi, show how grim the future looks like. Special Interests are indeed strong not only in Capitol Hill, but locally as well. Fearing the possibility of putting an end to their political careers, many politicians fail to represent their constituents's interests; many times is not a matter of being bought by the industry, but they represent the industry themselves.

Although this river is used for sewerage of human waste and other products, you can visually sea on a small scale how this river can become dead.  There are fish,and plants in this river;however if the government and the people of this nation place this priority low on their list then this river can become lifeless. If we continue to regulate waste,toxin, and pesticides in the river,and lakes then we have a chance of maintaining the creatiion of "live seas." The people of the United States need to regulate the rivers and lakes with a more valued ecosystem that will reduce pollution, toxin, and waste that will kill our way of sealife.

Much more likely in industrial and highly populated areas than anywhere else, the pollution from industries, waste, chemical runoff and the injecting of warming water into rivers, streams and lakes could easily turn any type of aquatic habitat into an aquatic wasteland. Also since water flows from place to place this pollution could easly be spread from smaller bodies of water to the oceans. 

I feel that one reason for dramatic loss of habitat in the Black Sea, is the fact that the water circulation rate between the Black Sea, and other bodies of water is so slow that it is simply a sitting pond that gets no circulation of new life. Many different factors play into the loss of life in the Black Sea, though pollution is a major part, but it doesn't mean that what happend there can't happen anywhere else.

Although a similar situation is beginning to occur in regards to the Mississippi and the seasonal dead zone in the Gulf, the Gulf will never entirely die as the Black Sea has done. <br>First, the United States does regulate (somewhat, perhaps not enough, but it does) the use of pesticides, chemicals, and other substances that pollute our rivers and tributaries. <br>This regulation occured because of (point #2) special interest groups, environmental lobbyists, and other groups within the United States who doggedly voice their concerns to our government. <br>Point #3: Our government is (somewhat)democratic. Our politicians, leaders, and policymakers are held responsible for their actions by the people. Environmental groups and other concerned citizens for this reason can impact policy decisions and create changes. <br>Correct me if I am misinformed, but Woodward's Ocean's End did not seem to mention any of these factors. No attempts by the government to regulate, no groups vehemently protesting the damage being done to the Black Sea, and obviously no democracy, at least circa the early problems and warning signs. These three key factors will keep the U.S. from repeating the same horrible mistakes made in regards to the Black Sea. Much damage may be done before we as a country can begin to correct the problems re runoff and the dead zone, but a situation such as that befell the Black Sea will not happen here.

<p>When citizens of an area find that some business is abusing the natural environment and destroying ecosystems in pursuit of the Almighty Dollar, they get really pissed and do what citizens of a representative republic do when they are really stinking mad: call their elected representative and threaten not to vote for her in the next election unless the problem is fixed.  Large numbers of angry constituents have an amazing influence on any politician who is interested in retaining either her job or her reputation.  It doesn't matter how long the politician has been in bed with an environmentally-abusive big business, if there is a really large group of really angry voters banging on the bedroom door, the environmental policies get changed.</p>

===subject:Costal Incentives - Just not there
===message:The likeliness of American coastlines to achieve the Black Sea’s deadly levels of pollution is strong.  While much of the pollution of the sea throughout the former USSR and the Eastern Bloc may be a result of their rigid and inefficient government and economy, the inability for policy makers to cast long term decisions at the cost of short run gains is not specific to any geography or ideology.
<p>The readings in this course have clearly demonstrated a growing yearning among Americans for the coastline. A wealthy, aging population has sought to realize their dreams of scenic beauty and temperate climates along much of America’s coast.  However, the migration of a population from the inland regions to coastal areas means a constituency of individuals largely ignorant of the delicacy of the coast now find themselves directly impacting it.  Can we cast aside the temporary illusions of the American dream in sacrifice for the continuity of our coastal areas?
<p>The incentives are not there for successful decisions.  Politicians must choose between the harping of coastal scientists warning of environmental danger and developers who bring new jobs and tax revenues to the local economy, their districts, and their supporters.  The short sighted decisions are obviously going to lean towards the latter.
<p>We have failed to demonstrate the ability to gaze into the murky environmental future and make any decision as to what our current actions and responsibilities are and should be.  Our national denial of environmental responsibility, which may have be exemplified by Bush’s rejection of the Kyoto Treaty, will likely lead to a situation of an onslaught of caring about our coastlines only after the damage has been done.
<p>Perhaps I am being too cynical.  Despite years of industrial pollutants and dumping of ballast water into the Great Lakes that resulted in one of the largest environmental disasters of the Western hemisphere, we were able to recognize this issue and have moved to address the problem.  Silent Spring and numerous other popular books have brought about a new understanding of the importance of the environment.  The level of ignorance, while still unjustifiably high, is diminishing.  For all it matters, I sit in my apartment in Ames, Iowa, thousands of miles from any coastline, studying human impact on coastlines through a major Midwest university, an unprecedented feat and a step in the right direction.

Yet, I hope that our Government is smart enough to get a handle on the pollution now and hopefully we won't end up with another Black Sea. I would like to believe that environmentalists speaking out, and increasing awareness of the current environmental issues can have an impact on the decisions we make.  Hopefully our need for oil and carelessness will not come in the way of preserving our lakes, oceans, and rivers.  So although we "could" end up with another Black Sea, let's hope we're smart enough to fix the problem or atleast control it while we can.

===subject:A US Black Sea
===message:Unfortunately, the pollution situation that caused the Black Sea disaster could very well be on its way to happening in the Mississippi River delta and the Gulf of Mexico.  As Woodard points out, "The Corn Belt . . . is by far the largest cause of the Dead Zone."  The question for the US is whether we want to continue to have relatively inexpensive consumer food prices as we have had since World War II by continuing to use extremely high rates of nitrogen on our fields and producing massive amounts of crops while their market prices remain extremely low.  This, of course, leads to the massive federal bailout package that farmers have been receiving the past several years.  It also leads to many farmers attempting to gain more farmland.  The more land a farmer owns, the more crop subsidy he/she will receive per year.  There are ups and downs to this environmentally.  The larger the farm operation, the more likely it is that this operation will fall under federal/state/local government scrutiny to ensure that it is complying with environmental regulations.  The disadvantage to this scenario is that the larger the operation, the more opportunity there is to pollute, the more likely to cut corners, and better access to legal defense if violations do occur.  A prime Iowa example of such an occurance is that of the DeKoster hog case of a few years back. <p> 

As Woodard also pointed out, the success of local programs is crucial to the longrun success of any serious attempt to reverse what is happening in the Gulf.  Much of these local efforts would have to take place right here in Iowa and would involve a change in tillage and fertilizer application methods.  It may very well result in a reduced overall crop yield, which would be a very difficult sell for any politician or environmental group.  No farmer is going to readily accept a commidity decrease.  However, if we are to ask the Monsanto's, Shell's, Chevron's, Amoco's, etc. to change their methods, which is the obvious and easy way to look at thing since they are the "giant" polluters, we must be ready to change the way we do things here in the boonie's as well.  Otherwise, before we know it, southern Louisiana will be underwater, the Mississippi delta will be destroyed, and a much greater portion of the Gulf of Mexico will as dead as the Black Sea.

===message:I think that the level of pollution could rise to levels of that in the Black Sea due to agricultural and urban runoff into the sea and of commercial businesses that depend on the oceans water.  But because the area of water in the oceans is a lot larger than that of the Black Sea it probably will not happen in my lifetime.  Also because the pollution at the bottom of the ocean is not so relevant to average beach goers and policy makers, the issue is not an important public issue, though it should be, and this in effect could cause a "solution" to occur to late.

===message:The dead of the Black Sea is attributed largely to rigid leadership in countries that borders it.  This can, but will not happened in the U.S.
It can happen if we continue electing leaders like the ones we have now whom the Kyoto Treaty means nothing to them.
It will not because many people like Colin Woodward and Mr.Steffen Schmidt, just to mention a few, are working hard to raise public awareness on what is happening to the water masses in the U.S.
Regardless of what big businesses do to the Republican leadership, the civil culture among ordinary Americans will prevail and hopefully, we shall choose leaders who care, and this will happen soon than later-evident in the production of electric cars and of course serious steps undertaken by Democratic leadership in Iowa regarding fertilizer spills.

===message:The Black Sea has experienced a quick downfall which caught the nations and stakeholders of that body of water by surprise.  The ability of the Black Sea to be able to take the pollution was miscalculated by so many different groups and the ways the body of water dealt with that pollution was disturbed by many different sources independently.  These different projects and pollution sources all combined at about the same time to endanger the Black Sea and change it beyond its tolerance.  Can this happen here.  I assert, yes it could.  In the United States we have many different interests building and polluting and making plans for projects for power and infrastructure just like the different interest around the Black Sea.  We also share a disregard for what flows down our rivers.  We might be more aware of the problems associated with waist flow, but we are not taking much action to stop it.  We often build “improvements” to river structures and other natural processes that we later find out had a purpose lost forever.   So I believe we too could find a day when everything has snowballed to point that everything dies all at once.

So while I want to say "that's impossiable...we'll never see that here, I take caution before being so sure.  Americans are very well informed of the damage that we are doing to the environment in all aspects, but still it continues.  Many people think it could never get that bad here because our government has a budget "to take care of environmental issues", and rallying groups won't let them not keep our environment safe and clean.  But as I read, watch TV, see with my own eyes, it's already starting to happen here with the Mississippi.  Something must be done, more than what we are already doing, to ensure the damage goes no further.

===subject:Why Should we Care
===message:Our oceans are very important to the whole planet.  First the fish are important for food and beauty and they depend on the entire system of ocean life to survive.  As the books state over and over, if you kill the environment the larger animals and quality of life for everything in the area soon dies as well.  This is the bigger picture we must consider when asking why care about the ocean.  If we kill the ocean we doom ourselves in the process.  We can assume that the ocean will be something we can hide behind a big wall when it is smelly and polluted beyond reason.  It will come back and get us one way or another delivering the very pollution back to the people who sent it there.   This leads us to the very real possibility that we may already be heading down this road and need to rethink what we are doing.  When the species are gone and the water is polluted like the Black Sea our options are not as attractive as they currently are.

Although there certainly is the potential for high levels of pollution and contamination, I have enough faith in representatives and lobbyists that I do not think the situation could get out of control.  It seems that environmental laws are getting touher and regualtions strongly control what gets in our water.  But people in the U.S. are becoming more aware of environmental concerns, thanks to the many non-profit organizations or companies that promote a healthy environment.  While there is substantial pollution in the water, I actually trust that our government would not let it get out of control (like the Black Sea) and enough of a commotion would be able to help the problem.

===subject:The Gulf
===message:According to the book Ocean's End the factors which would lead to a Black Sea type of pollution in the U.S. could occur.  With major nutrients and pollutes being drained into the Gulf through the Mississippi a dead zone has already occurred.  However, I don't believe that the level will ever reach the extremity of the Black Sea.  This is based on two points.  First of all, the Gulf is not landlocked as is the Black Sea, this allows factors to participate in the Gulf region which may actually help to decrease any dead zones, such as storms from the Ocean.  Secondly, although there are many factors from many states and players in the spectrum of this dead zone threat the knowledge of what could happen is growing with evidence from the Black Sea which can be used as an example. With an increase in knowledge and the acceptance of it, the American Black Sea can be prevented.

This however does not address the issue that a Black Sea could well occur.  With the amount of man made pollution that drains into our oceans every year, steming from the corn belt states to the 23 coastal states, if nothing is done it is possible that the dead zone will increase and others will appear along our coast or in our waterways.

===message:Do I think that serious environmental degredation is possible and probable along the U.S. coastline?  Absolutely.  Do I think it will be a clone of the Black Sea fiasco?  Nope.  First, because the Black Sea is a sink for water from Eastern Europe and Central Asia, it was turned into a continental septic tank with nowhere to go. Moreover, the participants in killing off the Black Sea were possibly not even on the sea, just creating wastewater to flow to it.  Like we've seen in the Gulf dead zone generated courtesy of Iowa farmers, contributers who are thousands of miles away happily spray on in oblivion. The difference is that overarching governance connects the Iowa farmers to the Louisiana fishermen, in contrast to Hungarian farmers and Odessa beach bums. (Unless you consider the Warsaw Pact "governance".)  Correct me if I misread, but the Dead Zone is exacerbated seasonally, just a giant continental flush of NPK.  I think what needs to be done is to get farmers to see how much money they are wasting by overapplication of chemicals and see that riparian buffer zones, precision farming, and organic crop production are the way to go. Such motivation would obviously not work in the Soviet-bloc era, but if we could get people to think in terms of their dollars floating down the river, the problem would decrease markedly.  The Dead Zone is serious, but thanks to some geologic dumb luck and somewhat better governance, I don't think the hypoxia problem will be quite the extensive disaster the Black Sea has seen.

As one of the wealthiest nations, we are big consumers.  We are wasteful consumers from oil spills off the coast of Alaska, to over fertilized lawns.  From gigantic cruise ships to naval vessels that dump waste far out at sea.  With every flush of the toilet to every drop of waste left on the beach shore.  Take a walk through the grocery isle and just count the number of household chemicals.  The next time you're out and about take a look around.  How much trash do you see, how much of it will you dispose of properly.  The next time someone says, let's snorkeling or jet skiing, will you pass of the opportunity.  People and the activities we enjoy at the beach always bring with it some sort of wastes.  Yes, there may be more people in the US concerned with the state of our ecosystem, but it's not nearly enough.  Our disregard for the ecology doesn't stop on American soil.  With greater and greater wealth, comes the freedom to travel.  Thus, we help spread blight where ever we go.

Areas like cancer alley have sped up the occurence and size of hypoxia zones. These zones cause a chain reaction that touches every link in the food chain and ecosystem. Small plants and animals that can't get out of these oxygen deprived zones die there. Larger fish that managed to escape to more oxygen rich waters have less food etc. Not enough steps have been taken to prevent and repair the damage done through nitrogen pollution, destruction of wetlands and marshes, corporate pollution etc. the question isn't can it happen in the U.S.- how fast and severely is it taking hold in our waters?

Over several decades, we will begin to see one of two outcomes:  The positive outcome would see a decline in coastal pollution and increased measures of management to prevent invasive species from entering the waters (refer to Prof A. Robertson's information about zebra mussels). The expected negative outcome, however, would see invasive species overrun our coastal shores, similar to that in the Black Sea (even if it takes a century to come to this outcome. <p>
The United States has a history of putting off decisions until either someone else demands an answer or the decision is between life and death.  Although there is continuous research on coastal contamination and invasive species, a major catastrophe would have to occur to REALLY get the government's attention.  It would be more reasonable to hand this job over to the world community where perhaps someone will have more concern for our coasts than we do!

I am not saying we shouldn't do more for the environment though. I believe the US has some good environmental laws. When there is a release of a hazardous material it has to be cleaned up and then depending on the material that has been released that site has to be monitored, and reports have to be sent to the government. Environmental premits have to be issued before you can discharge anything into the waters.( Even domestic water into salt water). Storm drain run off has to be sampled and tested. Industries have environmental compliance audits. All these examples are the reasons I don't think we could have the problems of a lifeless Sea.
