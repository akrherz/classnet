===subject:Discussion #8 Personal Growth
===message:All I can say is wow.  It started from the very moment the two books arrived in the mail.  I have been derelict in my reading for other classes because I simply want to know this material and I can't put the books down.  I am blessed with a childhood on the Texas coast and had the pleasure of several years in Florida too.  I will relocate back to one of them someday - soon.  Maybe I was starved academically for something other than the semi-colon can be used this way, in 600 BCE we think this happened, and even though we can't show or explain it to you, this is what happens in this tissues of your body.  Yes, okay, fine, I am a man capable of strong faith and I can buy into all of the above just dandy, but this course becomes very personal, very quickly, and we can see, feel, and taste it if we want to.  All of us have been on or at least seen a beach, even if only in a photograph.  All of us have knowledge of seaside development, hurricanes, fish, reefs, oceans, rivers, and floodplains.  I just can't get the thought out of my head as to how simply ignorant I was to what was going on before my eyes.  I have to admit, I am disappointed in myself for not having understood some of this before.  I was living in quiet "blindness" to what was happening around me.  I proposed to my wife on top of the Galveston Seawall!  So many fishing trips have centered around jetties in several states!  I have been on many a rock groin in Texas!  I have driven down Highway 87 between High Island and Sabine Pass, Texas, complaining the State had not rebuilt the tiny little two-lane highway after the last tropical storm and the potholes and "new" sand dunes ON the highway were a pain!  I've written in other discussions how disheartening it is to be returning from a day offshore as we enter the inlet, or pass, or jetty system coming inshore, how we long to see an uninterrupted space of natural coastline.  But instead, we are greeted with hi-rise buildings, armor, and the ever-present floating trash that mankind leaves behind which accumulate in the quiet flow of our harbors.  Never again will I be so naive, the innocence is dead.  As I've grown older I have become an outspoken supporter of responsible wildlife management.  On my boat we will not kill a fish unless it is hooked severely and is likely to die if released, or unless someone guarantees me they will consume the fish.  Even at that, the mentality can still exist that, "We paid you Captain for this trip and we will keep anything and everything we choose," then I respectfully inform them it is my vessel and we can return to shore and let them get about their day.  We let it be known the resource is exhaustable and we encourage and only tolerate the responsible harvest and use of fish.  There have been those we sadly [but gladly] had to take to shore.  We all have to muster this same level of respect for our environment and this extends beyond the beachfront.  We cannot limit our concern to one aspect of our ecology.  We need true leaders willing to take the heat of unpopularity and they need true supporters letting them know their efforts are appreciated.  My circle of friends already call me, the man of conscience when it comes to hunting and fishing, now I guess they can add one more cause to my list as well.  One of my dearest and best friends is an environmental engineer (air quality) in Florida.  We have already had the argument, uh, debate, on jetties and groins.  He conceded the downdrift side always, ALWAYS, expresses erosion but he never thought about the reasons why, only that they were great fishing spots!  The way to pass this education along is to be able to intellectually communicate the implications of our past mistakes and the future problems of continuing our development and armorment.  Society may respond to those they can respect.  Well-informed, tactful, and educated speakers can do this cause a great deal of good.  I hope to contribute within my group of peers, I know my friends who live on the coast are tiring of me, including my brother and his riprapped shoreline behind his home!  In terms of academics, if I ultimately choose not to attend law school I have considered teaching environmental studies and ethics.  I need more courses on coastal management Professor Schmidt, what's next?  If my intended course remains true, four years from now I will be a practicing attorney with a primary focus on maritime and coastal ecology issues.  I have found that Florida State, University of Miami, University of Florida, Tulane, and the University of Houston all have exceeding in-depth law studies on ocean and coastal use.  I have to find the money for out-of-state tuition and living expenses, but these universities seem to have the prominent law programs that focus in these areas.  I am looking forward to this level of my education with great anticipation.  Finally, the one thing I have learned more so than any other, is that I can be staring at a problem and not even see it!  This has been an eye-opening experience from the start of the first chapter.  I have grown personally from this course and have found an even deeper respect for the power and wisdom of mother nature and the value of our coastal zones.  Thank you.  Capt. Dave

 When I was approached by Mike about this class in the Spring I was kinda puzzled. What was this going to be? SOme kind of government programs class, maybe exchange of cool personal videos shot somewhere in the coast, including Spring Break girls gone crazy! But I was wrong, sort of, I have learn about government programs that have killed beaches, and others that are helping save them. I have learn, to my enrae that I am paying for Madonna, Gloria Steffan, and others's homes in Miami. Maybe i should stop by for some cafecito! 
<p> The knowledge gained has not only been on national issues, but in worldwide locations. I was so amazed of the Black Sea's condition that it sent chills up, and down my spine to know that something similar it's happenning in the Gulf. I disagreed with C. Dean more than I did with C. Woodward, I truly like his style, and points of view. C. Dean seemed to me a little intransigent when it came to aknowledge that soem of the damage's source is simply unknown, or nature related. 
<p> The videos were there, but no bikini-stripped chicks, instead Dr. Aqualong. They (videos) were very informative as seeing is believing. They weren't very long, except #4, and still they helped to envision the subject of discussion, and readings. I specially loved the video shot at Fort Lauderdale with the humongous hotel right by the water. Spoke louder than a 1000 words! I am really thankfull that I decided to pursue this class, maybe i can T.A. the next time, and I can suffer the jet lag to go shoot at Ibiza? Would you think about it Dr. Fjord?

===message:The most interesting thing that really hit me hard was about the Marshall Islands being totally wiped from this planet with raising a sea level.  In a lot of my classes they remind us that the sea level is rising and we know, and its not that big of a deal.  But for some reason that chapter in Oceans End, really got to me.  After I read that chapter and was thinking about it, I couldn’t believe that homes and childhood memories could never be revisited again if the sea levels rise.  For some reason that chapter made me think about how I would feel if my homeland was never going to be there again. <p> I think that this would contribute to my personal life by being appreciative that I still have and probably always will have my home where I grew up to visit.  This chapter also made me more intelligent about the social factors that come with such drastic changes in our physical environment.  A lot of times I think all about what natural disasters that are being produced from human pollution, but this time I am thinking more about less wealthy countries and their future.  And this issue has contributed to my professional development by being more conscious of other non-obvious consequences that come with bad situations.  All of these contributions to my life I owe to that one chapter about the Marshall Islands.

Before this class I had no idea of how beaches came to be or their interaction with humans.  It has been an eye-opening and intellectually embarrassing endeavor.  I guess I've always been environmetally conscious but not environmentally aware.  That is, I thought about the environment; although, I never really learned about it.  Consequently, It's shown me the necessity of reading everything I can get my hands on.  This class has made realize how much I don't read about other areas that may be only remotely connected to me.

What I've never had to do is figure out what to do about it. Being a scientist is kinda comfortable that way. Just the facts and then argue over interpretations - a glorious intellectual exercise. Trying to figure out what to do is a whole 'nother ballgame. This has given me a greater appreciation of how we really do formulate policies and that science is a bit remis in not seeing that all citizens know the basic facts upon which to base sound policies. Most of us just talk to one another. Some should be writing children's story books and films ...

===message:I think the most interesting thing I've learned and applied to my educational background is the entire arena of "coastal ignorance". One of the very first things I discussed on classnet was the lack of understanding I have in this area of coastal policies and issues. I had never been exposed to the topic, and I am dumbfounded by the lack of media attention and even political attention these issues get, because they are extremely important and vital to our the future of our nation, which is something we should be concerned about. The concept of global warming was not something new to me because I had taken courses in environmental science before, but the concept of beach erosion and the potential danger in cities such as New Orleans was entirely new to me. One of the most interesting topics was the discussion of the Atlantic Cod. I thought the material on how quickly they were depleted was very interesting and frightening at the same time! It has opened my eyes to an entirely new area of thinking, and I will pay more respect to these issues in the future.

===message:  Personally, the most interesting thing I read in this class was the chapter on the muddy waters of the Mississippi.  I'm living in Memphis for the summer and have a wonderful view of the river from my balcony.  Imagine my surprise as I sat on my balcony reading about all the sewage, petrochemical waste, and other stuff that was pumping through its waters.  I kayaked there last weekend, and now I wonder if the fish that jumped in my kayak really did have a third eye....  I've lived in St Louis for almost half of my life time, so you would think this all would come to no surprise to me, but it really hit hard this time.  Now I wonder when I flush stuff down the drain whether I'm sending it straight in the Mississippi and adding to the problem.  
<br>
As for my professional career, I'm very interested in the general public's perspective of the biological sciences.  Going into genetics, I can see that accurate information to the public will be essential to make advances in these fields as well.  As one of the authors of a book I'm reading referred to it... science often takes the approach of running something over with a bulldozer and then measuring the tracks it left behind.

Wow... seeing as I have learned so much in such a short period of time, it's hard to pick out one thing that I have learned so far... I would just like to say first that I had no idea how naive I was when it came to some of the problems we are faced with along our coastal areas. I had no idea that the Black Sea was in as much trouble as it is and more suprisingly I was shocked to find out that the same type of problem could be happening in the "dead zone" at the end of the Mississippi! All of the various areas that I have been shown in Ocean's End has been very good. I think that there is no better way to learn than by closely examining our past and that book does a good job of it. 

So overall I would say that the one thing that has really hit me was all the information regarding the Mississippi and how people even all the way up in Iowa can really affect the coast.

===message:   They say learning is a life time experience. Being both a concerned citizen and an advid enviromentalist I was under the "impression" I was aware of most if not all of the world's ecoology problems.  However, until I experienced this course I had no idea the oceans, of the world, were in such trouble.  Granted I have yet to take a course from Dr. Schmidt that I did not gain both a world of knowledge with great teaching, and  personal insight, but coastal policies is the first educational experience that has made me want to somehow try and make a difference. 
   Being a "non traditional" student returning to college to finish my degree I was amazed at the overwhelming committment and concern "traditional" students had regarding the issues of today, misguided in some respects but a committment nevertheless. 
   Just imagine what would happen if "all" students everywhere were to take up the problem of ocean pollution.  The consequence of thousands of young people asking in some cases demanding their government become involved in saving the oceans would cause a cataclysm of bibilical propotion, well maybe not that large but huge.  Coastal policies is certainly a course that should be required for anyone living either on or near the coast.  Because of circumstances involving midwest pollution of the Gulf this course should in all probabilty be mandatory of high school seniors everywhere or college freshmen.  One needs to be aware of a problem before they can fix the problem.  My own personal insight and academic growth have certainly benefited from this educational experience, and hopefully I "can" make a difference.

===message:The most interesting thing that I have learned so far in our Coastal Policy class probably would have to be the alarming beach erosion trend.  I love beaches and water so this is particularly disturbing to me.  I am from Iowa and the only time that I have visited a coastal area is when I went to Negril, Jamaica and even in that underdeveloped environment I could certainly imagine the harmful effects the tourist industry has on that beautiful, seven mile beach.  I think that as human beings we always feel that we can put our heads together and find a way to fix things without changing anything that we are doing to boost tourism or basically to make money.  This particulary problem though seems unable to be solved by man and is better left to nature which is something that most corporations, industries and other money making devices don't exactly understand.

I'd been to an aquarium, where I saw the animals that live off the NC coast, and I'd been to a couple beaches there as well.  Places like Miami Beach I've only seen on tv, and had never given a thought to the effects of building up the coastal areas as much as they have there.  I didn't know anything about seawalls and groins and the like, and their effects.  I had heard of beach renourishment, but I had no idea places regularly truck in sand from other areas to recreate their beaches.  This class has reminded that me that, even though I think I'm a well-informed, well-educated person and an environmentalist, there are so many issues that I just don't know about or understand.  This class had made me want to learn more about coastal issues, and reminded me that, even though I don't live anywhere near the coast, its health and well-being should be of concern to everyone.

This class has hit directly and indirectly on a lot that I am interested in.  I have always been interested in policy, land/water use, planning, and the environment.  Something that really sparked my interest was the chapter in "Ocean's End" about the management of the Mississippi River and how it has had an impact on the Gulf of Mexico.  I knew but I didn't know how much impact activity as far away as Denver, Minneapolis, or even little Ottumwa, Iowa (my hometown) has on life in Lousiana and the Gulf of Mexico.  For some reason that topic and the information in that one chapter really sparked an interest.  I have now spent the last couple of days trying to figure out where I could go to get involved in that kind of problem solving and management field, which now has led me to reading through all of the Army Corps of Engineers web-site and the Department of Interior's web-site specifically the Bureau of Land Management.

I also found much useful information in Against the Tide. The littoral drift was an interesting concept to me.

===message:I must say that I've learned a LOT in this class about different coastal issues, both environmental, and economic.<p>

I am hard pressed to say what the single most interesting thing I've learned was, but it has been a great eye-opening experience for me. Before this class, I really had no idea about the complexities of both the political and ecological issues surrounding our coasts and oceans.<p>

I have been raised "landlocked" my entire life, and have yet to see an ocean, although I have been to Padre Island once several years ago. About the only wildlife I remember seeing was tons of jellyfish washed up on the shores at that time (it was during mid-December, I believe).<p>

Because of not being otherwise familiar with coastal areas or wildlife, I have learned tons of very interesting information in this class, everything from proper (and not so proper) ways to manage the coastlines to prevent erosion and what are some good policies to minimize hurricane damage to coastal cities.<p>

Also, much has been learned, from the second book we were assigned to read, about proper management of coastal fish stocks and deep-ocean and remote ecosystems, such as Antarctica. It is vital to understand the impacts that our human habits for the way we use our coastal lands and watersheds have on the fish we eat, and the food chain they eat, all the way down to the tiniest microorganism.<p>

Overall, this class has enhanced my understand of issues that will hopefully be beneficial someday, perhaps in second-hand education of my peers.

===message:<p>Delving my thoughts into ideas regarding technology, economics, and society, I have largely viewed environmental issues as a passive observer.  Other people were the scientist; they knew all and determined our environmental future.  Ha!  What an ignorant view!  One of the strongest, reoccurring issues within all of the ready is the ineptitude of policy makers to collaborate with science in determining our future.  It seems that the scale has been overwhelmingly tipped towards economic, not ecological, prosperity.

<p>For the most part, blame can be directed at the inability of <I>anyone</I> to make a sound decision with regards to the long-run well being of our planet.  Politicians have largely favored tax revenues over costal reserves.  Fisherman, beachgoers (homeowners and tourists alike), and developers have seemingly ignored the fragility of our costal resources.  Scientists have even been largely distorted in their views of the ocean.  The eye of innovation did not focus on costal research until well after the alteration of waterways for industrial interests had permanently altered our environment.  Tisk, tisk to all of us for our staring at our feet as we walk into the wall.

<p>Having lived on both coasts in which I acquired not only knowledge regarding costal issues but a fascination with the ocean, this class has offered me an ability to gain new insights into the issues at hand.  While I often knew of the problems surrounding sea walls and other artificial barriers (thanks to endless rants from an aunt and uncle presiding on the Outer Banks), I was not aware of many of the problems facing Gulf States as a result of excessive pollution and human alterations.  Most shocking to me was the rather direct disturbance of the Mississippi River, a body I have always thought as invincible.

The text book selection has a great deal to do with that, as both books are extremely informative, yet the information is presented in such a matter-of-fact easy-to-read was that I found it very difficult to put the books down.  <p>

As others have said, I had no idea the enormous effects that Iowa farmers and the like have on the Mississippi delta and the Gulf.  The statistic of a quarter million tons of nitrates a year from Iowa ALONE flowing to the Gulf is staggering.  <p>

I also was naive to the astronomical amount of money that has been spent and continues to be spent on coastal armor.  I was at Miami Beach in December, and believe me, this course has forced me to look at it in a whole new light.  <p>

I was also very pleased to learn who the established "coastal defenders" are in the nation.  I checked out Orrin Pilkey's website at Duke and consequently have read a number of his recent articles and have checked out a couple of his books.  He truly is an expert in his field.  As I am presently applying to grad and law schools, this course has really helped me to narrow my desired field of study.  I have known for the past few years that I have wanted to be involved in environmental policy or in some regard, but I now know that coastal policy is definitely a field I would like to explore more thoroughly in the future.  <p>

I never thought about the depriciation of beaches and shorelines until I took this class. I grew up in Chicago near Lake Michigan and I was a frequent visitor to the beaches. It never occured to me about how the beach was maintained with rocks and concrete barriers and how this will cause the beach to decrease in size.

I also am very aware of the nature of hurricanes,the catergories that they are labeled and the most expensive and the worst destructions caused by them. Learning how insurances companies fight policies and premiums with people who live in high risk areas was another factor that was compelling to me, because individuals are willing to take a the risk of loosing their lives,property, and homes for the great view and weather living next to an ocean.


I thought it was ironic that the greatest natural disater occured nearly 100 years ago in the month of September. Just shows you that September 11 is not the only September disaster we should remember.


I enjoyed the peice on CNN about hurricanes and sodium iodine in the air to try control storms.  I also believe that more homes and building should be built for hurricane destruction. Buildings and homes should have solid steel basements for protection, so people could ride out the storm instead of "jamming" the freeways in a panic. The Dead Black Sea was of most interest because of pollutants,toxin, and waste that cause these problems and the inability of internationl governments not cooperating with each other to solve this problem.

I would hate to see this happen to one of our great lakes or beautiful oceans. But as an informed person about such things, I would try to be aware of legislature agendas concerning our lakes,seas, and oceans. 

Invasive species are a real threat to the enviorment and more publicity needs to be address to the public so we can pressure local,national, and internationl government to change or impliment new policies.


This was a very interesting class,that I am glad that I took and, I am more inform about coastal managment policies,jetties,high risk areas, hurricane destruction,dead seas,and the importance of the ocean to our daily existence.

I think knowing how building on the coasts  affects our beaches, has changed how I think.  I always wanted to get a house right on the beach when I got older, but now I have a lot to consider.  Not only should I take into account hurricanes and the safety of my home, but also what damage I will cause by building on the beach and how that can increase beach erosion.  Also, I can't look at beaches the same way.  When I see a beach I now think of the damage done to the beach and notice things like a lack of beach and sea walls that are built.  I think all of what I've learned will be useful to me in the future.  I may one day be a part of our government or a project that will concern our beaches or oceans.  I think now that I know what problems can affect them (such as chemical pollution, man made sea walls, groins, invasive species, etc...) I can make better decisions and perhaps make a difference.  I truly believe the uneducated are ruining our beaches and oceans and thus our futures, and I'm glad I am no longer catagorized in that group.

===subject:What I have learned
===message:I think that Ocean's End really opened my eyes to the global importance of protecting the oceans and coasts.  Before reading the book, I had no idea that so many species and so many habitats were being destroyed by such a multitude of human errors.  I had never heard of so many fisheries becoming barren, or had any idea of how vast the destruction of the world's coral reefs was.<BR>
After reading this book, I feel that at some point in my life (when I can afford it) I must contribute in some way to saving the oceans.  Whether it be through monetary donations or through a political/lobbying venue, myself and everyone should fight to keep the oceans safe for future generations.

===subject:what I liked most
===message:I found both books to be very fun to read, I found out a good deal of history in both which really amazed me.  I think the most profound concept I gathered was just how very mobile the beaches really are.  I knew they moved and eroded but the frequency of movement and devastation of some of the coastal barrier islands of the east coast during storms was very eye opening.  Having visited a few of those places recently it seems like the shore is stable and will be right where it is forever, but seeing the pictures in the books and reading the accounts really bring to light just how unstable that region is.

===subject:What I have learned
===message:As I have said before, this class presented all new material to me and I never knew of the problems that existed.  The most interesting thing to me has been the issue of beach erosion and armor that is used for (trying to) fix the problem.  I find it interesting that there are so many things that can go wrong and are almost guaranteed to go wrong that development continues.  It is almost as if people COMPLETELY disregard the problems that have occurred in the past and act as if the problems have been fixed by now and will not affect them.  Personally, if I were developing property I would stay completely away from coastal areas.  Rising sea levels, continually eroding coasts, greenhouse effects, lack of effective armor- all of these aspects see so obvious that I wonder why developmnet continues along the coast.<br><br>
I know that it is not realistic to think that we cannot put homes and business opportunities along the coast and beaches, but why do people continue to build there?  And almost as important, why do others allow development so close to the shore?  Although much of the material presented has focused on one side of the argument and I have not read much of the contrary, I just do not understand why people keep fighting nature and think they can get around its natural processes.<br><br>
People on the beaches can continues to try and armor them but I wonder why they keep trying to fight the ocean.  Much of the armor put up seems to be such a temporary solution and will almost always lead to another problem down the road, either on the shore they tried to fix or another shore downdrift.  But then again, it would be very difficult to just stop development and keep moving inland as the waves push beaches inland.  The coastland is so nice that it provides a desirable place to retreat.  But when there is no more beach, then what (where is the easy solution???)  Because there is no easy solution, it appears that they will keep fighting nature but the ocean will always have the upper hand.

===subject:Coastal Development
===message:All of the information which I have learned through this class has been completely new to me.  I think some of the most interesting to me was in Against the Tide, I never new how groins and jetties and different man made beach armor affected the coasts.  I also didn't know that beach front property was so "developmentally abused" by real estate and commercial types (there's the iowa naivity shinning through).  In the second book, I really enjoyed the info about the Mississippi, mainly because it answered many lingering question which book one had left in my mind about the sediment from the inland sources and how the inner states effect the coastal states, along with dams as well.

===message:As far as contributing to my professional, academic, etc. development I know this knowledge will be applicable when I go to the east coast in a month for a convention/vacation and will visit and travel from Boston to Washington D.C.  I don't think I would have appreciated or even noticed many of the factors of the coast which I know I will now that I have taken this class.  
<pr>
Also, as far as professional.  I am a political Science major and my main area of interest is in Asia and China.  The information which I have acquired through this class will come in handy when studying these areas as most of their major cities and populations hubs are on the coasts.  Also with the development of the Three Gorges Dam in China on the Yangtze and the effects which will result from that in terms of political, environmental, and economical will be of great intrest to me and I know I will be able to better interpret information about these types of developments and the possible outcomes because of this class.

===message:Well I have learned a lot of things by participating in this class. I am a political Science major and I am looking at going into the FBI or CIA so I wont be doing a lot with coastal areas. Some day I might live near the coast so its great know all the new things I know now. I don’t have the wish to go into politics now but maybe so day I will and because of this class I know coastal areas are a huge issue and not just in the U.S. but even in Europe. I think that is the most interesting topic in my mind. The policy or lack there of in such a “highly developed” area such as Europe; where they look down on the U.S. because we still use the death penalty but they don’t take care of there environment.

===subject:The Depth of it All
===message:Throughout my education, my entire life I have heard about how much man has destroyed the world.  With most environmental issues it begins with man's mistakes in the past and how our generations are paying the price and are charged with correcting the mistakes.  After hearing story after story, whether it be the once fertile Iowa Soil, the Everglades in Florida, or the fresh water supply throughout the world, man is blamed, generally rightfully so.  But all the arguments start to blend together until the point when we feel helpless and overburden.

However this class, both the texts and lectures, have taken a slightly different approach.  The texts took the time to illustrate some of the positives man has implemented in terms of the environment.  The design of Seaside, Florida can be a good basis for future developments.  Options are given in the texts for ways to solve the problems, refreshing considering some of the arguments heard in the past which simply talk about the problems and no solutions.  

The texts do a good job of sounding some alarms.  They are infomative, well written and illustrate their points well.  While its safe to say we were all aware of marine pollution problems, none of us had any idea it was to such a high degree.  Basically the books opened my eyes and more importantly presented possible solutions and courses of action.

===subject:Economics vs Environment
===message:Through a lot of the case studies that we've been exposed to a recurring problem seems to be popping up. A lot of environmental disasters and tragedies are happening for the sake of profit maximization and the inreased wealth of a few countries, possibly not even the country sacrificing its environmental quality. This eraly complicates issues becaue the biggest threats to environmental progress and sustainable living are those who make the msot profit from bad practices. They also have a lot of clout with governmetn officials because of their size or corporate status. a lot of the financial interests mentioned have lobbyists and persistent individuals speaking out for their sake. Who represeants the environment? Especialy areas like the ocean that don't fall under any one international jurisdiciton and are kind of community/global property. Research directed to cleaner fuels and moe sustainable living practices are something more governmetns should subsidize instead of an inefficient, environmentally hazardous fishing industry.

===subject:What I have learned 
===message:The best thing that I have learned so far from this class is that the best way to stop the erosion and the destruction of the coasts is to stop ourselves from trying to do something about it and to stop destroying by our own negligence.  As the readings have shown humans are the main reason that the beaches and coasts are struggling to survive to this day.  What I didn't know until now is the best way to stop beach erosion and to keep the coast fresh and new is to just let nature take it's course on the beaches and coast.  Humans have always been the cause of the problems of the coast.  We as the future generation need to stop this and let the coast heal on its own.

===message:I must say that I really enjoyed all off Colin Woodard's book.  Every chapter took the reader to a new part of the world, most of which I am sure I will never visit.  The most fascinating section of the book (at least to me) was the part on Antartica.  It's amazing how a place inhabitated with an incredibly small number of people is also the place where the effects of pollution are best seen.  It was also interesting to read about how quickly and completely the landscape there can change.    At this time in my life I am unclear as to what I will be doing in the future, law school is the only set plan.  However, since I will be attending school in Oregon, who knows, maybe someday I will help in the fight for our countries beaches.

===message:The most interesting thing I have learned so far would be about hurricanes, the affects they have on coastal communites, and how much damage they can do.  I never really got interested in the news growing up and this was pretty eye-opening to learn of the damages that several hurricanes have done over the years, having caused millions of dollars of damage, causing so many deathes, and even wiping out entire islands, it's pretty interesting to learn of the destructive power mother nature has on the world.

===message:the most interesting thing that i have learned so far has come from Ocean's End.  Before reading this book i was unaware of all the places in the world that are affected by pollution.  this is really a worldwide problem.  For example, the section on the fishing industry in Newfoundland really hit close to home.  <p>
I have talked to many lobstermen off the coast of Maine and i wonder if someday they will face the same fate as the fishermen in Newfoundland.  I respect their work more than i do a corporate executive.  Try making decisions in wind, waves and icy water, as opposed to a cushy chair and air conditioning.  <p>
Outward Bound will soon open up a new course are in Newfoundland.  I am anxious to work there because i now have a more solid foundation for the history of the area.  I already teach Leave No Trace principles and the students will definitely get a little coastal policy lesson along with it.

===message:I have learned how much science has discovered but how far we still have to go.  People are learning and understanding the importance of our waters and coastal areas but we still have a long way to go.  I have traveled to many beautiful beaches around the world.  I look at them differently now, with more concern.  In foreign countries I see the huge challange that lyes ahead in trying to educate their people about the importance of the coast.  I have always been the one who goes with others to fish but instead ends up spending the majority of the time picking up trash.  Now maybe I have a little more knowledge under my belt to try to get others to understand why we should take care of our waters.

===message:I have learned from the readings about what the world's population, past and present, is doing to the worlds biological system.  The most interesting thing I have learned is from Colin Woodard' book Ocean's End, and how he describes the coast along the Romanian side of the Black Sea, for example swimming into a "slick of brown-tinged scum."  Before this book I never realized the extent of our actions on our environment and from the descriptions of the author, I have a better understanding of what is happening to the environments around the world.  From these readings, I will be able to make better informed decisions about the environment when talking or working with someone who's actions will have an adverse effect on my surroundings.

===message:I have found the problems with armoring the most interesting to me. I see the jetties, piers, sheetpile,etc. all the time but never knew the problems the armoring has caused. Once I started this course I started paying more attention to the sand on the beach and could really see how one side of the jetty is starved of sand compaired to the other. It made me think how un-educated the general public is an the coastal areas and the problems associated with minipulation of the natural cycle of the beach. All the public beaches around me have big signs and fences to "Keep Off The Dunes" but the same people that are protecting the dunes have larger jetties built to keep the beach in place. I feel all the people that are making the decisions on the coastal issues should have to take this course.
