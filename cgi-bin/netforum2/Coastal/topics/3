===more:<br><b>(NOTE: If you want line breaks in these postings put a "<" with the letters "br" (for break)and the symbol ">" to after that in your text. If you want a full paragraph break put the letter "p" between the same symbols.)</b> This is some html command so it could come in handy!

Now that you have read the case Risky Insurance (http://www.public.iastate.edu/~sws/freeunit2.htm) please answer the question - <b>"If you build on the coast, with all the risks that are implied, who should bear the cost of insurance?" </b><p>
Remember that the same question can be asked about people building in flood plains, people who engage in occupations such as farming, and other areas of life where insurance and risk protection are important.
