===subject:Discussion #6 The Oceans, Who Needs 'Em!?
===message:I have to approach this with as much common sense as I can muster because I do not have the academic, technical, or scientific background as some of you.  I am just a salty old sea captain who errantly landed in Iowa after deciding to visit family for a few months.  To me, the oceans represent a gauge of what is happening in our total environment.  In Ocean's End, Woodard writes in Chapter Two, "Oceans cover 71% of our planets surface and are clearly its most dominant feature."  I may be the most basic form of human life (male), but when 71% of something shows signs of decay, it should be a warning signal.  When other species can no longer survive changing sea conditions then we must recognize these changes as potential threats to us as well.  The world around us is doing its best to tell us how it is responding to current conditions.  For so long, we have errantly lived thinking we could not run the ocean out of fish and no matter our use the ocean could absorb and dilute all that what we gave her.  Much like the 1800's gave us immense industrial advances, the 1900's gave us technology never before seen, and as we head off into the 2000's we need to recognize the impact of an increasing global population.  Let's hope the 21st century continues our progress of improving world standards of living, while at the same time, protecting the remaining natural gifts around us.  We should do our part to focus on the very water and soil that sustain us.  We are each responsible for the outcome.  We have studied coastal damage and erosion, though disheartening and upsetting, these are not likely to be an endangerment to overall human survival.  But in Ocean's End we are shown the results of our actions on life itself.  It teaches us resources are finite and we must exercise self-restraint.  Global warming, melting glaciers, rising water levels, higher temperatures, increased salinity in freshwater areas, dying reefs, species depletion, and destruction of our estuaries has led to increased pollution levels hugging our shoreline in the Gulf.  As a fisherman, the stories of the North Atlantic Cod, the Bluefin Tuna, the Southern Redfish, and the Swordfish are very depressing.  Conservation efforts are helping re-establish some of these, such as the redfish and speckled trout along the Gulf Coast, striped bass of the Chesapeake, and catch and release are heard resoundingly throughout the sportfishing ranks.  Commercial fishing fleets can do great damage, but does this damage stem from making money or does it come from the effort to feed the world?  But why do we have to deplete fish stocks to a level that requires artificial breeding and stocking programs or moratoriums on harvests?  The answer is there is a demand for them and we have learned nature is very resilient, but only if left alone.  The whitetail deer, turkey, grizzly bear, and elk are some of the tremendous success stories of American conservation.  We know if given a chance, without further habitat degradation and overharvest, species will bounce back.  Much like the Coelacanths once thought to be extinct, now we know they have at least a small surviving population.  When the pressure on them decreased, they stabilized to their remaining habitat and have sat there unmolested, until we found them again.  Sadly, it appears we still cannot leave them alone, we simply are too smart for "their" own good.  Scientists, aquariums, and museums all want specimens.  I would think the first thing they would want is to have a healthy population and would do what they could to dissuade any harvest of these ancient fish.  Should they be wanted or studied, they should be viewed in their natural habitat.  Maybe, the value of species such as the Coelacanth is less than that of human pride and arrogance.  As long as people are willing to kill because they believe something such as spinal fluid from a nearly extinct fish may be the secret to everlasting life, we are in trouble as a species ourself.  Without question, we must be aware of the changes to our oceans.  If we could get 71% of the voting public to an election, we would be dancing in the streets that Americans once again participated in the process.  If 71% of our global mass [and it's the area that is least directly touched by human hands] says we aren't feeling well, we need to visit the doctor and pay real close attention.  Capt. Dave

Iowa’s hog lot run-off issue is then not a local issue, nor a state issue, not a regional one, not even a national issue but a world issue because hog lot run-off knows no boundaries.

===subject:Do we need oceans?
===message:Do we really need the oceans?  You better believe we do.  Anything that has amassed to cover over 71% of the earth's surface deserves, in fact demands, our respect and admiration.  The ocean's play a critical role in our daily lives rather we live within a few short miles from the shore or hundreds of miles inland.  Ever hear of El Nino?  This ocean phenomen has created changes in the world's weather pattern to the extent it is now forecasted and watched closely by governments of all nations.  In the past decade El Nino has had a devasting effect on many parts of the world.  From floods to drought this change in the ocean's pattern has done irreparable damage to many facets of our lives.  Some countries in Latin America suffered such terrible losses due to flooding it will take decads to recover, if they recover at all.  The continent of Africa has for several years now been in the grasp of a terrible drought.  Many scientists feel this is due to the lasting effect of El Nino and a permanent change in the earth's weather patterns.  Many experts believe, as I do, the earth's weather as a whole is dependent on the ocean's currents as well as it's temperatures.  Could these changes be due to our polluting the rivers and tributary's?  Let's face it the streams, rivers, lakes and oceans are not the same way we found them, unless of course the Black sea was born of pollution and void of fish.  Humans have got to learn that the oceans are not a dumping ground. As men persist in their will to superseed mother nature and do what they want, greed, they destroy the very essence of life.  We have read what becomes of nations who depended on the oceans for their subistense and then raped it of that substance only to leave a watery grave devoid of any sutible existence. Is the Black sea going to be the forwarner of what is in store for us or will we use it as an examination of how not to proceed toward our oceans?  Only time will tell, because we do indeed need the oceans.

===message:I think this is a very interesting question to ask because when I first saw it I really wondered if I would even think about this question if I was not enrolled in this course... has anyone outside this field really ever sat down and brainstormed reasons on their own agenda about why we need the oceans??? I would argue that a vast majority have not. I think one of the big reasons we need to care about the ocean is because,as mentioned it covers around 71% of the Earth's surface, and with global warming posing a possible threat to the ice in Antartica, that percentage could rise. As mentioned in the book and on many environmentalist's agendas, if the ice melts and goes into the ocean it could put sea levels high enough to flood major coastal cities, such as New Orleans. This possible outcome really bothers me, but many of us have not even discovered this knowledge and as both readings have illustrated, with coastal policies we do not really think about the "long term" solutions. Plus are oceans are a major source of drilling for oil-I know many in this course probably shutter when they see this, but they are beneficial to our energy needs, depending on the side of the spectrum you are on. And the fishing industry is a major market for most coastal areas. Look at how the decline of the Atlantic Cod destroyed Newfoundland... this could happen everywhere with our recent strategies of "over-fishing". I think our oceans are vital to our everyday needs, but many of us fail to acknowledge this.

===subject:We should Care 
===message:We should care about the water temperature and the quality of water in the ocean.  The ocean is a vital area for life beyond fish.  There are a lot of mammals and other animals that live in the ocean.  Thus when the quality of water and temperature change in the ocean's water then these animals would be harmed or maybe killed.  History has proven that when humans tamper with an environment and do not do anything about it, worst things happen.  If nothing happens now or people still don't care then these animals and living creatures will die, just because they can't conform to the new quality or temperature of water.  So when that happens you can bet that the ocean will be a great place for the extinction of life in water.

===subject:why?
===message:While the previous answers have made several valid points, I figured I’d try to stick with my own expertise for my reasons why we should (of course) care for the ocean and it inhabitants.  
<br>
Ever thought of how amazingly diverse the life on Earth is?  As a geneticist, this seems like a strong impetus for protecting the oceanic ecosystem.  Woodard mentions the cod off the shore of Newfoundland that were able to adapt to both temperature extremes when their population was large enough, but when the population was selectively diminished, it could not longer adapt with the same flexibility.  Coral reefs are mentioned several times in the text as in serious danger.  They are some of the most biologically diverse regions of the planet.  Just as we have discovered cures for diseases in rainforests we’ve almost decimated, we will regret damaging these bastions of diversity (and I’ll be severely disappointed as a diver…).  
<br>
Other biological impetuses for protecting the watery worlds around us include the protection that coral reefs provide coastlines.  In Australia, the Great Barrier Reef is being hurt by runoff, rising sea levels, and other anthropogenic causes.  Without its protection, coastlines that have always been protected from destructive waves will be left defenseless.  
<br>
While species will constantly go extinct with or without human help, actions we take to increase the speed will not allow the species that should replace them to develop either.  This may leave us in a lurch when disaster strikes because with diminished diversity comes less adaptability to harsh conditions.

===message:We should be interested in the quality of water, temperature of the water and life of the oceans because we depend on them!  Who cares, right?  No way, we all need to care.
Since I am in Massachusetts now, I left this awesome stat sheet at home listing numerous reasons how we as humans depend on the ocean.  I will try to retrieve them from my brain and share them with you all.  <p> A statistic that says something like, 1in 4 Americans are directly connected to the ocean by their occupation.  That’s huge!  Just think if the ocean was in really bad shape look how many people would be out of a job or drastically hurt by this condition.  <p> One of my favorite facts is that most of the oxygen we breath  comes from the ocean.  The little phytoplankton and macro algae found in the photic zone of the ocean undergoes so much photosynthesis that when it releases its by product and it cumulates we end up with a lot of O2! We need that to breath, and to live, etc.  We depend on the ocean to produce a lot of oxygen so we can survive.  If the quality of the water, temperature and life of the ocean is no longer in excellent condition, then we will be affected by this tremendously.  <p> I think another good point that deals more with the social point of the ocean has to do with the chapter about the Marshall Islands.  We need to care about the temperature of the ocean because cultures and peoples native land could be wiped off this planet.  If the ocean level raises then a lot of people will no longer have a place to call home.  How sad is that?  We need to care for ourselves but also for each other.

It is easier for many of us to have no opinion or not acknowlegde the problems that we are causing and enhancing.  However, it seems that the question of why ocean water is important should not be overlooked so easily.  We already know that if water temperature continues to rise at the rate it is now, soon states like Florida, Louisiana, and the numerous barrier islands will all be history.  We should also care more for quality after seeing what happened to the Black sea, and realizing that it is happening in the Gulf right now.

===message:The quality of the oceans and coastal areas are important for so many reasons.  With the interconnectedness of ecosystems, the problems of the waters are also going to have an impact on other things.  For some, there are spiritual and/or religious reasons to care about ocean systems, including a sense that they (or things within the oceans) are sacred, and that we are supposed to be caretakers of the oceans/coasts.  Along with this, some believe the living things in the oceans have rights that we should not violate by threatening the water quality.  Concern for the well-being of our own species should make us care for a number of reasons.  Our health is affected by water quality, a loss of an important food source (for some parts of the world, the loss of fish as a food source is a major concern).  Poor water quality also means spoiled natural beauty, and a damaged recreational source.  Rising waters would bring the coastline inward in certain regions, wiping out cities.  Life in cultures that depend on the oceans for their livelihood would be destroyed/dramatically altered.

===subject:Why we should care
===message:As we have learned, the state of the oceans is extremely critical to all live on Earth.<p>

If we pollute the quality of the waters, we create dead zones, oxygen-lacking areas in the ocean, which kills off extremely large numbers of immobile creatures, and forces those that can swim out of them to leave the area and go elsewhere, sometimes right into the hands of people on the shoreline. This has devasting effects on the ecosystems in those areas.<p>

If the temperature of the oceans rises too much, some creatures and the coral reefs, which have little tolerance for water temperatures above those that they can live in, will die off. The coral reefs can be said to be the equivalent of the rain forests on land, housing untold numbers and species of creatures. When these are die off due to too high temperatures, or trawling nets drag through and wreck them, the habitat for many essential creatures to the ecosystem are killed or removed to other areas. This can elimiate essential food sources or predators for other species, throwing everything out of balance.<p>

The life that exists in the ocean is more than just for our food and economy. Although it has its place as such, we have to be extremely care to not overfish, because we can cause irreversible damage to the ecosystem.<p>

Another reason we should care about the temperature of the oceans is because of global warming and water levels along the coast. If global temperatures get too high, the polar icecaps will start melting too much, and we will see a devastating trend of erosion further inland and rising water levels. Once we cross the point of no return in terms of the melting process, we will have set in motion the next ice age, and there may be no way to stop it.

The warmer everything gets, the more the polar caps will begin melting away and the higher the sea levels will get. This could turn into a real problem as we could not only have high levels of erosion and problems on the coast, but we could also begin a new ice age. This could happen with temperature changes as new currents begin to form and send us towards a future ice age from which we cannot get out of for many many years.

===message:Beyond the effect the ocean has on the human soul there are some very fundamental needs which it provides, air water and heat distribution (climate). Since many others have dealt with the fish and biodiversity problems I will speak to these.<p>


The original atmosphere did not have any free oxygen. This  developed only after photosynthesis. When we consider that the oceans cover 71% of the earth it stands to reason that most of the oxygen we breathe comes from oceanic plants and plankton. Melissa identified them and speaks well to the subject but I would add a reminder that these "critters" only live in the top few hundred feet of the ocean (that's about as far as useful wavelengths penetrate). You don't have to take out the whole ocean to do great harm. In the Southern Ocean these plankton are already under severe stress with the loss of the ozone layer over Anarctica in their spring, which had shielded them from incoming radiation. As far as photosynthesis goes the tropical oceans are not great producers. The temperate and polar regions are much richer. Colder waters hold more dissolved oxygen for ocean life. Already in California we are seeing our great seaweed beds migrating northward. Our big kelp only grows when the ocean is below 55 degrees. <p>


A second point is that ocean and atmospheric circulation world-wide is driven by the DIFFERENCES between the temperature of the tropics and the arctic regions. Water evaporated from the oceans will fall as rain on the farms in Iowa as the storm tracks move with this circulation. If the ocean warms this difference is reduced and the weather changes. If a storm doesn't move we have the floods of 1993. If the rain never moves inland we have a dust bowl. This circulation also moderates the climate, pumping heat to the poles and cool to the tropics allowing us Homo sapiens to spread out all over the place. We are the lab rats of a rather poorly designed experiment. <p>


The ocean has also provided us with oil - the dead bodies of all of those plankton and while it is no recoverable in human time scales the future ocean bottom will produce less without them. <p>

Regardless of where you live, on the coast or in the middle of a desert, you are dependent on water.  I can't think of too many people that think that a nice brown, contaminated glass of water is refreshing or that would want to pay to eat a tasty trout caught near the discharge pipes of industries.  The temperature of the world's oceans is also of concern.  I have little knowledge other than that obtained from the text of "Ocean's End," but from that I did gather from reading the warming of the oceans could be devastating to life as we know it, that however may not be a bad thing.  Nature has its own way of healing itself and of getting rid of diseases much the way humans do.  I am one that puts some belief in the natural progression of things, currently I think humans are kind of the disease that is causing an imbalance in the oceans and other areas of the world, which in the end will come back to haunt us.

If things keep continuing in the direction their headed weather patterns and seasons could be severely off making for a hard crop season because the water that rains on those crops comes from the ocean and carried to us by storms, current, pressure and winds.

Currently I am take Agronomy / Meteorology 206 through ISU, and its amazing how every little thing affects the world in a big way. Lets start with the quality of water. Everything in the world depends on water. Weather we actually drink it, water our plants with it, eat the fish that comes from it, live by it, bath in it, or just totally forget about it, we use it. The quality of water that resides on the earth is important because everything is dependent on the water for survival.

Now the temperature. As learned from my meteorology course, the temperature of both land and water determines the weather patterns around the world. An example of this is El Nino. When the water temperatures change even a few degrees, weather patterns change. Hence an area of the world that usually has high precipitation my find itself in a drought or just the opposite. When these changes occur in major agricultural areas, it affects the world. Prices may go up, then we find ourselves in an economical crunch which can then domino in just about any direction. Also along with the rise in temperature goes life. Migration of different species may be induced, or plant life can be hindered and once again the domino effect starts.

All in all, everything affects our world that we call home, so yes we should care cause right now…we only have one place to stay.

===message:The oceans make up 71% of the earth, which means that they obviously play an important role in the ecosystem of the world.  The oceans can provide resources such as fish/crabs/etc., but only if these species are allowed to sustain near-natural levels.  The ocean also aids in controlling the climate through currents which move warm water toward the poles and bring sediment-rich cold water back.  Without living, breathing oceans, the earth will simply start to fail, and quickly die.  Coastal areas are the nursuries of the sea, and if we continue to pollute and destroy the coastline, we will eventually kill the sea.<BR>
The heating of the sea also means the rising of the sea, which is of great import to those living on or near the coasts, or in low-lying places like New Orleans.  We must take strides to reduce pollution which causes global warming, or we will further destroy the beaches of the world by forcing the seas to rise above them.<BR>

Without water we could not survive, and if the ocean is constantly polluted with poison and toxin then this could effect our quality of life. The question is far more important than not catching fish, but the quailty of global warming,hydraulic power, conservation, general sanitation,traveling, and sea business. 

On a smaller scale the city of Des Moines had a great flood in 1993 in which its water plant was knock down and citizens were without water to bathe,shower,cook, or clean. The Red Cross and National Guards had to set up temporary water tanks on various corners and citizens would have to bring jugs to fill their water to take home. You would not believe how much water means to daily life until you are not with out it. Try dumping gallons of water in the toilet stool because the water is not flowing freely. If the Des Moines river was as not as polluted, then people could have gotten their supplies from this resource. But you and I know this would have cause quite a few people to become ill or dead. So, yes it is of great concern for the citizens of this world to have an interest in the status of oceans. Because without quality water their would not be any life.

<p>If the temperature of the world's oceans increases by only a few degrees, it will have a disasterous effect on the world's coastal regions.  The melting of the polar ice caps would result in submergence of entire cities located in coastal regions.  This means that all of those people--that 80% of the population that will soon be living within 1 hour of the coast--will suddenly be headed inland, looking for higher ground.</p>

<p>Some of the highest ground in the United States is located near the rugged peaks of the Rocky Mountains in the State of Colorado.  This means that even more people than during the 1990s will be moving to Colorado!</p>

<p>So for the sake of the Alpine ecosystems (not to mention global weather patterns) and the memory of John Denver, let's all hope that the Earth's ocean temperatures go through no sudden changes.</p>

===subject:We Need Them
===message:Yeah, I grew up in Michigan (here I go with that again) so I do understand being close to water, though not an ocean.  I think that it is important to remember that the oceans make up 71% of the planet.  They are the fat on a fat person, get rid of them and she is skin and bones right?  Well the earth can't be skin and bones because then we would die without water.  So we have to preserve and nurture what we have.  
<p>
The temperature getting warmer is potentially disastrous for many small countires and islands and they could be wiped out entirely.  If we were to look at our own continental impact, think of the special on hurricanes hitting New Orleans but at a slower pace to give people more time to say "doh!"  We need to address the possibility of rising sea levels and populations growing along the coasts and how they may not be able to stay there if the sea level keeps rising because of high temps and other oceanic disruptions.  
<p>
Finally, if we stop caring (as it seems at times we already have) then the quality of life in the oceans will continue to decline.  Already we have rendered species extinct--some without notice for decades, because of our greed for the resources that the oceans provide.  Over-fishing is killing our ocean life and unless we stop this practice soon, we are doomed to have dead oceans that rival the dead seas like the Black Sea.

===subject:We should care
===message:We should DEFINITELY care about our oceans.  Our lives are dependent on it.  The temperature of the ocean determines our weather (droughts, hurricanes, floods, etc...).  This in turn affects vegetation, then animals, then us.  Also, the temperature will determine whether or not we lose our coasts, or go into another ice age.  
Not only does the temperature affect us, but the life that inhabits these oceans affects us as well.  We get A LOT of our oxygen from the plants in the ocean.  The last time I checked that was something we needed to survive.  Not only that, but many animals and birds are dependent on this life as a means of food.  These creatures are also a huge food source for us. We have a whole circle of life to think about.  If we ignore the conditions of our oceans, we ignore our future.

===subject:Warning: Imagination Required
===message:<p>I represent <a href="http://movies.warnerbros.com/devils/">Al Pacino</a>, everyone else can be Keanu Reeves.

<p>Why should we care about investing time, money, and energy into preserving and ensuring the ongoing existence of our oceans?  We should not.

<p>Technology will outdate the need for our global environment.  Stretch your mind, open your imagination.  We humans, the masters of innovation, have struggled against the odds throughout our existence only to flourish upon the face of the earth.  The quirk of our mental genius is truly the only explanation, allowing us to adapt to environments in which our physical bodies would have never permitted.  So why should a dying ocean be any different?  What do we truly gain from the existence of our Earth’s blue wonders?

<p>The opportunity cost of investing in the well-being of our planet’s water may be high if not infinite.  We have already proven to be ignorant with our dealings with the ocean in our construction of sea walls and groins.  We still do not fully understand the workings and nuances of the coast.  Could our efforts to revitalize them be in vain?  Perhaps we would be better off investing our time in technology that will improve the quality of lives of human beings, ridding us of our dependence on the Earth’s fragile ecosystem.  Advanced water purification systems, new concepts of synthetic nutrition, continued exploration into the depths of understanding the human body and its weaknesses, and innumerous other ideas and innovations yet to be imagined could be inspired by our pursuit of ecological independence.  Humankind can sacrifice the largely simple pleasures of eating a salmon, walking through parks, and mowing the yard.  Ever feeling reminiscent of the green days, jump into your Microsoft simulator, insert a $25 coin, and be whisked away to an artificial world of Earthly smells, sights, and sensations.

<p>"And as we're straddling from one deal to the next, who's got his eye on the planet, as the air thickens, the water sours, and even the bees' honey takes on the metallic taste of radioactivity? And it just keeps coming, faster and faster. There's no chance to think, to prepare; it's buy futures, sell futures, when there is no future!"

===message:Any living creature deepends on the oceans in some way to survive. The basic way human beings depend on the ocean is not only for the fish but for transport.  Increase heat causes increase waves, hence hard for ships to sail-this alters commerce.
The Black Sea is now dead and so were towns around it when tourists stop visiting this part of the world.  Hypoxia kills some micro organisms which is food to the shrimp, which is food to man.
So the oceans; the shrimps, fish, algae and man, we all need them.

===subject:Why Should we Care (accidently posted in topic 5)
===message:Our oceans are very important to the whole planet.  First the fish are important for food and beauty and they depend on the entire system of ocean life to survive.  As the books state over and over, if you kill the environment the larger animals and quality of life for everything in the area soon dies as well.  This is the bigger picture we must consider when asking why care about the ocean.  If we kill the ocean we doom ourselves in the process.  We can assume that the ocean will be something we can hide behind a big wall when it is smelly and polluted beyond reason.  It will come back and get us one way or another delivering the very pollution back to the people who sent it there.   This leads us to the very real possibility that we may already be heading down this road and need to rethink what we are doing.  When the species are gone and the water is polluted like the Black Sea our options are not as attractive as they currently are.

===subject:I care (now)!!
===message:Although I would have honestly said "I sure don't care" a few years ago, I feel like such an idiot now for being able to have thought such a thing.  After doing the readings for this class (as I had no prior knowledge on coastal issues), I recently became aware of the ocean and the importance of water quality, water temperature, sea level rising, etc.  There is no question- all of this matters...A LOT!!  However, the problem is that there are too many people like myself a few months ago that have absolutely no understanding of this importance.  I have to admit, I used to get turned off when hearing about environmental issues because I thought, "True, the environment may get hurt but it is more important bring in money".  But now I understand the larger scale of these problems- what happens when the beaches are gone?  How much land will we lose if the ocean rises just a little bit?  How many will suffer from the loss of ocean life in regards to business (not to mention the snowballing environmental effects)?  I think the question should be, "KNOWING why we should be interested in the quality of the water, temperature of the water, and life in the ocean's, how do we educate people?"

===message:We can't forget that thanks to the ocean's temperature, salinity, and characteristics, life on land is intimately tied to state of the ocean.  Not just in gathering food or with respect to climate, but our body is just over 70% water, too.  The way our membranes work is due in part to during evolution's march onward, creatures living in the sea needed to balance the water in their bodies with the environment around them.  If you want to get quaternary about it, Iowa was once under a giant ocean (if you do some serious daredevil soil stuff at Saylorville you can check out this rockin' paleosol) and is now a major source of food and fuel for the world.  The ocean is in us and beneath us, even in Iowa.

===message:Oceans are the cradle of life on earth.  For us to ignore them is eventual suicide.  Nothing can survive without them.  It takes a class such as this to put perspective on how important the oceans really are.  If temperature treands continue, "Waterworld" could be a reality a mere 200 years down the road.  We have no idea the possibilities and the characteristics of the species that we are destroying on the ocean floor, or of the rain forests for that matter, which is speeding ocean destruction.  Not to mention the diseases that can be spread in contaminated ocean water.  Field runoff, sewage disposal, oil spills, overfishing, and coastal development and messing up our oceans.  Thousands of human lives and billions of fish and plant lives have been lost already due to our shortsightedness.  At some point, people must start to care about the life our oceans, or there won't be life left to care about.

===message:The oceans are truly the lifeblood of our planet and the deteriation of the oceans, will lead to the deteriation of life.  The entire food chain, top to bottom, can be traced to the oceans and the bacteria that live within it.  Without a stable food chain inside the oceans, the food chain on land will collapse.  As much as the human species hates to admit it, we can't simply invent a new food chain with an infinite supply.  The oceans have limits and they are the only source we have.  So we better protect it, or else.

===message:Even if you live in the very center of a very large land-locked continent, what happens in the oceans directly or indeirectly affects everyone. Through the textbooks and readings I'e learned how the health of a coral reef off the coast of Belize should be a concern to an industialized country like the U.S. These studies illustrate how the earth is so delicately interconnected and every small upset has far reaching and lasting effects. The oceans and everything they hold is also of huge economic importance. The aesthetics of the oceans supports a booming tourist industry which- through more beter policies- can be managed more sustainably. The fishing industry is an international, multibillion doller industry that provides jobs and food for millions of people. the health of the oceans becomes a mirror for what we can expect on land and the environment that we inhabit.

===message:Oceans are needed by everyone and everything.  Balanced ecosystems in the ocean mean balanced ecosystems on land.  Not only that, oceans are a source of food, revenue, recreation, and transportation.  Much of the ocean still remains a mystery to people.  With time and research, who knows what cures will be found or what alternate food sources will be discovered.  All of this is contingent on the health of the world's oceans, though.  People need to be aware that no matter where they live, what they do, what they eat, their future depends on the condition of the oceans.

The oceans supply us with so much, from balancing the environment, to providing us with some food.  If we didn't have the oceans, would we have found this continent, as well as other continents.  Plus, one of the biggest reasons is that they can provide us with water, if something happens to the rivers, lakes, and streams, we have the technology to turn the salt water into water we can drink, unless of course, someone out there thinks we as people can live without water.

In essence, that means non-poisonous water that has marine life.  The temperature is relative. (I live in Maine and the temp in May was 50!)<p>
I, along with our nation, view the ocean/beaches/sun as luxury.  Especially those of us who are land locked in Iowa, traveling to the Atlantic or Pacific is a big deal.  I would not be a happy camper if I got all the way to the ocean to find the beaches all closed because of pollution.  <p>
So, I care!  Public awareness is sure one powerful way to keep the public caring too.  Information in the form of statistics, suggestions or laws will keep our oceans alive.

===message:Everyone should be interested in the quality of the oceans ecosystem.  The quality of ocean water is important because it evaporates into the air and ends up as rainwater on land and elsewhere.  The water is also important to growing food to feed people and if we pollute the waters then we eventually end up polluting our food system.  With the rising temperatures of the ocean the coastal lands are being taken under the sea.  And as the temperatures rise more, eventually will have to re-learn how to live under water.

If the water is full of poisons then nothing will be able to survive; plants, humans, animals every thing with die. Even if humans could survive directly they would die eventually due to lack of oxygen or lack of food supply. The same thing matter applies to water temperature. If water temperature gets to great marine life will die and it will greatly affect human life. Also, ice will melt making Tennessee beachfront land. Every person should be concerned about what happens to his or her surrounding environment. Conditions may come about that do not affect people directly but could destroy them indirectly.
