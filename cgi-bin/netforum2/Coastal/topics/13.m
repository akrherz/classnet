===message: Some nations have more at stake than others, the difference being mostly in landsize territory, and reliance on coastal areas for present, and future development. The dilemma is not determined by level of economic or social development, i.e. in the event of water levels raising Japan would more affected than Rusia, even though the latter is highly un-developed in comparison with the former.
<P>The U.S. would have to take into consideration the lost of territory that's strategically important, both economically, and militarily. Cities with high population density would be wiped out as water level raises due to climatological changes influenced by industrial pollution.
<p> The breaking of the food chain would definately affect the economy, hence the social order, and welfare of the nation. Although scientifically we have been able to produce certain aliments, not everything can be "design", at least not yet. In the even that we can produce food in labs, other poorer nations won't have this luxury which would trigger massive immigration waves. Increased immigration would also tip the balance in citizenshipry security and welfare, ultimately leading to international conflicts. Scarcity of food sources, and inhabitable territory represent the same threads to all in the planet.

===subject:Discussion #10 The Coastal Areas and My Professional Future
===message:By God I wish I had the answer to this discussion topic!  There are two genuine directions that my professional career may turn in the next five years.  They are intermingled and I do not pressure myself to decide on either at this time.  At present, I am focused on furthering my academic study towards an environmental [oceanic/maritime/marine] law degree while keeping an eye on opportunities for my other personal interest, the charter fishing and diving industry.  I wish I knew which one is more valuable to me, but I must admit to enjoying both.  I find myself consumed by wanting to have an impact on protecting resources from illegal use and abuse, but at the same time have a strong desire to introduce people to these areas to increase the awareness of what true gifts mother nature has freely bestowed upon us.  I feel, that if we do not expose people and explain the critical nature of our coastal zones, we will never overcome the lack of respect society subjects them to.  Either way, an in-depth background on coastal and oceanic issues will force me to be a better "teacher" and "friend" to these areas which I hold so dear.  If money and stamina hold out, my preference would be to see the completion of a law degree with a coastal influence, including acquiring a Master's of Coastal Law with the University of Miami complete with an immersion of law study in marine ecology, marine pollution, water law, admiralty, law of the sea, and Caribbean law.  Once this acquired, I can then continue teaching as an educated authority on the subject.  My life has fortunately allowed me a tremendous real exposure to the marine environment, but one that is lacking in education.  With a formal education I believe I can have an impact and can keep some of these areas for future generations to enjoy.  And I can do this without personally needing it to be a commercial enterprise (chartering) that I must make a living from, but more as a philanthropic measure, which would warm my heart.  Capt. Dave

===subject:Different View
===message:I wish to evaluate the implications/consequences of adopting the policies to reverse the decline of coastal areas and oceans by relating them to core political concepts such as justice, liberty, power, equality, and authority.  In doing so, I believe a cogent argument can be made for the adoption of the policies advocated in Woodard’s book.  First of all, justice as a core political concept is not normally applied to any species outside that of home sapiens.  There is an exception; when a species or ecosystem is on the verge of extinction or catastrophic damage a justice like calculus is applied.  I contend that other species and ecosystems require inclusion sooner and with greater importance.  Indeed, all of the major theories of justice—Mill’s five aspects of justice, classical liberal theories of justice, and a monistic liberal conception—can be applied to other species and ecosystems.  In effect, the practice will tie other species and ecosystems to the notions of legality, moral rights, positive and negative rights, which will aid in the defense of their existence against human actions.  For example, cod and coral reefs under this interpretation would have a right within Locke’s theory of justice to life, liberty, and property.  In reality, this will not mean they have a right to own a ranch style home in Huxley, but a right to exist, to choose where they will exist, and have a home (habitat or ecosystem free from the deleterious effects of human action.
	In addition, the application of liberty to other species and ecosystems may engender the policies that Woodard advocates.  Negative freedom appears to be extremely salient when one speaks about the liberty of other species.  Succinctly, negative liberty is the absence of impediments to action, and do we not impede other species when we fish them to the brink of extinction or pollute an ecosystem to a point it ceases to function.  I believe arguments can be made that utilize the core political concepts for the adoption of stricter regulations of CFC’s, car emissions, factory pollutants, nutrient pollution, and land use of coastal areas.  Is it not about time we give equal treatment or something close to it to other species and ecosystems!
	I believe if we argue from a different viewpoint, we may be able to overcome the economic, political, or social implications/consequences of the policies.  That is, we may not see the loss of jobs of jobs in “cancer alley” if we understand and argue that it is the just thing to do.  Saving species and ecosystems in the long run is right and aids us in our pursuits and existence.

===message:I think the first step in improving our coastal policies is acknowledging that there are problems in our coastal areas. I think something the book did a wonderful job of is discussing the major problems with the fishing industry. Something needs to be done with the large  vessels that deplete the fish populations. The economic impact of losing these species so rapidly will be felt across the world, as explained by Woodward. The problem politically is that these issues do not get the modern day exposure they deserve, and I think that is something that students and instructors of coastal policy have to seriously consider: "How can we get these issues out in the open so people will care about them more and be willing to help take action." If they continue to be ignored, nothing will ever be done. The problem is how do you draw the line between taking people's private property away and making it public and how do you tell people they have to stop visiting their favorite coastal areas??? It will be a very politically sensitive subject since most people would not be willing to give up their favorite beach locations, (whether that be a resrt or beach home) to preserve an environment. They have to have a better understanding of the policies and why they are going to be implemented (i.e. the immediate danger of beach erosion, damaged ecosystems, ect...). This course did a great job of raising our awareness to these issues, now our job is to go and help implement these policies by raising awareness in others.

Nevertheless, this growing situation has the enormous potential of affecting life as we know it today and because of this immediate controls must be put in place to rectify the situation as soon as possible.  As with all "problems" we are trying to fix, many facets are involved. The immediate staggering economic impact will override many government officials decision, it usually does.  However, what are the economic losses now and what will they be in the future if we don't do something? Like Collin Woodard says in her book "elminating the large fishing ships will help restore the fish population."  Seems like a simple solution to me. Neverthless the economics of any incident effects the judgement determination of most if not all resolutions.  Public perception of any problem is the key to the dissolution of a given situation. That perception will be paramount in altering what is now taking place, in the oceans, and what will happen in the future.  We "all" have a responsibilty to "take care" of what mother nature has bestowed on us.  Unfortunately for some greed still determines "their" course of action.

The countries of kenya and Tanzania rely on tourism for income and this tourists need restaurants and hotels. Moreover, those who owned these establishments are influensive people and will do whatever necessary to stop any voices raised about 'saving the beach'.
The general public in this countries do not have the knowledge about the consequences of "killing the beach", and even if they do, these businesses are sources of employment and people will just leave them alone.
To reverse the decline of coastal areas, U.N and the agencies concerned should assist these governments with funds as subsidies if they carry out policies to save the coastal areas.

===message:This is a serious difficulty and at the risk of sounding Un-American I offer a few thoughts.<p>

Our countries ideas of personal property were developed when the land needed settlers. Our population was not large enough to hold the land against the Native Americans so we actively imported people. "Claim Jumper" is an evil person who took what was yours. As our population is now bursting the coastal seams, perhaps we need to rethink some of our core values. In the island nations of Melanesia, The land and the sea (reef) belong to the village. You can only fish on your reef, you can only garden on your village's land. Husbandry of the resources is well planned. WE don't fish to extinction - or WE will starve: there is no other source of food. Some peoples (the Chumash, in California) had religious figures who proclaimed when the clams could be taken, and how much. In the Solomon Islands, women have known birth control for centuries, Some plants control conception others are abortifactants. The men know nothing of "women's " medicine but the population will not exceed the resources. The question I wonder about is are these people somehow less "free" than I am because they have managed to live within their budgets? <p>

American / European culture has changed before - we now bathe regularly, expect a universal education for children, gave slaves freedom...  It is not easy or pleasant to change an attitude and a culture but I think the time of limits is upon us. Overcrowding and habitat (ours) destruction will also change our culture and without any planning.<p>

We can use tax policies, insurance policies (as we discussed regarding Florida), the media and schools and any other method to begin the process of instituting reforms. The boycot of grapes in California led to higher wages for farm workers and a greater measure of respect. Boycotting and taxing the products of the great trawlers will eventually make them uneconomical. Buying coastal property after disasters for public domain, economic incentives to relocate business away from the coast and keeping agricultural land in agriculture are things we can begin. Policies to let nature take its course are probably not feasible but we could reduce public expenditure for infra-structure in areas of repeated flooding and surge.<p>

You can't base the system on altruism alone, there must be rewards for the right thing. What ever "right" is. For my future, I teach - I have a message to communicate but it has to have other support.

On paper they all seem to work but in reality very few of them I feel would make it very far.  To start with we live in an era of large corporations, the "little man" has for the most part become an extinct species in the economic world.  The numbers apparently show that getting rid of the large fishing companies would work out for everyone because they are not necessarily needed, but it really doesn't work out.  Those companies are established and are most likely connected to upper level government officials in some way or another and are most likely to stay, whereas the individual fisherman is not a member of a union nor does he/she have the time to fight against the large corporation that has many more resources than any number of private fishermen.  <p>   Governments will always gives subsidies to larger businesses because it would be political suicide to not and to just let businesses that are unsuccessful die out.  On top of that established oil companies and every other industry, entertainment, person everywhere I feel would be very reluctant to a large promotion of different energy sources by governments, it just costs too much to change.  I think the energy source change will have to evolve through private initiatives, and possibly by local governments, but not national.

Unfortunately, either time or a miracle is needed to get the laws passed and changes implemented to preserve what we still can and prevent further damage to our oceans and its creatures. Until large numbers of Americans and/or citizens of other nations are well informed enough about the true situation of our oceans and the irreversible damage being done, there will not be enough mobilization and public outcry to get things done. We need to begin educating people about the seriousness of these issues early on. A new, young, and educated group of leaders, politicians, and policymakers can perhaps implement the needed changes.

<p>I agree that, as several other posters have noted, the Kyoto Treaty marks an important implication for environmental policy with regards to developed versus developing nations.  Developing nations will not lead the way on policy as they will feel exploited by developed nations.  Thus, developing nations much take the position of role model with regards to environment policy.  It is evident that the leaders of the world, other than the United States, are willing to do so.  The Bush administration essentially pointed a finger and said, “Why does the baby get a child’s set and all I get is this lousy seatbelt? I’m not wearing mine.”

<p>But for the United States to implement a broad spectrum of environmental initiatives would be dangerous to the quality of life we currently expect and as many Americans feel, constitutionally deserve.  If we seek to preserve our oceans we must sacrifice the short-run economic prosperity of the lost economy.  We must also sacrifice a growing trend to retire to the coast.  Florida can’t be full of gray-haired, walker-toting immigrants.  Retirement in the Midwest (and we know how boring that is) must be encouraged.  The dream needs to shift from a catamaran to a stable of horses.  Without question though, any push for retirement in the Midwest would draw criticism as we sacrifice the nation’s breadbasket.  Thus is the zero-sum game of human population and pollution.

<p>Whether the United States would ever implement such policy of environmental reform is an entirely different issue.  Such policy would only be implemented if one of two, or both, shifts in opinion occurred.  1) The number of people truly caring about the environment dramatically increases or 2) those that benefit from the ocean begin to see an immediate threat to their livelihood.  The former is unlikely; as we understand more about the danger we pose to the environment, we seem less likely to do anything to prevent our wrongs.  The latter is more of an afterthought which we realize we are in a hole only after we dug it beyond any escapable depth.

===message:The implication is that we are destroying not only America, but the rest of the world little by little.  Technology is making it easier and more efficient to dregde the bottom of sea.  Increases in individual income makes it easier and more convenient to vacation in exotic places, and as such we discover new places in which to extort the natural resources of a given territory.  It's a proven fact that resources here on land are limited, but it's never been expressed in regards to the ocean.  Partly because there's still so much we don't know.  However, all we have to do is look to the Baltic Sea.  It can and will happen again and again if we're not careful.

===subject:Coastal policy impact
===message:There are many implications, to speak of, that result from these coastal preservation policies.<p>

For one, it affects the economy in most tourist coastal communities, since if stricter building regulations were inacted, it would force them to move further back from the shores, only be able to build structures of smaller set sizes, etc. This would greatly reduce the capacity of these areas to accomodate the high influx of people who like to visit this regions on any given weekend, especially during the summer months. Also, current structures already in place would either have to be moved further back, with all the costs associated with such an operation, or be allowed to simply "fall off" the shoreline. The problem with the latter solution, of course, is that it introduces a bunch of debris and pollution into the ocean in that region to simply let large office and resort buildings fall into the sea or be washed away.<p>

Politically, it is hard to implement good policy. There is almost always a breakdown between the scientists who are intimately familiar with the problem first hand because of their extensive research, and the politicians who are drafting policies and creating regulatory bodies. There needs to be more involvement by the scientists in drafting policies; a real problem is when findings point to needed actions that cannot be comprimised on, generally are, by the time the policy is finally passed.<p>

But, to the topic of this discussion, the implications are far reaching. Even though some things do need to be done, sometimes there is such a thing as too much regulation over things, to the point that it takes over our personal freedoms/rights. As with everything, balance is needed.

===message:I think the biggest thing we are up against in defending the oceans and coastal areas is political issues.  It has been my experience that economical and social issues are important but political issues are always the hardest to conquer.  Go back to the beginning with the issue of beaches in Miami or any major tourist spot.  How many property owners would be willing to knock down their buildings to protect the coast from futher damage?  None, unless the price was right.  Our policies will protect these people as long as they are making money which brings them power.  Until we can convince these people to change new policies will be slow coming.

===subject:policies of stressed in the book
===message:The economic issues with implementing the policies in the books would be the cost of new or reconstructed infrastructure, such as waste treatment plants, taking land out of development, and who would pay for it.  In relation to this would be costs that would have to be paid by countries that do not have enough cash flow to finance these structures.  There would have to be major financial support from other countries or NGO's to help pay for the building and also the costs of the mandates suggested by the readings.  A political obstacle that would have to be overcome is support of the people to pay for something that has not become a life or death situation yet, such as water quality (in relation to the U.S.) and help people see the environmental benefits, rather than economic, of the policies stressed in the books.

===message:Concerning coastal policy: the public opinion will be varied and the consequences severe.  When I say implementing policies to reverse decline of coastal areas/oceans, I mean taking action to change the current situation of the coast's deterioration.  What will the consequenses be? Well, let's see.  <p>
Economically, and therefore of peak interest to the government, the United States will have to dish out a lot more money in order to enforce policies such as restricting coastal building (including seawalls, jetties, etc), and limiting ocean pollutants (garbage, chemicals).  As mentioned in an early discussion, the reality is that the amount of money needed to make these changes is going to take a LONG time to get, if that.  The government just doesn't plan ahead.
<p>
This leads to the political consequences of implementing policies to benefit the coasts and oceans.  This subject could be a powerful campaigning tool for any presidential-seeking chum.  Americans are honestly interested in saving their beaches but it will take a lot of proding from most to jump on the bandwagon.  Political discussions could help to inform Americans about the realities of the ocean's condition.  Sneaky, proactive, election ploy? Or honest, human concern?
<p> The consequeces are all going to fall back on the people.  It will be their taxes that will increase.  It will be their ocean hotels that have to close.  Do we really want to sacrifice our once a year vacation to save a beach that "really isn't in harms way"?  Opinions are  going to jump back and forth.  The people that do care will not outnumber the rest of the numb country.  This is going to have to be a national commitment and discussions will evolve to amend policies and change their wording until the resorts reopen and barges continue to dump our trash into our oceans.  What has changed?

===message:I chose my profession many years ago, It is the diving industry.I have seen quite alot of coastal armoring and since the begining of this course have noticed the problems associated with it. I admit I was un-educated on the impact armoring had on beaches and the structures it was designed to protect. One thing I will take from this course is the obligation to try to educate my clients on the problems associated with coastal armoring. I don't think it will have much of an effect on them as they are trying to protect thier houses and businesses. I will know in my mind that I tried to help them make a smart decission on the problem coastal armoring has on the beachs and the effects they will have on generations to come.

===message:Political issues are great around any issue where to sides butt heads. Costal management is just another topic where people with money seem more important then nature or your average person. I believe that in tell money is no longer a motive of people then those with mass amounts of money will always win. This could mean that nature and the humane race lose a big battle.
