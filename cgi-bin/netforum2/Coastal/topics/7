===more:<p>Several students have asked if we could introduce ourselves to each other. ONLY people enrolled in Coastal Policy can enter this ClassNet space so it is fairly private. You don;t have to share any information but if you want to post it here. Some of us have short bio information on a web site so we will probably just post our URL.
