===subject:Who I Am
===message:Hi folks, my name is Dave Hutchison.  After being downsized out of a 21 year career in August of 2000, I decided to spend a little time doing something I had never done before, attending college.  I started school last August at the age of 40 with no college credits to my name. If all goes according to plan, I will have completed 60 credit hours by the end of the Summer II session on July 26th (only 11 months) between Marshalltown Community College and ISU.  So far holding a 3.93 gpa.  I feel fortunate to have received the MCC Outstanding English Composition Student Award (I like to write) for 2001-2002 and admittance into Phi Theta Kappa.  I am accepted at ISU this fall and will be entering as a junior.  Current plan is to major in Finance (real world) with a minor in Environmental Studies (fun world).  This is subject to great scrutiny (by me) as I toy with a Political Science major and second major in Environmental Studies in preparation for law school.  Even at the ripe old age of 41, still undecided what I want to be when I grow up as far as the major is concerned.  But the true goal is to complete the BA by December 2003 and apply to law schools that focus on maritime, admiralty, offshore drilling, estuary, and/or ecology law.  That's the academic stuff.  In the middle of all this I also passed Iowa's state insurance exams and became a licensed agent.  During the winter break between classes I took the H & R Block tax prep course and worked three days a week during tax season...boy was I tired with all that school too!  For fun, I maintain a US Coast Guard Captain's license with a Master's Rating.  I'm a certified scuba diver trained to the advanced openwater level with nitrox cert's.  I have had the cavern diving course but was unable to attend the certification dives the day they were given, but this is on the to do list someday, as well as a Rescue Diver rating.  Also an absentee member of an offshore tournament fishing team out of Ozona, Florida.  Anything outdoors usually appeals to me especially if I can introduce someone, especially a child, to a little touch of nature for an appreciation of what we have been given to enjoy.  I was married for 11 wonderful years to the kindest, sweetest woman God has placed in my life yet, but we lost the fight with recurrent cervical cancer on December 12, 1997 and today it is simply me and my Miniature Schnauzer, Bailey, doing the best that we can with each day.  I currently reside in Toledo, Iowa and spend my days studying, studying, and more studying.  My number one goal in life is to do my very best to put a smile on the faces of those around me every chance I get.  Remember, random acts of kindness are appreciated!  Take nothing and no one for granted as we do not know how long we have here.  Best wishes to everyone and have a great summer!  Capt. Dave

===message:I am senior in biology here at ISU.  After I graduate, I am plan on attending grad school and specializing in coastal ecology.  I will be leaving Ames next week and will be arriving in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  There I will be conducting some marine biological research. <p> Even though I have grown up in the Midwest, I have a true love for the oceans. My father introduced me to the Mississippi river when I was quite young, and I have learned a lot from him about the river. But I decided I wanted to study salt water instead of fresh. Whenever I get the time I like to spend time with my dad by going fishing on the river and catching bluegills, they are my favorite! <p> I have really enjoyed reading the two books assigned to this course.  My favorite was Oceans End, since there’s a lot of biological information that is emphasized.  I think Against the Tide forgot some of the more important aspects of the natural environment.  <P>  I hope you all have a great summer!

Stress?  Yeah, I have a lot of it.  15 credits this summer (and I may yet take 3 more just for the punishment) to graduate in this summer term, while working part time with the IDOT has put a strain on my time this summer.  So much for just kicking back and enjoying the rays at the beach!

<P>I currently plan on attending law school.  This has involved a tremendous amount of cramming over the last few weeks as I prep for the LSAT exams (5 days and counting).  The long-term plan is to take part in technology-related policy making ranging from information privacy to bioinformatics.

===message:Hi all!  I am currently a senior at ISU majoring in Political Science and minoring in Environmental Studies.  If all goes well, I'll be graduating in December and off to law school in fall of '03 at either the U of Iowa, Washington, or North Carolina.  I intend to focus either or environmental or sports law.  I work for a Republican state senator when the legislature is in session and officiate high school and college basketball, football, volleyball, and baseball.  I am also the president of an officials association, which requires me to assign officials to games for 25 schools in north central Iowa.  

I have traveled to many countries around the world and most recently was a participant in the fall 2001 Semester at Sea program through the U of Pittsburgh.  Life truly is put into perspective when one sees first hand some of the worst living conditions the world has to offer.  Travel also makes one realize that we're all not so different after all.  One of the goals of all courses with an international perspective such as this one, should be to broaden our world view.  People of the world often have to unite to combat common problems such as coastal destruction that is the focus of this course.  If only it wouldn't have to be conflict that made us put aside our differences, then we truly would be citizens of the world.

On a lighter note, my favorite music comes from Eric Clapton, favorite movie is Casablanca, favorite food is spaghetti, and in my spare time, I love to go sailing, biking, and golfing!

===message:Greetings all,

My name is Rachel Faber Machacha.  I am a graduate student in International Development Studies and I have a BS in Agronomy and a BA in Political Science.  The only time I have been the coast was at Mombasa, which is on the Indian Ocean in Kenya. I have been to Kenya four times, either on study abroad (twice), assisting a study abroad program (once) or to visit (once.) Among the positive externalities of so many trips to Kenya is a decent proficiency in Kiswahili and a terrific husband. (Machacha is Bukuso, not Mexican.) :) For the ISU people, my name may seem slightly familiar as I am a columnist at the Iowa State Daily. So if you want to send me hate mail (or fan mail) you can go to www.iowastatedaily.com.  I love to read, especially history and natural history. I just got done reading "The Things They Carried" by Tim O'Brien and highly recommend it. I listen to classical music, big band jazz, and anything African. I am currently enjoying Smetana's Ma Vlast (My Country) and a nifty West African mix that my friend (who will remain nameless) burned for me. My major contact with water this summer is my water aerobics class, which is a great way to get buff without actually sweating.  Have a great week! RFM

===message:Hi All, I am an Alumna of Iowa State (class of "64") which is ancient history to you all. My parents and one son (Dave) are also ISU grads. Dave is in law school at the U. of Minn. My B.S. from ISU was in Physical Education (I was the first female interscholastic athlete at ISU) After an injury I went back to college at Cal State, Northridge and majored in geology. My thesis work required me to become a marine biologist when I discovered a living population of the seashells on which I was doing a paleontological study.
I am also a scuba instructor and a liscensed private pilot. I teach high school science and a few sections of Geol. 101 (which we offer at our high school and the University grants their credit). For fun I play the harp and fly search and rescue missions with the Civil Air Patrol. I also like to write and have made it fairly profitable. I grew up along the Santa Monica coast and when I get too far from the ocean my gills dry up.

Like several of you I plan to attend law school after graduating next May. I have not yet decided which area of law I would like to specialize in, and consequently am taking this class to broaden my horizons and keep my options open. The majority of my time this summer is spent working at the University Bookstore - stop by the general books desk sometime if you want to chat coastal policy. I spend most of my time with my wonderful boyfriend of three years, or with my family and friends. I listen to lots of Weezer, Eve 6 and Lit, watch lots of movies (favorites? the Mummy & sequel, Episodes II & IV, Kevin Smith movies), love Bill Maher and Bill O'Reilly, and am sweating my way through the summer in kickboxing class (maybe I should have tried aqua aerobics). Ah, and the rest of my summer I will spend failing but dilligently trying to catch up on sleep.....

Here are just a few facts about me:

Major-Public Service and Administration in Agriculture

Future Plans-Taking a year off to get state residency, then attending law school in Oregon

Favorite movie-When Harry Met Sally (Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a close second)

Favorite Book-Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury (if you haven't read it-you should)

I majored in Political Science, but have no clue what I might do with it.  As of right now, I plan on working for a year and going to law school a year from now.  In regards to this course, I had absolutely no background in the topic so everything I read and saw was new to me.
