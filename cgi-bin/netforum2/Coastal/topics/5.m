===message:Laws, building codes, regulations, seems like we have plenty of them.  However, when the environment is in question there has to be something in place to help safe guard that environment.  Every governor wants economic development in their state.  Sometimes this development takes presdence over the environment, this is wrong.  I myself would not recommend any new laws or regulations but would instead create a panel of both environmentalists and construction experts to study and advise on each building project where the environment could be damaged.  That way I, as governor, could get both sides of the issue.

===subject:Governor Melissa Millman and her policies
===message:If I was a governor of a major coastal state, lets say like Florida, there would be a lot of laws and regulations that I would create.  Many of these policies would be created to protect the natural beaches that are founded on this coastal area. <p> The first policy that I would create, in which Florida lawmakers have already taken some responsibilities, is about protecting the endangered animals that have used Florida as their natural habitat.  I would develop even harsher laws that deal with the interference of humans with sea turtles and manatees.  One of the most popular facts Florida conservationists are telling people is about the lighting situation.  When young sea turtles hatch from their eggs on the beach they use the moon light as a path to return to the ocean.  When people have their car headlights on or streetlights present at this time it confuses the baby sea turtles and some tend to go toward the light and away from the ocean.  I would definitely develop harsher laws that would prohibit any type of light construction at a certain radius, so the sea turtles could return to the water.  I would also develop policies that would not allow any type of aquatic vehicle or land development around manatee living quarters.  I think that manatees need their space and human protection.  Land construction already harms these animals by polluted run-off and erosion that leads to their habitat being destroyed.  They are endangered and I feel they should be able to have lots of room to roam and live freely. <p>  Another policy I would implement about coastal construction would be particularly about construction on barrier islands.  I would not allow people to build on islands that were less then maybe 20 miles wide (I am not quite sure how wide an island should be before it is some what safe, so maybe 20 miles would be ok).  I would develop this policy to limit people who want to build on islands like the Galveston Island that was only about 3 miles wide.   It makes sense to me that there should be strict regulations on building on vulnerable islands especially because this law not only protects people but also saves the federal government millions of relief dollars that they would have to pay citizens if a huge storm or hurricane arrived.  Another policy that I would like to create would be about space.  I would try to develop a plan to space hotels apart or other large buildings from each other.  This regulation would allow less coastal areas to become too overpopulated.  This would also allow the beaches to restore naturally and decrease the need for beach armor since no buildings would be present.

===subject:Discussion #4:  Construction on the Coast
===message:Increased legislation leads to increased arbitration in the US, especially when economics are involved.  Our coastal areas present wonderful opportunities for wealth as described in our class materials.  This is obviously where the world's population is expressing its desire to be.  What we are experiencing is a lack of understanding and education of our environment versus the human pursuits of pleasure and greed.  Until taking this course, I for one, did not realize the extent of damage already created from our past mistakes.  Countless times I've stood on the Galveston Seawall and never once realized, that prior to the wall, there once lay a pristine beach.  Ignorance is bliss.  It is slightly overwhelming to someone, who loves the beachfront and estuaries as much as I do, to try and comprehend what has happened and propose corrective measures with such a limited background on the subject.  I tend to make it too personal because these areas are dear to my heart. I know this is unreasonable, given I share this country with 280,000,000 others, who may differ in opinion on acceptable uses for these areas.  It is hard for me to fathom our "progress" stopping, including further construction on our coasts.  I simply do not see that happening.  However, I see the need for those who are highly educated on this subject to spread their knowledge to the rest of us [such as this course], including our elected officials, citizens, and even foreign guests (tourists). In this way, we may then be able to exact legislative changes and funding that are positive steps in protecting this resource.  Our country remains one focused on the right of its citizens to own property.  We must accept this will not change nor do we really want it to.  We are also a country who's foundation was based on taking risks.  Those building on the coast need to assume the risk [and liabilities] associated with building on the coast.  Is this concept unreasonable in our society now, to be responsible for one's own self, or have we succumbed to as the book title states, "I Am Not My Own Fault"?  Our coastal resources contains so much value in real estate, aesthetics, personal pleasure, and employment that it will continue to be ravaged by society.  We can argue about who pays for insurance and disaster relief, or we can wallow in pity about our losses; but until the people who create the actual damage become responsible for themselves and until someone presents themselves as a leader with strong support in returning these areas to their natural state, we will sit as we do now and watch further decay of a treasure and precious resource.  As deep as I have looked into this issue for answers, I admit the following to myself, building will not stop because some want it to and maximum use of all resources will plague us, even to our own detriment, as long as our population is expanding and we have the wealth to utilize it.  The only solution I truly see is to fight fire with fire.  Support and funding must be acquired and these areas repurchased in the name of the public.  Sometimes we have to protect ourselves from ourselves.  But I admit, I can find no one single answer to an immediate fix, but it seems only rational to me that we must regain ownership of our beaches to protect them.  Yet, I acknolwedge, this does nothing to restore the sediment limitations described on the west coast from concreting drainage areas, dams, and other inland control structures affecting the coastal zone.  My vote is for a program that allows us to purchase and protect these areas and require those who interrupt the natural order of things, to be responsible citizens and restore or replace what they have taken, at their expense.

What I have gathered from "Against the Tide," which is my only source on the subject so my policies are based on a very narrow amount of "facts," I would not allow any kind of beach armoring or replenishing at all.  Construction on the beaches would be limited to lemonade stands and an occasional little bungalow as long as it did not require altering the landscape to put it in place nor did it disrupt the natural flow of the environment it was in.  Nothing that was expected to be a permanent structure would be allowed inside of the area between the sand dunes and the water, that would also be the case on any barrier islands ocean or sound sides.  Access to the beaches would be given to all who wished to use it, however you would have to walk to get there.  I could go on but I won't, I think the direction I am going is pretty evident.  I will add a little bit about the natural replenishment of the beaches, which invovles inland operations.  There will have to be consideration taken when developing inland as to what effect it will have on the flow of runoff soil that will deposit on the beaches. How this is to be solved I have no idea, I am still thinking about that.  One thing I think would help would be that all dams would be required to open up occasionally like that described in "Against the Tide" at the Grand Canyon, which would mean possible flooding, obviously building in the areas to be flooded would be discouraged.  The more I think about this the more I realize how much everything is actually connected, runoff in Iowa probably in some way can alter the beaches in the Gulf.  It is really overwhelming.  When it comes down to it any program developed to help the coasts or any other environmental area must be both national and international, sure a governor can implement things to solve the problems in his or her state but those problems will continue regardless of individual success as long as the states around it continue with unhealthy practices.  It is a long drawn out process that must begin from the top.

     1. Most of our coast is backed by fairly steep cliffs and is not easily accessable.
     2. Most of those who live on the beach are my main campaign contributers.
     3. Southern California cannot naturally support more than about 150,000 people (we have more than 9 million).
     4. The longshore currents eventually carry the beach sand into a series of deep canyons (hundreds of feet deep and below the area where the next seasons waves will return it). California beaches have been starving since the rise of sea level began as the last ice age melted.
<br>
However, I think there are many things I could do to improve the situation. These include:
     1. Educate, starting in the elementary grades, about the coastal processes with a goal of a citizenry who understands what is going on.
     2. Our already cemented water channels in the south have to stay, flooding is too hazardous to the increased population. BUT when the storm channels are cleaned out each year dump the sand on the downstream side of the channel instead of hauling it to a landfill. Then slowly let the cement on the bottom of the channel erode and return to a natural state while maintaing the cement side walls to keep it channeled. The goal is some natural replacement of sand.
     3. Outlaw all mining of sand and gravel deposits in the riverbeds (common in so. cal. - the streams are dry most years).
     4. Allow generous tax write-offs for donating coastal property to the state for preservation. Even after storm damage.
     5. Actively encourage the Nature Conservancy and similar organizations to broker land purchases.
     6. Relocate the parking lots near our sandy beaches, develop convienent shuttles. Tear up the lots and add the area to the beach.
     7. Actively encourage and financially support research into an economical (relatively) method for recapturing the sand lost to the deep canyons. We diver types can watch the sandfalls off Scripps Canyon.
     8. Outlaw the armouring of the coast, following any severe storm, damage insurance or disaster recovery payments from governmental agencies are payable only with the agreement to deed the property to the state.
     9. It will never be as beautiful as it was before the explosion in population but my main goal is an orderly withdrawl.
     10. The economy of California is sufficiently diverse that the cost of pulling back is not as great a threat as is is in Floida.

===message:The primary intent of the coastal policies I would implement would be to simply make it as unprofitable and undesirable as possible to reside/construct along the coast......

1) Raise, raise, raise property taxes along the coast. People hate taxes - an ingenious way to drive people from the coast. Revenues collected could be used for innumerable purposes - perhaps beach nourishment, maintenance, removal of armor, etc........ 

2)Force homeowners and businesses to carry adequate levels of hurricane/storm insurance - regardless of cost.

3)For homeowners/businesses that relocate at least x distance from coastline, offer incentives such as slightly reduced taxes and lower minimum insurance requirments.

4)Offer monetary assistance to those who wish to relocate but cannot afford to - establish guidelines to determine cutoff levels. 

5)Employ linkage to ensure compliance/enforcement - to counties/cities which fail to uphold/enforce said policies/regulations, reduce state funds in other areas - perhaps block grants or transportation funds or something.
 
6)Promote Iowa as the new hot spot to build a home or business. Provide tax breaks or other incentives to homeowners/businesses willing to relocate to this shrinking state. Ever heard of Iowa's Ocean - Rathbun Lake?

Epilogue:
After #6 fails miserably and if by some miracle this large coastal state approved enormous tax increases for many of its citizens, my term as governor would end quickly and painfully as I am mercilessly demeaned/ruined by my own party members for unpopular policies that alienated constituents.

I do realize how impossible my policies would be to implement - however, the best way to halt/slow construction on the coast and reduce the large numbers of people living in high risk coastal areas glaringly appears to be a slow process of making coastal living unprofitable, unaffordable, & undesirable. Then perhaps we can halt further damage to our coastlines and oceans and attempt to repair/correct our past mistakes.

For example, I would require that all real estate have an insurance plan, paid only by them, that could cover its own disaster relief.  Also, there would be strict regulations on the amount of coastal building in a certain area with minimal amount of beach manipulation (i.e. for erosion).  There would have to be a certain amount of coastal property that was protected by the nature conservancy.  Every couple of years there would be evalutaions on coastal property to ensure that they were complying to guidelines.  Regulation and supervision would be my motto.

Also, I would severely limit the use of all human construction that alters the surfzone:  groins, jetties, revetments, etc.  Last, I would make substantial increases in the budgets of researchers and research organizations to study the surfzone so we can better understand what it does naturally as well as what we have/are done to it.

However, I would not allow any new construction on the coast, and I wouldn't take the land away from those already living there when I came into office.  I would simply increase their property taxes, and stop subsidizing their loses, and ask congress to reduce FEMA's budget.  There would be restrictions put on the number claims a property owner could be compensated for. Drastically reduce recreational water sports: jet skiing, water skiing, speedboats, and etc.   Fees would be applied or increased for recreational sports in and out of the waters of the coast. After consulting with several agencies on coastal erosion, I would set policies determining how far back from the shoreline construction can take place.

What I would do, however, is promote situations such as the one in Seaside, Florida, as discussed in Against the Tide by Dean. I think bringing all of the development in-town, setting aside special areas as public beaches that bar any developlment,like in Seaside, would help reduce erosion rates and let the beaches go through their natural processes. I feel these towns would also benefit. In areas such as Myrtle Beach, SC, where my relatives live, the population has grown too fast. When my grandparents moved their in 1990, they averaged around 250,000 people on a normal summer weekend. Now they average over a million, and the development in the area is enormous. Traffic problems have lead to major delays, and people in the area are frustrated, but they refuse to move because it is such a nice area. By brining the towns further in-land, that beach traffic stays out near the beaches, and the towns still thrive during the summer from the business. While I do not feel that government should over-regulate where we want to live, in certain areas I feel it is necessary to preserve our beaches for the future. By buying these beaches, and moving all of the development inland, everyone can enjoy the natural pleasures of the beach, while not destroying the beaches and causing major damage during hurricanes.

Towns near these beaches would, of course, benefit economically, but would not be allowed to build up the new public beaches.  I would also try to educate the public about the reasons for my policies, that it is us building up the beaches that is a problem, not the beaches themselves.

===message:As governor, my main goal would be to establish sound policies to protect the beach and the people of the state that would not be overturned or ignored as soon as a natural "disaster" struck.  In "Against the Tide," Dean gave many examples of policies developed against beach armoring and subsidized insurance that were nullified at the exact moment when they should have been most effective because of pressure from the citizenry.   
<br>
One of Dean’s most effective points on this topic was in her discussion of the Supreme Court case when she said people should not demand compensation for obeying laws.  The state does have the right to establish zoning requirements to protect people’s lives and the natural resources that bring in tourists and protect the entire state from the effects of storms.  Therefore, I would enact legislation to cease the building of permanent structures within a certain distance from the shoreline and encourage the purchase of coastal property by the government or non-profit organizations.  Instead of subsidizing insurance for businesses and homes that are destroyed by storms and paying for them to be rebuilt time after time, my policy would be to purchase that land from its owners.  
<br>
While I am not an advocate of using taxes as a punishment, some places (Miami Beach for example) obviously require beach nourishment or other projects to protect already well developed regions and their residents.  Taxes should be scaled so that the people who benefit the most pay a larger percentage of the costs.   
<br>
Assuming my coastal state was at risk for hurricanes, I would also strictly enforce hurricane ready building standards.  Debris from badly built structures just increases the hazards to others.  Hurricanes are a fact of life in many regions and very simple building modifications can cut the insurance costs and possibly the loss of life.

Another item I would look into would be the raising of property taxes for coastal property by a few percentage points.  Maybe the money earned could be turned over to the above mentioned agency.  Also, new zoning laws should be put into place to restrict at least some building of commercial industries along the shoreline.  This could also decrease pollution and depletion of resources but harsher penalties and laws aimed toward pollution and conservation of resources would also be put into effect. I would then set up a community / state wide program aimed toward getting the people of the state involved in such things as fund raising, conservation, picking up trash and holding meetings and lectures to inform them of the dangers of building along the coast.

===message:Firstly, I think I would adapt on a state-wide scale some of the laws that the town of Seaside, Florida created: I would set strict zoning laws along the coast, setting the setback line very far.<p>

The zoning laws would require the buildings that are the closest to the coast to have height and square footage restrictions. A good side effect of this is that large, more permanent commercial buildings would not find these zoning laws very favorable, therefore this would decrease the amount of multi-million dollar commercial structures along the coast that would eventually cause problems, or have "moving" expenses to retreat from the advancing seashore.<p>

There would also be much higher property taxes on these coastal properties, which would be used to fund both extensive research into coastal and wildlife preservation, as well as be used to purchase more coastal public lands on behalf of the state, to be converted into natural preserves. There would be minimal facility developments, to minimize environmental impact on the coastal ecosystem, but to allow the general public to enjoy these lands. The more of the public that visits and enjoys the coastal lands, the more they see the need to preserve this habitat.<p>

Lastly, comes the issue of insurance. If private insurance companies absolutely will not insure the coastal developments, there would be a state-backed insurance fund. However, this fund would be sure to charge proportionally high premiums to enable the state to cover worst-case scenarios in the event of 100-year storms, without having to dip into the pockets of other state funds or put the state into debt.<p>

These policies should help preserve much of the natural coastline of my state, and provide for a beautiful shoreline. Also, property values should raise, much as they did in Seaside, because of the magnificant views available along my state's shores, and the tourism should also be another benefit to the state. Because of this, I would enact hotel & resort taxes for establishments that are within a certain distance of the coastline, and use those to fund coast-related programs, so that the people using the coastal resources the most are paying the most for them.

Only the maintence of current building structures would be premitted, and the building of small homes or business that would not have a major impact would be able to be built a least a quarter mile away from the coast. Larger buildings would be able to be built a mile and a half away from the shore.

The other half of my regin would be that no new development for undeveloped areas would be premitted at least a mile and a half once again for large buildings, and a half mile for smaller structers.

It is my opinion that many countries look at the US to watch what we are doing and then follow our lead.  It is not too late for us but we have already did alot of damage.

Many times the best ideas to keep the beach turned out to be the worse ideas and nature either destroyed the improvement or rendered it useless.  If I were making beach policy I would start with the idea that the beach cannot be held from change and the shoreline will move.  With this in mind I would install policies that would allow construction, but only structures that were built on pylons high in the air far enough back from the shore that the life of the building would be about the length of time before the shoreline approached it.  I believe this would be a balance between commercial and nature.  If a natural event changes this timeline then that is the risk the builder must face, because they know this will happen.  Groins would be outlawed, not only are they unsightly they appear to be destructive in ways that are not helpful.  Where bluffs are present a policy such as George Washington used with the lighthouse in the reading would be a rule.  Estimate the time the building will stand, estimate the time the bluff will last.  Build that far back.  Assume it will be eaten by the sea when that time runs out, no armor will be used.   The cost of these structures will be assumed as a depreciating item such as a piece of equipment,  as the day it will no longer exist grows nearer the value grows less.  When the ocean is allowed to function as it would without armor it may give us a better idea what really happens without our interference.  It will soon claim the armor that currently exist and with time it will become custom to build far back from the ocean to allow the ocean room the move and the beach to stay healthy.

 <p>NO Jetties, or groins are to be constructed! We will see that the Federal Government that strangle us (I am a Republican) pays for the damages done in the past. I will work with public officials of Batabano, our neighbors to the north, so we can work together in keeping the beauty of this land, and the economic welfare of the region.
<p> Farmers will not be forgotten, the county's environmental specialists will work with them as to assure they join in in the effort for our coast. We will help change farming procedures that are harmfull to the environment. Act locally, with native ideas, will be the motto of my administration. Money will not be a problem, as tourism dollars will pour in due to the pristine condition of our area's sorroundings. We also count with private investors that appreciate the growing need for "green" investments. The Federal Government has also promess to help in our coastal commitments.
 <p>Let's keep the beach, and the green lush around it that made our forefathers say "AWWWW"

===message:Depending if it is an election year or not and what are my constitutes and lobbyist are stating. If my constitutes are demanding major reform to implement on our beaches, then this woulld be of high priority on my legislator agenda. It also depends how hot the political topic is at that point. When Hurricane Andrew arrived in 1992,and destroyed homes and business and loss of lives,this was the hot topic in that election year. However, given the fact that there must be some rules and regulations concerning the coast and its users, I would  first organized a task force of experts who have studied and worked in this field and aked them to submit  6 plans  that would be cost effective, and safe to our citizens. I would then have my committee of staffers narrow the plan down to three and propose that it be sent to the legislators, and to the taxpayers for a vote. Most of these plans do cost the taxpayers money and the one that is most beneficial,safe, and least econimical would probaly win. I would state,in the plan that I would probaly chose, would not call for any jetties or more groins to be built on the beach, history shows that building these structures essentialy eliminates the beach. I would also chose the one that is more "beach friendly" one that does not call for buildings or homes to be built within " 5000ft" from the edge of the inlying beach area. I would not advocate from tourist atrractions to far from the  beach, but I would advocate from building right on the beach. Business and home owners should suppplement their own insurance when building with in a certain amount of distance from a potential natural disaster and should not ask the government to bail them out when their properties are destoyed.

===message:As Governor, the most effective way to deal with the problems of the coastal areas would be through education of the public.  It is impossible to implement legislation and have it succeed if the public does not buy in to the actions.  

I would create aggressive ad campaigns creating a public outcry for the preservation of our beaches and coastal areas.  With the public's support the local and state governments, as well as the national governments would be able to enact legislation based upon the latest research from the world's leading coastal specialists.

===message:If I became the governor of a coastal state, I would assume that there would already be severe damage to the beach.  Ideally, I would forbid any building near the beach but I would have to take into account that there would already be buildings there.  Since I could not simply take the property away I would propose the state start buying the property and start letting the beach heal.  Since this would obviously run into A LOT of money and take a lot of time I would start educating the public.  I would introduce a class similar to the one we're in now to public schools, and perhaps the state would start learning from its mistakes.  I believe ignorance is a big part of beach destruction and if people knew more about the damage they were causing maybe they would hesitate before building.  Unfortunately, the damage has already been done and this would not be an easy problem to solve.

===subject:Governor 
===message:If I were a coastal governor, I have many ideas I would put into place for successful coastal management.  I would make sure to have adequate public involvement in any proposed coastal management plan to ensure to all parties that a small influential interest group would not be the one steering policy decisions.  I would also recognize that many of my constituents would be coastal landowners, and many of them probably would be wealthy campaign donors.  It would be unrealistic to say that I would pay no attention to the interests of these people.  Therefore, whatever policy decision was reached would have to strike a balance between the environmental and human needs for the beach.  It must be clearly conveyed, however, that nature will eventually win the battle, and man must back off the coast at some point in the near future. I would establish a public awareness program, as well.  Perhaps by having coastal management worked into k-12 curriculum; at the very least, the state DNR or other agency would launch a major public awareness campaign.  <p>

I would establish some type of state beach monitoring commission to identify trouble areas and to make recommendations for viable solutions for such areas and to monitor projects already in place.  I would also make it clear that projects that were not working would be given a time frame in which they would either be made successful or abandoned.  I would not allow continued funding for unsuccessful prjects.  <p>

I would cap shore development at its current level and make sure that future development was behind a line that was a safe distance from the shoreline.  Structures presently in front of the line would be allowed to remain, but if destroyed or heavily damaged in a storm, they would not be allowed to be rebuilt.  The owners would, however, be allowed to recover insurance moneys and would be given a certain allowance to buy new property.  This method would be quite expensive, but I don't know how else to appease the wealthy beachfront landowners.  <p>

As far as armor goes, I would be very careful not to ban fixed structures altogether, as some are actually beneficial to costal management plans.  At the same time, I would not promote policy that encourages such structures as quick fix solutions to problems, as usually these hard structures simply pass the problem to someone down the beach.

===message:I do believe that construction on the coast should be prohibited.  Again and again, these constructions have failed-walls erected have eroded away, beach erosion increases with building of groins, and what do we do about it? We go out to fix the problem which we created by building more fixtures and this becomes a vicious cycle.
In Galveston, Cornelia Dean tells us that the city made a Faustian bargain.  The city put all their trust on a seawall, and paid dearly.
The way I see it, consruction of any kind should be at least some good distance from the beach, about three miles or more.  Then, good public transport system should be established to get people to the beach.  Alternatively, people can just walk-it is good exercise anyway.

===message:<p>There is no doubt that balancing the concerns of the diverse stakeholders in the Coastal Policy arena would be quite a juggling act.  It would be ideal to find a win-win solution that allows citizens to enjoy the beach without destroying the natural ecosystem that should thrive there.  Unfortunately, although the end is simple, the means to achieving this goal are extraordinarily difficult to agree upon.</p>
<p>A possible solution might be to place a tax on beachfront property owners.  The revenues produced by these taxes would be channelled to state environmental agencies charged with preserving and restoring natural beaches to the coastal areas.  Tax breaks would be provided to homeowners that volunteered community service hours to Natural Beach restoration projects.  Businesses would be eligible for tax breaks if they supported groups that worked towards the responsible removal of groins and other environmentally-negative, quick-fix beach hazards.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many dangers to implementing a tax scheme of this sort.  It might be difficult to determine at what level of community service a individual or organization becomes entitled to a tax break.  There are also very influencial and affluential people that are coastal property owners (beachfront property isn't cheap!) and this would undoubtedly make for some rough sailing towards this solution--in fact, it could equate to political suicide!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of those who own the beachfront property to maintain it for future generations.  An ancient proverb says that we "borrow the land from our children" but (unfortunately) most people in our post-modern society do not sense such a connection with the land, the beach, the ocean, or anything else so as to demonstrate responsible stewardship of these natural resources.

===message:If I were Governor I would institute a coastal policy of no commercial or residential building on the beach or within so many feet of it in order to preserve the personal value the beach gives to its visitors.  The only exception would be restroom facilities and drinking fountains.  I think in the long run a plan of keeping beach property off the market would pay for its self, because of community protection from the sea and less cost associated with paying for reconstruction costs after a storm.

===message:Although I would probably be chased out of office, I would opt to limit coastal development as much as possible.  I know, I know, this is another idealistic response.  But I would rather do this as opposed to the alternative of letting development continue.  Although the benefits of development are large there are too many costs (and headaches) that I would rather not have to consider.<br><br>

First, I assume that major storms/hurricanes will hit the coast at some point at a relative consistency.  Because insurance companies will take a smaller hit, I will probably have to rely on taxpayer money for a lot of the damage.  When I need to have inland taxpayers pay a large chunk of this bill, I will need to explain to the inland Joe why their family must give money to pay for damage a ways away on the coast (another headache).  In addition, the economy will slow and halt in some areas in the event of a major storm and it may take a while for many to recover (yup, headache).  I would have to evacuate towns nearest the coast, though many will dismiss my warnings, and probably have to over-evactuate when considerin worst case scenarios, causing another uproar (and headache).<br><br>

In addition to the occassional difficulties with storms, I will always have environmentalists battling with myself and other beachfront property owners (who are also mad at me).  When some area's beach inevitably erodes they will demand replenishment.  That means I will have to decide on the proper armor and have it installed.  However, I will hurt someone else's beach and have to fix this new problem by bringing in more sand.  And by the the time this project finishes, the beach I started with will be dry again and in need of more sand (owww, migrane this time).<br><br>
In short, I would rather not fight the ocean and coast and let nature run its course.  Although I will have a lot less revenue coming in, in the long run I will probably end up paying that much less in terms of settlements, subsidizings, programs, etc.  It seems to me that minimal development leads to less problems and conflicts down the road (and less advil for me).  I'd rather more taxpayers and businesses inland and have minimal impact by nature's course on the taxpayers.

===message:I am a big proponent of the park system, so I would like to turn as much coastline into a public parks, campgrounds, etc. as possible. Obviously this would ensure public access to natural resources without have some big real-estate war and more ecological pressure. I would also like to start a program like the CPR, but for coastal areas.  By rewarding landowners to implement conservation plans on highly erodable and highly vulnerable lands, the integrity of the marine ecosystem can be maintained.  As far as hurricanes go...I think a case of builder beware is good.  If the state is only willing to provide humanitarian assistance but not foot the bill to rebuild condos, developers will get the picture. (Especially if a tax creates a serious disamenity for overbuilding the coast.)

No one would be able to put up any form of drenches, that way everyone gets the same amount of sand and the amount that they were intended to get.

Of course, it is very important to make sure that whatever the laws, to do my best not to raise taxes, it isn't fair to the people not living on the coast to pay extra so that the people on the coast can live there, so another law would be that the people on the coast would have a little higher taxes.

===message:I believe the government should deture people from building on the coast by making it extreamly difficult to obtain building permits, making lot sizes huge, and large buffer zones between the beach and the strutures. Pass laws that all beaches are public areas. Limit the number of hotels,condos, and motels to help ease the evacuation routes in the event of an emergency. This would also ease the strain on the public utilities like water,sewer, and electricity. I realize this would be next to impossible in areas already over populated. In those areas increase taxes, make it hard to remodel/repair, Stop giving State and federal aid to rebuild. Maybe this would forse property owners to leave the beach and let it start rebuilding itself naturally.

That being said, I would have to make sure that there 
are beaches for people to come to.  First, I think that 
there should be a higher tax on businesses that are 
located along the coast/beach, especially if those 
businesses are manufacturing plants.  These tax 
dollars would be used to provide limited structural 
supports (if engineers deemed these necessary) and 
to provide much needed beach maintenance.  
<p>
Also, I would set limits on the number of new 
businesses that could be located on the beach.  A new 
business would have to be at least 600 yards away 
from the beach.  
<p>
I would also set in motion programs to restore the 
beach to its natural state without utilizing so many man 
made structures.  And limit areas acessible to tourist.  
And rotate those areas every few years.
