===message:I have been extremely lucky in terms of "coastal experiences". My grandmother lives in Mrytle Beach, South Carolina, and every year my family visits her and enjoys the beaches. In terms of this class, my favorite coastal experience would have been there in the mid-90's when Hurricane Bertha was a tropical storm out in the middle of the ocean. We were there about 1 week before it was expected to hit, and we went swimming and the temperature was about 85 degress-it was like bath water!!! Plus the waves were massive. After about 45 minutes I could not take anymore and had to come in because it was so powerful in there. I have also been to Daytona Beach, Florida, Venice Beach, CA, and Maui, Hawaii. All have been wonderful experiences, but I really enjoyed Maui the best. It is a little island of paradise, very peaceful and calm, especially in the night time. Venice Beach and Manhattan Beach are both in LA, and they are always packed with people, and the same goes for Daytona, which was not a very good experience! If anyone is near Mrytle Beach I would recommend checking it out-it is a beautiful beach, although there is plenty of coastal construction!!!!!

===message:Well, I have to say that my only real experience with the coast is the time I spent in Australia.  The water was nice and cool and clean I have to say.  I loved it so much down there, I am thinking about moving there one day permanently.  People there seem to really have a healthy respect for the beaches and the water (at least the people I was around).

===message:I have to say I haven't been lucky enough to have numerous coastal experiences.  My one and only experience was when I was 11 and my family went on vacation to California.  We stopped at a beach one day (I'm not even sure what beach).  However, my older sister kept singing the theme music to Jaws and telling me there were sharks in the ocean, so I didn't even get in the water! Hey-I was only 11!   If I ever do get the opportunity, I would love to visit the coast in Australia.  The Great Barrier Reef would be amazing to see in person.

===subject:Places I've Been
===message:I've been very fortunate to have traveled many places. I've lived on a lake my whole life and have a thing for water. My mother is 100% German and most of her family live in Germany, so I've been overseas every since I was a little girl. My Dad used to be a international businessman...so my whole life I've been traveling and I've also spent quite a bit of my college career in Spain.  I can't say that I have an all-time favorite  place or that one place was the most interesting, but I'll share a few of my most memorable experiences. <p> In Spain, near Gibraltar, is a town called Tarifa. It is in this town that I tried out my wind surfing abilities..only to fail :)It's one of the windiest places in the world (so they say)..with the flattest water. I was probably up on the board for a total of 10 minutes the entire time. From this wide beach, I could catch a glimpse of Africa. It was beautiful. From there I went to Tenerife, Canary Islands with 5 friends to surf. I'm not very good, but learning...I fell off my board and was pushed into an area of coral and got all scratched up. I still have the scars to prove it.<p> My favorite snorkeling experience was near Buck Island, off the coast of St. Croix ( U.S. Virgin Island) where I saw giant sea turtles swimming in the water. <p> When I was  a junior in high school, I was in Guatemala visiting my best friend (on the Pacific coast). I haven't been there since, but I still can't get the picture out of my mind. It was the first time I had seen black sand beaches and I was amazed. The sand was so hot!!
<p> One summer, I went to Alaska with my family  and saw huge glaciers and iceburgs coming out of the water. The next March, I sailed with my Dad and Grandfather from Acapulco to Costa Rica. It was the first time I swam in the water with dolphins.<p> I'm in Minnesota right now....too far from the ocean, but I'm going to Long Boat Key, Fl in a week to get my fix. It's addicting.

===message:I've only been to a coast twice, on visits to my boyfriend's parents' house in Havelock, North Carolina.  Clubfoot Creek runs past their back yard, which is a part of the Neuse River Basin, which, in turn, empties into the Atlantic.  I've been to Flanners Beach on the Neuse (which has signs warning not to eat anything from it because you may get sick).  That was kind of a gross area, with dead jellyfish washing up and the like.<p>  I've also been to Atlantic Beach, NC and the beach on Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks.  I thought they were pretty areas, though the beaches seemed kind of smaller than I had expected, and there weren't very many people at any of them when I was there.  I never got more than ankle-deep in the water because I can't swim.  Because I'd been there, I really enjoyed reading the sections in Against the Tide that talked about the Outer Banks, and Ocracoke in particular. <p>
I would like to see all of the Outer Banks sometime, but we weren't able to over spring break because of the limited ferry schedules at the time.  I would also like to visit New Orleans and Hawaii.

===message: Hmmm
<p> To pick one great experience would be extremely unfair. I can say that being born in an island I give kudos to the Sea, the coast, either reefy, or beachy. I treasure every moment spent at it with my family, unforgettable friends that I no longer see. The nights sleeping right over the sand, and under the stars, literally. The close encounter with a dolphin north of Naples, Fl and I mean a wild dolphin out of the blue getting his bottle nose right against mine, for several minutes, untill I hopped away so he may go. 
<p>The ocean is extremely strong, phisically, and therefore spiritually. You get to take it for granted when all you have to do is raise your head, and there it is, inmense and several kinds of blue. When you are in an island for as long as I was the sea, and the coast is just part of you. Maybe some of you really understand this.

===subject:Coastal Experiences
===message:There is not enough time to list them...smile.  I remember growing up along Galveston Island as a child and I can envision the barren dunes and salt grass on the western end of the island.  There was the occasional fisherman's shack on the bayside, always the bayside, of the island.  Cattle were grazing and egrets followed them in substantial numbers waiting on their next meal.  Roseatte spoonbills and white pelicans lined the shorelines.  Brackish marshes on the bay with freshwater ponds on the island filled waterfowl during the fall were a given reality.  The horizon was unbroken by anything but the movement of wildlife.  The sunsets were a swarm of birds returning from inland to the island where they spent their nights.  Today, there is a never ending procession of beach homes.  The marshes no longer have the depth or reach into the bay they once did.  The freshwater ponds, if you can find one, is typically filled with rubbish and is likely to show an oily sheen on its surface.  The occasional mottled duck still tries to raise a family but her nesting grounds have been destroyed by human intrusion.  Migrating waterfowl prefer to spend their winters in the less developed agricultural and coastal areas of Mexico, 400 miles down the coastline.  The State of Texas has done an excellent job of buying up remaining marshlands in a preservation effort, but what happens now is the crowding of too many birds in too few areas, during too short of a timespan, and the birds no longer visit the natural barrier islands as they once did because they can find no peace from human traffic.  They are subject to, and do experience, outbreaks of avian cholera and in years of reduced rainfall this can reach epidemic proportions.  The small, isolated, fishing shack has given way to $300,000 to $1,000,000 beachfront homes that are now listed as 4th row, 6th row, or 8th row from the beach.  The front row of homes are likely to be feet from the pounding surf line as erosion and natural migration of the island is moving inland. Islands we once hunted and fished in upper Trinity Bay have disappeared underwater.  The same happened behind my home on the San Jacinto River from the influx of saltwater into what was once freshwater areas.  There are few places on the Texas coast that I have not seen.  So many places, so many changes, in so little time.  My time in Florida taught me a new respect for our oceans.  The water in Florida can be considered pristine if compared to the upper coast of Texas.  The beneficial lack of intensive petrochemical production and impact is blatantly obvious, but so is the detrimental erosion from armoring.  Diving is a favorite pasttime of mine and I have dove the west coast of Florida and the Keys.  A late November dive in 1999 on a wreck put us within feet of 3 giant jewfish.  The dive operator, which I personally know, took us there specifically at my request so I could see these fish.  The estimated weights were 300 lbs., 500 lbs., and 900 lbs.  He also made me promise that I would never reveal their location because he feared someone would harass or harvest the fish.  To be eye to eye with a fish the size of a mini van, to hear and feel them drumming, is a humbling experience.  The smallest ones would play with us, leaving the wreck to swim away out over the sand bottom, only to silently return and stop within inches of our masks, where they would stay with us for minutes at a time before taking their proper place back on the wreck.  We left the wreck content in the knowledge we had experienced a touch of the past and the sadness that this has to be kept a secret from mankind.  Diving with the barracuda, nurse sharks, moray eels, schools of mackeral, african pompano, atlantic spadefish, and untold numbers of tropical reef fish in the Keys can teach respect for our resources and the beauty of nature.  But, when you witness divers who are not in control of themselves, standing on top of coral, disturbing silt, and picking up everything they see from the ocean floor, it is no wonder we have issues to deal with.  A part of diving that needs to be emphasized is ethics.  I have been lucky enough to spend some time on the island of Barbados and have some very dear friends their.  Its industry is sugar cane, the production of rum, and tourism.  Development is running rampant.  And it always strikes me as funny, when my Bajan friends tell me the American tourists are always coo'ing over the ancient buildings and not the modern motels, yet they demand air conditioning, swimming pools, and other non-Bajan necessities such as television.  The latest debate on Barbados was the addition of a tram or train that would encircle the entire island so tourists could hop on and ride the entire coastline.  Wouldn't that be some armoring!  Only the very wealthy live with air conditioned homes and automobiles.  It is a luxury most cannot afford.  A Bajan home is typically open to sea breezes and the only time a window is closed is during a rainstorm.  Their personal vacations are spent travelling to less developed islands where they can rent a small, unintrusive beachfront grass hut(s) for their families, as they too long for the days of less civilization!  My brief time there was wonderful and I look forward to the day I can return to the Caribbean and hopefully help them protect their environment from commercialization.  I have a long and deep-seated love for our coastal areas.  Even with the stories from our two books and my own personal experience, I remain hopeful that we can retain much of these remaining areas and with time, possibly even reclaim others.  These were just a few of my 41 years of experiences and with God's good grace, I intend to make a few more over the next 40 for myself before it's all said and done!  Capt. Dave

===message:Being a member of the military for over 35 years has allowed me to experience many unique experiences on beaches and oceans.  From the beaches of South Vietnam's ChuLai, and swimming in the South China sea, to Panama and seeing both oceans in one day, the Pacific and the Atlantic. I have swam off the coasts of California and the rode the waves in the Gulf. I have scuba dived in Panama and Mexico.  However, of all the beaches in the world the one most striking and contrasting, even with huge amounts of development, were the beaches of CanCun Mexico.  The sand is almost a pure white and the ocean a dark blue.  For any one who has been there will know exactly what I am talking about.  This beach and ocean, with its exotic coral deposoits,  seem to contradict everything in Colin Woodard's book "Ocean's End."  Nevertheless, I am certain beyond a doubt that given enough time this paradise of white sand and blue water will be polluted.  The one thing that seems to have made a difference on this strip of land are the stringent building codes the Mexican government has in place.  Hopefully, these regulations will allow CanCun to remain a paradise for vactioners in years to come.  Time will tell.

===subject:Coastal Experience
===message:One coastal experience that sticks out in my mind of visiting the Seychelles islands approximately 1500 kilometers due east of Zanzibar.  The islands stick out in my mind for a number of resons.  First, the beuaty of the beaches, vegetation, landscape, wildlife, etc. is breathtaking.  I parasailed for the first time and could overlook the magnificence of the whole island from above.  The snorkling was fabulous as there are over 900 species of fish and 100 species of coral to observe - much of which had the most brilliant colors I've ever observed.  I also visited the peace of Playboy Beach - named for reasons you cna guess.  Yes, Hef did a shoot there some years ago.  Now, I know why. <p>

The negatives of the Beau Valon Beach were twofold.  My friend Lynsy and I were beach walking when we stopped to take a dip and lounge on a couple large rocks about 40 feet offshore.  She was laying there, and I couldn't resist taking a picture because she looked so cute!  Unfortunately, she'd given me her cigarettes, lighter, and credit card to hold, as my rock was flatter than hers.  I'd set them down to take the picture, and just as I snapped the pic, a wind gust blew her items into the water.  Wouldn't you know that I recovered the cigs and lighter, but after 20 minutes of searching, the card was (hopefully) forever lost at sea.  Lyns and I got through that just fine.  A few hours later, however, a friend of ours who had a few drinks in him ran from the shore into the Atlantic and attempted to do a shallow dive.  A wave caught him just the wrong way as he attempted to do so and flipped him so that he went straight down in less than 3 feet of water.  He snapped his 5th vertebrate, leaving him paralyzed from the neck down.  He was flown to Johannesburg, South Africa, where he remained for three weeks, until he returned home to Boston.  He has recovered some use of his upper body, but it looks as though he'll never regain use of his legs.  <p>

This is just a reminder that coastal areas and beaches are some of the most wonderous features that Mother Nature has to offer, but we must always respect them for what they are.  Mark, unforunately, will pay the price for the rest of his life.  This isn't a very happy experience, but it is one of the most memorable coastal experiences I have had.

My aunt and uncle lived in michigan about a quarter miles walking distance from the beach of lake michigan (which was untouched) and I remember the difference between the two areas.  From the types of sand and the slope, the most vivid thing i remember was the water and how amazining clear it was at my aunts and uncles and how beautiful everything was with out groins and buildings everywhere.   The last time I saw an ocean was when I was six, and all I remember is seeing a dead jelly fish on the sand.  But, in one month from tomorrow I leave for the East coast, two weeks. Driving from Boston, to New York, to Baltimore, and D.C.  I may even see some of the beaches cited in "Against the Tide"  It will be my first time seeing a beach in a long long time and I think I will appreciate it much more because of this class...I know I will definitely notice much more in respect to what the beach looks like, what armor is present, etc.

===message:I am having a hard time picking what place is my favorite so I am briefly going to tell you about my favorite two.  Pennekamp (sp?) State Park in Key Largo, Florida is a beautiful place to visit or to SCUBA dive.  I was there last summer and spent the day diving in the coral reefs off the coast of Key Largo.  This place is a national park and it is protected by law.  This was my first time diving in the ocean so maybe this is why I like it so much.  A lot of the reefs were dead, but I saw lots of fish and a nursing shark, which I think is so cool.  I advise all of you to dive there when you get a chance! <p> My second most interesting place is where I am now, Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  I have never been around so many ocean loving people, it is wonderful.  There are hundreds of scientists here that are very serious about the ocean and want to see is protected.  The MBL, (Marine Biological Laboratory) is where I am working this summer and it has been a lot of fun.  There is so much research being conducted in so many topics.  Some times it is too overwhelming. This entire village (Woods Hole) is dedicated to marine research.  It is so crazy, to see every one very dedicated to such a field.  So if you guys get a chance visit Woods Hole and Key Largo they are two very interesting places.

===message:Having never truly been to a coast (with the exception of a brief visit to Florida's Atlantic coast, which I can hardly remember), I cannot say that I know a lot about what it means to be there.<br><br>

But, after taking this class, seeing the vivid images of calm, salty beaches of warm, soft sand being destroyed and violated makes me long for visiting what few havens we have left.  As a species of this planet, it appears that 'man' (gender neutral, of course...) has never been willing to cooperate with nature.  It's our way or no way at all.  In the end, though, it woudl seem that either nature will have the last laugh when we are far into our extinction, or we will destroy nature and therefore ourselves.<br><br>

In our ignorance, we have forgotten how to adapt to our environments like our animal kin on this planet.  Instead, we create and mold our environments to us.  Air conditioning, water purification, cotton and silk clothing... its all apart of man-playing-god that is destroying the world around us.<br><br>

In any case, before I get too off-topic, I would like to see the oceans of the world before they are dead and lifeless due to our ignorance and stupidity, and perhaps even make a difference by being educated.  Maybe, if those around us can become educated as well, we can make a difference and stop the insanity.  Otherwise, take a picture, since thats all that will remain after the beaches are long since gone.

===message:My junior year of high school, me and a bunch of friends went to a small town in Mexico called Puerto Penasco.  We rented a condo on the beach and spent a week there.  My first reaction to the place was that it was a tourist attraction, but those actually living there were obviously living in poverty.  From the time these kids were able to walk they were on the streets and beaches hitting any person they say up for money or trying to sell something.  Besides the poverty and countless distractions while trying to get a tan, the place was actually beautiful.  The food was excellent and the beaches were very nice.  Compared to the beaches onthe west coast, the water was cleaner and warmer.  Yet, looking back now I realize there wasn't much of a beach.  At "high tide" we didn't go to the beach because there wasn't one.  And when we did want to go to the beach we had to climb down man made walls.  Although at the time (and on a high schooler's budget) the trip was awesome, I probably wouldn't want to go back.  However, after seeing video #6, I wouldn't mind one day taking a trip out to Turk and Caicos.

===message:<p>A beach bum be I.  Though I go to school and spent much of my childhood in Iowa, I have not gone a single year of my life without some sort of costal experience.  As Schmidt labels it, I'm bi-costal.

<p>North Carolina has an amazing coast that is so unpredictable, fragile, and beautiful.  Much of my family lives in the state and I have been all over the coast.  We have a nice home a block from the beach in the middle of Emerald Isle (about 3 blocks wide).  My mother and her family have visited the island since the 1950s when their tiny cottage was one of the only homes on their part of the island.  In constructing our current house, we took precautions to preserve the natural environment by not clearing away vegetation (snakes love hanging out in our trees) and using friendly building materials.

<p>My West coast experiences include two summer internships that took me both to Seattle and San Francisco.  Throughout both opportunities, I traveled up and down the West coast, fascinated by the sharp cliffs and rocky beaches that distinguish it from the East coast.

<p>One of the most interesting places I visited was along the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Washington (where the Pudget Sound connects with the Pacific) in a town called Port Angeles.  At the end of the town a long jetty struts out into the ocean.  In the harbor-like area created by the jetty sit hundreds of logs waiting processing by the seaside sawmill.  The saddest sight I saw while visiting the area once was a seal that had attempted to cross the jetty on land by strolling (if seals can stroll) across the road running down the jetty.  Instead of connecting with the chilly kelp infested waters on the opposing side, the seal collided with a tourist's automobile.  Around the dying seal sat tourists.  Some were seeking help, others sadly took pictured in the typical tourist way.

<p>Northern California's coast is amazing.  At any point on Highway 101 between San Francisco and Santa Cruz one can stop at the roadside parks and be assured a spectacular sight.  The aquarium in Monterey offers an unprecedented look at the underwater happenings of the area.

<p>My only other distinct coastal experience involves a recent trip to Costa Rica's Pacific coast.  The point in which tropical rain forests run up against the coastline provides you an opportunity to find beautiful beaches that only inhabitants include your travel companions, yourself, and countless lizards and monkeys basking in the sun.  The beaches were amazing, but the industrialization of Costa Rica must inevitably be a threat.  The crowded pollution of Costa Rica's capital San Jose hopefully will not be transmitted to the coastline.  Signs already indicate this may be the case.  The beach at Jaco, once a world renown vacation spot, is now polluted and dirty.  We heard horror stories from other travelers who had visited Jaco.  One can only hope that the growth of Costa Rica's technology, the largest software producer in Latin America, and ecotourist industries will provide environmentally sound economic alternatives.

This side faces toward and right off of the mainland. On the other side of the island that touches the Atlantic, there are very very few hotels, cliffs, miles and miles of beaches, forests and vegetation. I asked my dive instructor why noone dove on that side and he explained to me that the currents were too strong and the waves too strong for any dives to happen over there, and was the reason there were few people over there. The funny thing was that the side that had been untouched looked more accompanying than the side where tourism was the greatest.

Well, I decided to get the tube, and jumped off of the ski into the water, the shore was about 50 feet away.  I thought I had plenty water under the jet-ski, but there ended up only being about 2 feet of water, and I ended up sinking right into the coast.  Only my legs got stuck, I and got free eventually, but it was just funny to me, plus it's the only coastal experience I could really think of.

===message:Well, the only coastal experience in terms of being on the ocean would be when my friends and I went to Negril, Jamaica for spring break last year. We went on a booze cruise and went snorkeling plus there was cliff jumping which I couldn't quite get enough drinks in me to accomplish but I did go down a slide into the water which was pretty high up.  The beach was beautiful and my most favorite times were walking along the shore at night with our shoes in hand and drinks in the other.  It was a very laid back atmosphere but sometimes it was a little overwhelming because of the locals always bartering and hassling you.  All in all though we met a lot of great people and had a blast.

===message:I am very fortunate, the Atlantic Ocean is onle about 18mi. away from my home so I have many great memories. Some of my favorites are the camping trips to Hammonasset Beach State Park in Connecticut. My wife, 6yr old son, and I spend 9 days camping there every summer. It is not too commercialized  yet. The park is about 1000 acres, has bike and rollerblading trails, a nature center, an ice-cream stand (my sons favorite stop) and an amphitheater. There is a nice board walk that we watch the 4th of July fireworks from. The beach is about 2 mi. long, it has nice dunes with salt marshes in back of them.  I hope when my son is grown up he can still enjoy the beach the way we do now.
