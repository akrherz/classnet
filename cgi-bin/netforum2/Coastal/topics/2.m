===subject:Habitat Degradation, the biggest problem for coastal areas
===message: There are many coastal zone problems facing the United States and the world. The electronic reader explained that some of the diverse problems of coastal areas range from the pressing problems of coastal pollution and habitat degradation, to the long-term implications of changing sea level.  I think all of these suggested problems are very important.  However, I also think that one of these issues leads to many other problems.  Habitat degradation is the biggest problem we face today.  By constructing buildings on the coast as humans we destroy the physical and biological beach communities, and then when we realize the negative impacts we have on these beaches; we try to fix them by engineering various armor.  

Let me explain more what I mean by how habitat degradation leads to other problems.  When humans build elegant hotels on the beaches many times they destroy the sand dunes, which contain plants that hold the sand together.  When these dunes are destroyed there is no longer a natural barrier to wind and storms.  The "loose" sand is eroded away and beaches start to disappear.  Many times armor is built, like walls and jetties to protect the beaches, but this only makes it worse and the material pollutes the water and land.  This is how habitat degradation leads to pollution.  

Another problem associated with destroying habitats is the rising sea levels. If natural beaches are destroyed then we won't have a natural barrier to the rising sea levels. The sand dunes and salt marshes could help soak up some of the extra water but only if they are present. Coastal engineers will try to invent something to protect coastal areas but Mother Nature will eventually destroy it.  

Ultimately habitat degradation destroys the living spaces for numerous plants and animals.  Sea turtles are the most popular example since most of them are endangered and are heavily dependent on natural beaches to lay their eggs.  Another important issue to bring up is biodiversity.  When these habitats are destroyed it limits the diverse flora and fauna of a region and creates a more uniform community. This leads to even more endangerment since many organisms are dependant on each other in the magnificent food web.

Habitat degradation causes so many problems. This is why I feel it is the biggest and most important issue for coastal management organizations like ICM.  To manage coastal problems you have to get to the root of the problem and habitat degradation is a good start.

===message:In my opinion, the biggest problem facing the US and other countries’ coastal areas is that too many people are trying to do way too much with such an unstable landscape.  The world’s great cities are mainly all located, largely by economic and strategic necessity, near a coast.  In the US alone, 80 percent of Americans are within an hour of a coast.  Nature has its own method of protecting and replenishing the sands of beaches through wind and water currents and storm patterns.  Humans create structures along shorelines and just offshore for entertainment, housing, businesses, transportation, etc. that prevent nature from doing its job efficiently.  Consequently, over time, our ability to create such man-made generations is slowly eroded away.  These days, it seems easier for the average person to be ignorant by choice than to be preventative or proactive and look for long-term solutions to problems such as coastal erosion, pollution, and destruction.  People are more interested in making a living and living comfortably now than they are concerned with the future of coastal zones for their children.  Therefore, the answer to our coastal areas’ problem lies in the ability of conscientious and concerned citizens, students, scientists, journalists, politicians, environmental groups, and the like to convince an ever-growing coastal population that it is in everyone’s best interests to prevent serious property damage and loss of life by having a wide, healthy beach.  Unfortunately, given recent coastal migration and development trends and the current national political focus, that convincing may not be possible until it’s too late.  As Dean's book stated, much of the public and political attitude when crunch time hits today is "save the buildings not the beach."

===message:In my opinion, the fact that so many people are unaware of the potential danger surrounding coastal policies is our biggest problem. Due to the constant efforts of those involved with promoting environmental safety, most of us in the United States are aware of our activities that put our water, air, and animal and plant life species in harms way (Some countries are far ahead of us in environmental policies and regulation, others are behind). Thus we have academic courses on Environmental policy in the political science and biology/other scientific academic fields. Plus environmental politics have become a major factor on some politicians agendas, so we are naturally aware of some of the principles involved. But before I signed up for this course and began the readings and lecture videos, I had NO IDEA about coastal policies-the thought had never crossed my mind! When I thought of environmentalism I thought of recycling, protecting the atmosphere, don't litter, ect... (The everyday stuff our generation is now taught in school). Now, many of us will be aware of these issues, but that is in the academic field. What about the billions of people across the world who do not have access to information such as this? Thus, I think all of us take our coastal areas for granted-I know I have-without ever thinking of the consequences. I think right now the number one problem facing those who want to further the cause of coastal policies is that people are lack the knowledge of how these areas are affected by our decisions/actions. Therefore, the number one priority for those in the field should be promoting awareness.

===message:Population and overgrowth are undoubtly the biggest problems facing the coastal areas of the world.  According to the video 75% of the world's population lives within 60 kilometers of the coast.  This number is incredible and as the world's population increases the number living near the coast will only increase.  However, there is only so much land available and as man as proven in the past he is not the best "caretaker" of land and therefore the probabality of polution is extremely high.  Even beaches and bodies of water have been destroyed, or polluted, from places as far away as "Iowa."  Constant runoff of farm fields has caused the gulf near New Orleans to become absent of fish.  They call this area "the dead zone."  In the future man has to do a better job of taking care of the environment.

===subject:Biggest Coastal Problem...No love for geomorphology!
===message:Hello everyone,

It's interesting for me to view these Coastal Policy issues with a soil science background, but that is what I have, so...I will not hesitate to say that a lack of general knowledge about geomorphology and a specific lack of geomorphological information taken into account by policy makers and planners is really at the heart of all of the pressing coastal problems mentioned thus far.

Geomorphology and landscape genesis are vitally important factors which shape any landscape - long before any kind of human intervention. Without specific information about the history of a landscape (how it was formed, factors affecting its development, its stability, relative age, etc) merely following a generic coastal development model cannot produce site-specific solutions in places that encompass such wide classifications as histic, volcanically derived, quaternary, or fluvial in origin. Understanding these factors enables one to make determinations about everything from appropriate waste management to types of plants that may thrive in that particular soil. (Oh, and sand, as in the beach sand, is technically soil, from a soil science perspective.)

All habitats and human structures are intimately tied to the geomorphology of the region, and until local planners as well as government officials can employ a level of professional geomorphology expertise, decisions will continue to be made without even a fundamental understanding of the region's environmental origins.

Check out this nifty geomorphology link from Wisconsin on their project in the Gulf of Mexico.

===message:Greed and ignorance are the biggest problems facing global coastal areas (and US coastal areas in particular).  I think most people think the beaches are there for their own enjoyment, and assume they always have been there and they always will be there.  I don't think most people have ever considered how beaches form and reform, and what conditions are needed for a beach to maintain itself.  If they do hear about problems facing coastal areas, they (a) assume it isn't really the big deal it's made out to be, (b) assume someone else will come up with and implement a solution (which better not hinder their personal enjoyment of the beach!), (c) don't have the ability or foresight to think in the long-term and really grasp the implications of the problems.  Plus, I think too many people have the attitude that someone else can change their ways and make it all better, but they don't want to modify their own behavior!  This goes for both people wanting to live on the beach and businesses wanting to profit from it by building it up.  No one wants to be inconvenienced or have something pleasurable taken from them.

===subject:Discussion #1 Biggest Coastal Zone Problem
===message:I spent my youth 35 miles from Galveston, Texas.  I proposed to my wife on the very seawall discussed in Chapter One.  There is little of the island that I have not seen, from beachfront to the bayside.  The majority of my life has been in or near "coastal zone" regions of the Gulf Coast.  I just recently returned to the midwest from a three year stay on the west coast of Florida near Clearwater.  

Being blessed with growing up on the upper Texas coast, I was able to enjoy the recreation the area offered.  I have also been able to see many of the changes or impacts of human encroachment and utilization of this same area.  The home I grew up sits atop a ridge overlooking an old offshoot of the San Jacinto River just north of the Houston shipping channel, for oceangoing vessels, and approximately one mile as the crow flies from the San Jacinto Battlegrounds.  When we first moved there the river below the house was predominantly freshwater.  We caught many catfish, bluegill, and freshwater drum from our backyard.  I was eleven when we moved to this house.  Just a quarter mile across the river was an artificially created island that was used as a spoil dumping ground when the shipping channel needed dredging.  This island was approximately two square miles.  It was a wonderful place to spend a day.  There were two natural inlets that had penetrated the encapsulating dike from storms and the cleaner freshwater coming downstream from Lake Houston allowed vegetation to take root inside the island itself.  The interior was a maze of islands and emergent vegetation that became a haven for migrating waterfowl each fall.  Outside the two inlets, one only need a single cast with a net to have all the one to three pound mullet necessary for a days fishing.  And sitting on our small pier we could catch channel and blue catfish until we were tired of them.  By the time I had finished high school in 1979 (showing my age now) and after several dredgings of the channel, changes began to occur from the intrusion of saltwater from the coast.  The shipping channel authority had the two inlets closed and reinforced.  The interior marshes and vegetation died out in shortorder.  The emergent rushes surrounding the dike disappeared.  The small islands and stands of willows outside the dike, likewise disappeared.  We began to catch redfish, speckled trout, croaker, and saltwater catfish.  The river offshoot that once supported high-speed Sunday afternoon boat races and water skiing began to silt in.  Increased barge traffic brought an oily sheen to the area and further silting by their 24 hour a day usage.  Mother nature brought us Hurricane Alicia in August of 1983 and the resulting shoreline damage and build up of sediment over in the riverbottom was staggering.  We lost approximately 70 feet of shoreline as there was no vegetation other than St. Augustine grass on everyone's lawns for protection.  Riprap instantly became the next barrier from all landowners after this storm.  The river depth shallowed so much that it halted tug and tow traffic, which now only operate out of newly constructed terminals near the shipping channel.  If I would be brave enough to wade through the oil-stained waters and could support myself in the three feet of bottom muck, I could walk across the river to the main island as its average depth is five feet or less now.  Waterfowl no longer visit the river system or the island in what once could only be described as clouds of birds in the 1970's.  Local conservation officers told me at one point in the mid-80's that the island had now developed a problem with avian botulism and no waterfowl should be consumed if harvested there.  They were not on the island to enforce hunting regulations, but to inform hunters to not harvest the game and to burn all of the clothing they had used on the area.  An area just north of the Battleship of Texas was a tremendous alligator gar fishing spot during my high school years.  These fish can no longer be found and are forced to stay in the habitat just below the dam at Lake Houston.  What once were 200 pound fish are now below 60 pounds and it is assumed their forage has also been minimalized by the water and habitat change.  As a licensed US Coast Guard Captain (Merchant Marine/Charters not military) I spend a lot of time on the water, wherever I am.  As you can imagine, it is hard for me to go home.

A person only need fly over the area on a flight into Houston Hobby's airport.  The turbid waters of Trinity, Galveston, and supportive bay systems all show the impact of the shoreline petrochemical industries and turbulence of the oceanbound shipping traffic.  The water and air quality of the area are some of our nations worst.  The effluent from human use clearly wears a face that can be seen by the most uninformed person if they simply look.  

My brief three years in my beloved Florida hold a different tale.  For the waters of Florida are gorgeous when compared to the perpetually brown stained waters of the upper Texas coast.  Here the water quality can be superb, offering underwater visibility to ranges of nearing 150 feet in the keys and 80 feet off of Clearwater.  Flying into a Florida airport you can see the ocean floor for many many miles as you approach the coastline.  Florida suffers under the relatively recent developments of American lifestyle, mobility, wealth, and subsequent desire for recreation.  An increase in overall wealth and a higher emphasis placed on personal satisifaction has lead our population to seek such areas of recreation as our nations coastlines, that are closer to home, i.e. we are moving to the water.  This rather quick growth is suffocating Florida and other state's natural areas.  It can't be argued that the immediate problem is anything other than the developments on such a fragile ecosystem, but a real issue confronting this and the rest of societal issues is simply the human self-interest in consumption without regard for the consequences.  This is not an American trait, but a human one.  

Positive legislation is needed to protect us from ourselves, as there is honestly not one of us who would not love to see that beach or ocean view each evening, as we sit on the deck and ponder how lovely life truly can be.  The ocean draws us as much as our strongest human need, that of love and understanding, and it is up to all of us to responsibly work with each other so we benefit all ecosystems and species on the planet, humans included.

Every country depends on their coastal areas to carry their economies.  So when it comes time to choose between keeping up with the competitors or protecting the environment and possibly losing money, companies and countries choose to set aside the known long term affects that pollution and overuse has on the area and just focus on the immediate profits available.  It is a constant international battle similar to that over world emissions standards; who has been damaging the environment the longest, the most, and who is going to be the one to take the first economic hit and set the example of fixing the problem rather than hoping someone else will fix it for them.  It comes down to the fact that everyone knows what is at risk and that damage is being done to the coastal areas, but no one wants to stand up and say I'll help for fear of what those around them will do to them, specifically those prospering the most from the activities that are damaging the coasts.

Some would say get off the beach, but if they do without effective legislation somebody else will just settle down in thier wake to take advantage of the resources left behind.  Is this greed?  I don't think so.  The world is oppertunistic, and resources left unprotected or unused will be used by somebody eventually so labling them greedy will not stop anything for they don't consider themselves greedy.  The problems seem to be laced with missinformation and politically posturing.  The solutions filled with sacrafice and good guesses as to what might happen with people pointing fingers and the ocean continuing its steady advance forcing the issues to the front.

===message:The biggest problem that is happening in the coastal zones from my point of view from the video, the reading on the internet and the reading from chapter one is people moving to the coastal areas and developing man made industries on the beach and the coastal areas.  Because of the more people moving to the coast they are hampering the structure of the beach and the coast.  So by doing this they destroy the national protection that the coast have.  When the government decides to protect the natural surroundings of the coast they are a little late because people have move there and prospered on their own, without knowledge of what they are doing to destroy the coastal zones.  Thus in conclusion the biggest problem is people moving in the coastal zones and the governments duties to protect it.

Our economy is a deep and rich base which upholds our nation and allows for it to grow. Unfortunately, with the economy grows industry and business. In coastal regions, industry uses the coast as means for shipping overseas, and in some cases uses the water as means for cooling. As far as businesses, some of the most populated areas are near the coast; thus the more people the better the business. I believe our biggest problem are the lack of laws protecting the coasts from overpopulation and over-industrialization in order to protect the growing environmental concerns regarding coastal areas.

Earth science classes are about building a volcano and environmental classes tend to be "Don't litter" (as was already noted) and "save the rain forest, whales..." Since coastal processes happen over geologic time spans, in any human lifetime an individual part of the coast may not change radically or be hit by a great storm. So how is a person to evaluate a danger they have never experienced. There are many cryings by the environmental wolf and years go by with no harm. An additional point is about the economics. The true cost of environmental damage should be paid over time. Instead we wait and then remediate. If the "government" would not permit rebuilding on damaged sites as a condition for aid, the true cost would be better understood. Hilo, Hawaii followed this type of program when they suffered a great tsunami. The city bought up all of the damaged properties and the resulting cleared land became tsunami park.

Although the implications of seawall development wasn't clearly known at the time the one at Galveston, Texas was developed, today we can see that seawalls do more to harm Nature's natural beaches and the normal processes they undergo over time.<p>

I guess I would have to say one of the major problems facing the coastal areas is that the demand and high value that has been placed on the coastal areas by both commercial businesses and residential developments is causing a cycle that will be very hard to break, and the fact the many people with coast-line property are also in the rich upper class that can influence their legislators to be more lenient in regulations regarding coastal zone developments, and they will do everything they can to convince their representatives to not pass laws that would hinder their current practices of developing huge areas of coastline into resorts, etc.<p>

We will need to take back much of our coastal areas, probably somehow by the government buying and holding that land as a national park or preserve in order to prevent further development, but much of the current property needs to have houses, resorts, and businesses moved off of it so that a wide beach can be developed to help Mother Nature heal herself, but this will be very hard to do, since people will not want to easily turn over their currently high-valued property.<p>

It seems to be too big of a monumental task to correct the mistakes that have been made for a long time now, to restore the beaches back to their normal, self-replenishing and dynamic selves.<p>

Discussion 1

     Dean?s description of the Galveston Texas hurricane of 1900, and its aftermath, provides a fine introductory case study for those involved in coastal management.  According to Dean (1999), Galveston Texas was devastated by a severe hurricane resulting in the worst natural disaster in our nation?s history in terms of loss of human life.  

     This post-discussion addresses the question, ?What?s the biggest coastal zone problem??  My initial gut response to this question was that there may be no ?one? problem but several.  After giving this question some considerable thought, ?I may be wrong.? Before beginning, I would like to address the following factors contributing to the vulnerability of Galveston Texas during the hurricane of 1900. 

      Factors contributing to the vulnerability of Galveston Texas in 1900 include: 1) Galveston?s being only 9ft. above sea level, 2) relatively high population and supporting housing and community infrastructure (e.g., docks, ports, businesses etc. eroding protective dunes and beaches), 3) the lack of an early warning communication system and related civil defense plan that allows for the effective evacuation from a danger area. 

     First, being only a few feet above sea level (as with most coastal cities, e.g., Florida avg. six ft. above sea level), Galveston was simply not elevated enough to stand the sustained storm driven waters (16ft.) and 120 mph winds. Houses and businesses were not designed or built to stand such an onslaught resulting in Galveston?s heavy loss of life and property.

      Secondly, human impact such as housing and business developments eroded the beaches and dunes that would usually provide protection to coastal cities in adverse weather conditions.  This loss of protection allowed the waters to simply roll across the landscape unimpeded.

     Lastly, the lack of an early warning communication system and related civil defense plan that allows for the effective evacuation from a danger area was simply not in place.  I realize that advanced weather tracking and warning technologies didn?t exist at that time but they did have some idea that a storm of gale force was headed in their general direction.  Like today most people of Galveston and their leaders probably ignored the possibility that a life-threatening severe storm could hit.  And it did! After realizing that their lives were in danger the people realized the needed to evacuate to the mainland only to find out their only means to escape was washed away.  Perhaps a second bridge to the mainland would have helped.  But this is hindsight. 

     Long story short.  After this disaster it was believed that by raising the elevation of the island of Galveston, adjusting the slope and contours of the island and constructing a sea wall the city would be safe from future disaster.  And it did work for a while.  During the hurricane of 1917 the seawall was an effective measure. Unfortunately seawalls like these lead to passive erosion and often accelerate the loss of beach, as Galveston would learn later.

     Why this long explanation?  By exploring these contributing factors to the vulnerability of Galveston I have gained insight into ?the biggest coastal zone problem? facing us today.  Although there are many problems facing coastal areas, such as human impact and population, rising sea levels, pollution, and natural phenomena (e.g., hurricanes), these problems are often the result of human activity.  I suggest that the biggest problem facing our coastal areas today is people and our inability and /or unwillingness to learn from our mistakes.  Our desire to live next to the coast coupled with our egotistical belief that we can ultimately triumph over or improve on nature usually comes with a high price that usually benefits only a few in our society.  Is there any resolution to this problem?  I doubt it. Our inability and /or unwillingness to learn from our mistakes may be rooted in our psyches.  Let me explain.  

      It takes a special person to be a leader.  They provide the inspiration for others to believe that they can achieve certain goals and ideas. After the Galveston hurricane of 1900, the leaders were determined to rebuild instead of moving to the relative safety of the mainland.  Why? Is nature evil?  Should we fight nature instead of working with it?  It?s as if the leaders of Galveston thought that by resettling on the mainland that this was an admission of some kind of defeat.  Not in my mind.  But this kind of never-give-up mindset coupled with the average persons need to follow may significantly contribute to a cycle of construction, destruction and re-construction (e.g., as seen in the reconstruction and subsequnt decline of galveston after the hurricane).  

     In closing, I believe our shortsightedness and our destructive attitudes toward nature perpetuates a cycle of construction and destruction on our environment that we never learn from.  Apparently, human memory is short.  Or it may be that we have the mentality of children in that ?if we don?t think a bad thing will happen, it won?t, happen.  It?s a typical human mindset but a dangerous one. Given our increase in population and current consumption, the self-renewing mechanisms of nature may ultimately fail us in the near future.

===subject:Coastal Problem
===message:I think that the worst problem facing coastal areas is the inability to educate the people living in coastal areas about the damage they are doing to the ecosystem.  By ignoring warnings about destroying coastline and even ruining their homes, people continue to build enormous houses right next to the shore.  When the ocean rips away at their houses, they destroy the beach even more by erecting groins and other such devices to trap sand.  When these fail or backfire, they cry for help from the city, state, and/or federal government.  This needs to stop.  Heavier restrictions need to be placed on coastal building, and residents need to be shown the results of other people's attempts to "repair" the beach.

===message:i never realized how many people lived on the coast.  i 
think that many people take this for granted, and that 
they dont know how lucky they.  of the 75 percent of 
people living on the coast i dont think that very many of 
them realize that the coast is in danger.  people 
continue to build on the coast despite the threat of 
disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes.  
people need to be informed as to what might be lost.  
the only way to stop the coast from being damaged is 
prevention.  The states should pass certain legislation 
to regulate how much building continues to go up.  the 
coastal problem affects more than just the people on 
the coast.  many industries such as fishing that are on 
the coast provide resources to the rest of the country.  
therefore not only should the states be responsible for 
preserving it, but also the federal government.  
organizations need to ban together to keep on the 
government to help keep our coasts.

===message:The biggest problem with our coasts is human consumption.  Sure the coastline in many areas is eroding, but that's a natural process.  The process is only quickened when we try to control it for our own selfish gain.  Based on what I've read thus far, and the information I've either seen or heard there's doesn't seem to be anyway of stopping the erosion process.  It's the way the natural order of the sea is supposed to be.

===message:The biggest problem facing coastal zones is the idea that perserving them is not important. There are many things that contribute to destroying coastal beaches, but perhaps none more than the attitude that surrounds it. Let me use an example to illustrate this. For me, personally, I never thought about the problems inflicted upon the coastal zones, and to be honest, if I hadn't moved to North Carolina this summer, I probably would of went through this class treating it just as such, instead of giving myself the opportunity to develop some of my own views. But down here, things are different. You can't turn on the evening news without getting a hurricane watch, and you can't open the paper without seeing an article about perserving the beaches. In Iowa, protecting coastal zones isn't something that I would of talked about. In North Carolina, it's talked about everyday. Much of the attitude here is the same as it is anywhere else, but it's the education that's different. With much respect to the books we're reading for this class, I've learned more about coastal politics by experiencing some of the fears and disbeliefs some people go through down here and by living with a college professor who has a real concern about this area of study. So although many things can contribute to the distruction of coastal zones, the biggest problem is the lack of education and ignorance that causes those problems in the first place.

===message:It is in my opinion that lack knowledge has in the past been the biggest coastal problem.  

Living in Iowa we do not hear very much about coastal issues, yet for many of us our idea of a vaccation is relaxing on a white sandy beach.  After reading about Miami and how they insisted on making a beach to replace the one that was washed away I am sure we as travelers add to the problem.  Miami wanted tourist dollars and they felt with out the beach they would suffer, that seemed to be their only priority.

If knowledge about our coastal beaches were widespread would that change anything?

===message:The biggest problem facing our beaches seems to be us - people. Too much construction on the coast and too many people living in these areas creates nearly every problem beaches face. As Cornelia Dean has made clear, there are no erosion problems where there is no building on or near the beach. Attempts by people to protect their buildings & property or "correct" erosion through armouring only accelerates erosion problems. Pollution of the oceans, destruction of wildlife and their habitats, depleted fishing resources - all problems created by humans not taking enough care to protect the environment in which they live. Even the problems created by approaching hurricanes and other storms are of human creation - because there are too many people living along the coast, too many large, immovable, or poorly constructed buildings and homes, problems arise in regards to evacuation routes & coordination, damage to homes and property, insurance and economic problems, and injury and death. Perhaps mere carelessness, or ignorance in thinking that we may do what we wish to the natural environment and never deplete our resources or create any significant harm, is the greatest danger of all.

  It seems to me that biggest problem about coastal areas damage is the human reluctancy to loose what has been harnessed, and is now enjoyed. To up-root towns, buildings, and corporations, is not only politically suicidal; but we ourselves are not ready to face the grim reality.Sure overpopulation in the coast plays a major role, but moving the cities inland is not going to resolve the situation. If say, New Orleans, was to be emptied out; it's population moved away, the leeves brought down, there is still the whole Mississippi watershed to go after.
  Can the U.S. and the world economy afford the decrease in production of grains, and other staples that we are so used to, and are results of the same technologies that have killed the Bayous? Perhaps we could rely some more on biologically altered products(which we are in the process of), but European leaders keep playing these "health concerns" games when in fact all they are doing is waiting for them to develop their own system and be able to compete.
 The U.S. Corp of Engineers actions should definately be harnessed, and held them account for damages done. Let's also bring into consideration that what might be revolutionary today can be proven nefastus tomorrow, specially in environmental matters.
 The main problem affecting the coast is us, human beings. Human progress is sadly attached to change, and very often necessary destruction.

===message:After reading Against the Tide and looking at the videos,the biggest problem along the coast of our nation is human greed to fight against human nature. Our beaches are made naturaly and we are destroying a great work of nature by building homes,business,and entertainment venues to satisfy our fantasy with a birds eye view of heaven on earth (the ocean). We must protect our beaches and wildlife by not rebuilding and building next to the beachfront. Concrete barriers miles long not only erode our coast by limiting the growth and regrowth of the beach, but most are an eye soar and take away from the beauty of mother nature.

We have learned that building seawalls impedes the progress of beachlife, this is noticable in Galveston where the beach is getting smaller because of the armoring. As noted in the reading "once a beach has been stabilized,it will always remain in a stabilized state at an increasing cost to taxpayers. Thus human greed is the major problem in the battle of saving our coast. Let the beaches remain wide and free!

===message: The biggest coastal zone problem is man and his activities.  In his persuit for happiness, man will cut down trees to build houses, this causes soil erosion.  Man will clear the mangroves to build hotels and condos, causing problems to micro organism who dwell in them and also causing the disappearance of beaches.  This short time happiness will turn to tears when storms come and floods become rampant.
   In Galvestown for example,sandunes that might have offered some protection during floods had been dug and used to fill low places in the city's business district.  The city paid dearly for this when the storm of 1900 came.
   However, man cannot be taken out of the equation.  More research need to be done, and businessmen educated to understand not to meddle with the coastal zone.  A balance has to be reached so that man and the beach can at last live in harmony.

===message:There are several problems with coastal zones, but whatever the problem, it seems to come back to people living on the beaches.  People building houses on beaches, erosion of the beaches not being even, and other things like that.  People build their houses on beaches, then using drenches to give more beach to them, taking more sand from other people.  Beach erosion was discussed in the first chapter of "Against the Tide."  The only thing that I think could help would be to put more restricts on living on the beach and to educate the people living there and moving on to the beach

===message:In my opinion the number one problem facing coastal areas is definately people.  Whether causing the destruction of beaches through sea walls, jetties, and groins or causing "dead zones" through pollution, humans are the main threat to the world's oceans.  Policy makers need to stop catering to monied interests and start enacting policies to help protect the ocean.

===message:<p>I cheated.  I am answering this discussion post last. Hindsight is so much easier than foresight.  At the beginning of the course, I would have said that the biggest problem was over development.  Having witnessed massive population growth in specific coastal areas that were in my own lifetime once labeled rural, I was certain that this was the issue.

<p>Oy! The <I>ignorance</i> I exhibited.  The issues are much more complex than simply excessive development.  People must live somewhere, why should they not be able to live at the coast?  The issue at hand is ignorance, not the development.  The same ignorance that I and many, many others exhibit in our interactions with our coast.  We are unable to grasp the long-term consequences of our actions, blinded by the beauty of the beach before us.

<p>Coastal study is a rather disrespected profession.  How many kids say they want to grow up and study the coastline?  Not too many.  Yes, there were those hay-days of aspiring marine biologists spurred by Free Willy and Flipper, but how many people gave up on that dream (I know, there are several of you in the class who fall in this category…thumbs up to you for following a green dream!).  The salary of any marine biologist or coastal expert cannot even come close to matching the petroleum engineer or hotel developer.  We seem to place a label, an image of the beach and anyone who works on at as lazy and merely enjoying the surf while throwing in a couple test tubes and checking what comes up.  You don’t become a marine biologists because you love fish, you do it because you love swimming.  Is that the most stupid and ignorant comment you have ever heard?  But it is the beach, why would you want to work there otherwise.

<p>This ignorant idea is that the beach is nothing but fun.  Why should you study it, just enjoy it.  We are the people who get mad at the guy complaining at the cinematic quality of Austin Powers III.  Why doesn’t he just enjoy it?   Our ignorant, short-sighted view that is unable to link the idea and thought nodes to the environment or ecosystem network is the greatest danger to the coastline.

===message:What I see as some of the major problems are human activities and greed. People start building in the coastal zone then start armoring the areas because the beachs start to dissapear. I think the general plublic needs to be more educated on the cause and effect of armoring. Another problem I see is the over population of coastal areas. This puts a real stress on the evacuation routes and utilities in the areas. And what about the natural habitat of the wildlife?  They need a place to live too.
