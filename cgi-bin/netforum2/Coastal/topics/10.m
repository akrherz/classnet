===subject:Discussion #7 Invasive Species
===message:This subject always, always leaves me scratching my bald head.  Is not foreign or invasive species displacement of native species simply evolution?  The first thought that ran through my mind was concerning Native American Indians.  I wonder if the white man is a foreign invasive specie in their eyes?  Smile.  In recent times, do Americans see the rapidly increasing population and influx of Latino cultures as displacing anything?  How about Asian cultures?  The mere word invasive is harsh, too harsh for me.  Would a natural migration of these species be considered invasive or simply nature taking its course.  Storms relocate species every season as does the movement anything between two eco-systems.  The zebra mussel has found at least one friend in the Great Lakes and that is the many species of diving waterfowl such as Scaup, Old Squaw, and Buffleheads, they are deep-diving ducks that feed on the mussels.  Maybe we need more ducks, please support your local DU Chapter for wetland preservation.  The zebra mussel is regular subject matter in Ducks Unlimited and other conservation magazines.  From the reports I see, it has few overall, if any, redeeming qualities other than a minor food supply for these birds on their migration.  The Green Crab I have no knowledge of but apparently it has few friends too.  I remember in the 1970's the Texas Parks and Wildlife warned freshwater boaters to clean their trailers thoroughly before going to a new lake.  The effort was to curtail the burgeoning spread of hydrilla which was believed to be choking off sunlight and would eventually starve out the bass fishery.  The White Amur carp was introduced, a foreign species, to control the quickly spreading beds of hydrilla.  The fish ate themselves silly.  The hydrilla beds prospered.  Now, twenty-five years later, fishing guides and recreational fishermen focus on the hydrilla beds as most of the standing timber in the aging lakes have simply disappeared from time.  Bass fishing is as good as its ever been and now they have a fishery for the White Amur as well.  This foreign fish was intentionally introduced.  The hydrilla is proliferating regardless of our attempts to stop it.  Migrating waterfowl cannot help but take advantage of hydrilla beds, at every opportunity they gorge themselves on it.  Many of their once natural coastal feeding areas no longer support freshwater marshes from the saltwater intrusion of the changing sea coast.  Rice production along the Gulf Coast has been drastically reduced since the 1950's.  Migratory birds continue to adapt to the changing environment.  The North American Ringneck duck winters predominantly in Florida, any Florida lake having hydrilla has thousands upon thousands of these birds in the winter.  Shoreline developments of bulkheads, fishing piers, and boat docks have eliminated much of the shoreline cover for nesting fish.  The hydrilla beds have replaced this as the breeding nursery of choice.  No one can argue the hydrilla beds are not a terrible boating nightmare, but there has been a direct and timely benefit to many of natures creatures at a time they needed the assistance most.  If we are to legislate policy controlling the shipping industry then we must be prepared to take the same responsibility for US outbound shipments.  In video #5 Professor Andrew Ferguson discusses the ballast issues of the maritime industry.  His suggestions that onboard treatments have yet to be effective may be true, but it is simply a matter of time till this is perfected.  Do we really want a government inspector meeting each inbound ship and sampling their holds?  Who can and should afford to pay this cost?  And the only people that continue to pay for everything is the taxpayer, whether it be directly through government programs or through higher priced consumer goods.  There was a comment made about the zebra mussel affecting the fishery in the Great Lakes.  I have several "Captain" friends who run charter boats there.  No one is telling me the salmon, lake trout, and steelheads are hurting.  Lake Erie in the past fifteen years has become a world-class walleye fishery.  The average size of the catch is shrinking but it can be directly attributed to increased pressure as there are more fisherman on the water than ever before.  These fishermen are better equipped with modern radar, sonar, boats capable of fishing in extreme weather, and radio equipment that enables them to communicate with each other about fish locations.  We should do what we reasonably can to retard the importation of species which will be invasive and have a negative affect on our environment, but we must also recognize the world continues to evolve.  Our human activities will always create change, some perceived as beneficial, some not.  Time will tell which ones are truly damaging or helpful to a particular eco-region.  Man ruined the Newfoundland cod fishery, but nature replaced it with an exploding shrimp, snow crab, and lobster fishery.  Are humans not an invasive species?   Capt. Dave

===subject:Policy Options
===message:I don’t know how much any regulation or policy can help to hinder the problem.  In the same vein that disease and pestilence do not know borders, nor do species abide by the arbitrary demarcations of nation-states.  That organisms migrate from one area to another is a fact.  I believe individuals are, first of all, cognizant that is through their behavior that “exotic” or “alien” species have taken over a new ecosystem, and, second, that the dominance was not necessarily what mother nature or evolution would have produced.  However, the little biological and physical sciences I know does not lead me to believe that regulation will or can stop the introduction of exotic or alien species into a new ecosystem as long as humans travel.  Viruses, bacteria, and microbes do not need ballast tanks to travel in; they only need the warm membranes of a nose.  However, there are a few specific policies I see that may hinder the introduction of exotic or alien species.  First, the importation of alien species must be monitored and in some cases prohibited.  For example, exotic pet stores must be strictly regulated.  Indeed, not all animals should be pets.  At this time, we already vigorously monitor and prohibit the importation and ownership of an array of big cats such as lions and tigers because of their apparent danger.  It is not out of bounds to add other species that we may perceive of as more benign but have greater harmful affects upon a whole ecosystem: for instance, fish, rodents, or birds.  The second issue may be one that is irresolvable.  That of the transportation of alien species through commerce.  Woodard gives the example of tankers that fill up their ballast tanks with water from one part of the world and release it when they arrive in another.  Similarly, with the globalization of production and distribution where any product such as a cotton shirt or automobile is constructed or assembled at numerous sites around the world the prospect of an alien species “tagging a ride” greatly increases.  I worry more and more about the globalization of food production.  Mad Cow and hoof and mouth disease is a case in point.  It happens to be an example where proactive and vigilant policy has, at this time, appeared to pay off, but for how much longer.  We will need to go much further if we hope to stop the introduction of alien species.  This means the application of costly inspections for all products imported and exported.  Inspections that must utilize every technology at our disposal.  Third, policy must begin to confront our lack of knowledge of how one species will affect an entire ecosystem.  As Capt. Dave alluded to in his posting, when is the arrival of a new species into an ecosystem a natural development of evolution or the unintended harmful effects of human behavior?  It is question that can only be answered by science.  However, policy makers are reluctant to use valuable resources for an answer that they may not like.  Indeed, as Woodard states in chapter 4, policy makers only look for win-win situations where “environmental protection and increased profits coincide.”  Therefore, a policy that uses large amounts of tax payer dollars to fund from the out set what is not a very popular policy that very likely will name a whole host of a politicians industrial supporters as the cause and, consequently, cause severe economic costs for his/her constituency is likely not to be proposed let only adopted.  Essentially, the political will may not exist to find the root cause(s).  As I see it, policy and regulation must address the lack of knowledge of our environment, then manage the problems that exist, and where possible intervene in a proactive manner to stop the introduction of alien or exotic species.

===subject:What we should do 
===message:When a exotic organism enters a system that they are not originally from, could really hamper the biosystem to the current animals that live there.  There would be competition for food and living spaces, thus leaving the orginal life forms struggling to survive.  From a policy point of view what we should do about it is simple.  From a coastal point of view the government should make regulatiions and have inspectors inspect all cargo or people that come to the coast of the United States or any other country.  Something like what they do at the border patrol today they should do the same thing at the coast.  First by inspecting everything that comes to the coast. Second if they do find something they confiscate the plant or animal and bring it back to it's original habitat.  It may cost more on the federal budget, but it won't affect the habitat of the original life on the coast and the water.

===message: Well man has done it again.  We've taken a perfectly designed system and changed it to meet our needs.  Like most modifications we humans do, to nature, it was not intentional.  However, this dosen't change the fact a very fragile ecosystem has been disrupted, and not in one place but as Professor Rodgerson said in the video "several countries have had their shore ecology altered due to ship ballast."  In cases like the Great Lakes and San Francisco Bay one wonders if the "natural" ecosystem will ever return.  Some would call this transfer of species from one area to another "evolution."  I would call it man's unintended effort to change the earth's fragile environment. If we look at the issue of invasive species strictly from a regulatory viewpoint than regulations must be in place to control the problem of water transfer from one country to another by ships.  As professor Rodgerson stated "controlling this problem will be difficult."   However, he goes on to say "companies have come out of the woodwork to create a solution."  Knowing the economic impact this issue has had should help to solve the problem.  Unfortunately, many times it takes a monetary goal to encourage the underatanding of a problem and bring it to its ultimate conclusion. As for the public perception of the problem, I doubt many know, or care, about "ship ballast or dirty sand."  I certainly wasn't aware of this situation until I enroled in this course.  It's going to take more people like Profesor Rodgerson and courses like this to enlighten the public on the drastic consequences of the problem.  Maybe then the public will force a "government of the people" to inact the necessary changes needed to solve this enigma and stop any further damage to the environment and hopefully find a way to "fix" what's allready been done.

===message:As Dr. Rogerson talked about in the guest interview on the "Dr. Politics" show, the problem of invasive species is real and growing. I was never aware of the problem that ships posed by bringing in coastal water to balance themselves, and in turn that transfered water carried disruptive organisms. I think Dr. Rogerson presented some great ideas, such as brining in non-coastal water to ships, but as he explained, it looks as if Congress will have to pass mandatory laws to combat the problem because as explained in the lecture, the alternative methods have had disappointing results. What was even more interesting was the talk of indicator organisms ending up in the sands, or beach contamination.  I think I would spend a lot of money in that area and give the researchers a chance to see how serious this problem really is, because if these species are living and expanding on our beaches, we have a major problem on our hands. I would also propose more media coverage towards the issue. This stuff seems to slip by the publics eye all the time; if we can generate some media exposure, then more and more people would become aware and more excitement and energy will surround these projects. It makes more sense to cover this than the Robert Blake murder trial; but that is just my opinion.

===subject:How to regulate 
===message:There should be many things that we do to regulate the problem of “exotic species”. All of over the world, countries are having a difficult time with foreign species.  One examples that we already know is the comb jelly in the Black Sea, but there are also many in the United States. The Great Lakes and the Mississippi river have a huge problem with the zebra mussel.  This species arrived from Europe on a vessel to the Great Lakes and with humans as its transporters (when boats are taken from lakes and then put into rivers) the organism infested the surrounding rivers.  I know that one thing that we are doing now is a reminding individuals about this mussel.  The DNR has many posters hung up around boat ramps to remind boaters that this mussel is controlling the habitats and is not allowing the natural species to flourish. <p> I think education is the most important way to regulate the “invasive species” problem.  The DNR posters are a good start, but citizens need to know what’s out there and what organisms hurt our surrounding ecosystems.  Nutrient pollution has its dangerous consequences, for example algae blooms.  I think that we need to regulate how much we want the coastal waters to be over nourished.  When algae grows like mad it allows other organisms to have a huge feast by eating them.  This is very scary since you don’t know what “exotic” organisms are out there that could respond to this.  Pollution and other promoters of rapid growth need to be regulated.  Education and regulation of pollution might be the way to handle this problem.

===subject:Alien species
===message:This is a real problem to control or regulate. Many of these species are unintentionally introduced by ocean-going vessels to and from foreign trade countries.<p>

Even though for the most part these species are introduced by accident, they can cause, in some extreme cases, severe unbalance in a local ecosystem whenever an "alien" enters the system, where there isn't a natural predator for it. These alien species can then take over a region until it has exhausted all the natural resources that were in balance in that area.<p>

I am not sure, honestly, how to best regulate this problem. We could try some sort of costly "scanning" system that would check vessels arriving from foreign regions for alien species in their ballast tanks or attached to their hulls. This seems impossible, given the number of ships leaving and entering ports, and the human resources it would take, of scientists familiar with local species, and checking for new introductions.<p>

It seems as though once an alien species establishes a foothold, it's almost too late to do anything about removing them, at least in a cost-effect manner. This is truly a tough problem to deal with.<p>

One thing we can try to do, anyways, is to educate the public against intentionally introducing "exotic" species to an area, by alerting them to the dangers involved in unbalancing a local ecosystem.

===subject:Evolving
===message:I will agree with Dave Hutchison and Marshall Arnett, this is evolution at work, although not as it might have happened without us. What to do about it is a people problem. The ecosystems will adjust and the more fit species will fill the niche, others will move or become extinct (at least locally). This is how things work. <p>

If the change in species causes a problem for people then we need to solve the problem that actually exists. If zebra mussels are fowling pipe intakes we need to figure out how to keep intakes clear. If species of economic importance to humans are threatened (after we are sure they really are) then we would need to take steps to control populations. This will take research into the entire food web of the habitat before an effective program could be designed. <p>

Trying to stop this type of migration would be greater than most economies could bear. Reasonable precautions, taken to slow the spread (as we do in California with spraying, rules about moving local fruit and the release of sterile medflies) are probably the best we can do. If an "exotic" really causes economic harm, the political will can be found to search for a specific solution

===message:This one is quite tough.  The only thing I know for sure is that all purposeful introductions of invasive species must be more strictly regulated.  While not addressed as heavily in our readings, there have been many ecological disasters caused by this foolish “quick fix.”  When I visited the Everglades a year ago, the tour guide showed us a tree (the name escapes me – I think it was mella luca) that was native to rainforests but had been planted in the middle of the swamp in the hopes it would dry up the land to make it easier to develop.  Now every effort to kill the tree fail and it drains precious swampland.  In Australia, the Cane toad was introduced in a brilliant attempt to kill greyback cane beetles that were hurting sugar cane crops… several feet higher than any toad could reach.  The poisonous beasts have now run native beneficial organisms out of their habitat.  
<br>
You can’t call this evolution.  Evolution respects diversity.  Without diversity, a major catastrophe could wipe out all life.  Natural evolution works on the principle that diversity allows the whole ecological system to prosper in the face of adversity.  Just like it is true that species naturally go extinct, they also migrate and invade other territory when necessary, but we must recognize that is in our best interest (for all kinds of reasons from monetary to sustenance to maintain stable ecologies and make very careful, managed decisions when affecting nature’s balance.
<br>
With that said, I don’t see how it is possible to achieve in totality.  This problem is huge.  I’ve even discussed it in a overview class of American Foreign Policy at Iowa State.  Even if we set up regulations demanding ships to dump ballast water off ocean, some ships never reach open water.  If we set up expensive screening systems, the people who would suffer much are those already struggling to buy food when the added cost is passed on to the consumer.  To top it all off, the problem doesn’t just come in ballast water.  Organisms can hide away in the cargo itself (eg. Insects in timber, etc).  In a global economy, this issue is almost too large to fathom.  In my humble opinion, I think the easiest way to help the problem would be stringent monitoring of all imports (including ballast water) to attempt to detect those organisms that will be the problems.  This seems more feasible than ceasing all transport of organisms.  Still, this solution would only be applicable to nations like the US with the infrastructure to monitor.  Maybe the UN could take on a role in monitoring dire situations in poorer countries.  Also, I think research into technology that ships can use to properly buoy themselves with something besides local water may prove successful.

An example of this would be how the DNR puts up all of those signs around boat ramps that tell boaters to make sure and clean their tralier/boat of algae and look for any other lake stuff that could have gotten onto their haul.

===message: It seems to me that the problem of invasive species has no solution, or at least not a final one. The organisms might be so small, and in such large numbers, that totally extracting them from the water, or wood, would be nearly impossible. The possibility of ships loading, and dumping their ballast's water at open sea locations might help to curb the problem. Of course as Dr. Rogerson commented, this is not a final solution, first because many ships never get that far from the coast i.e. Cruise ships. Second, those ships that do go far out into the Ocean find it difficult to navigate at those locations, since the empty hulls tend to increase the instability of the ship.
<p> Perhaps the most that can be done by local, and national governments is for them to refrain from using "foreign" species to the region, while fighting undesirable local organisms. Cleaning stations at the nation's ports sounds like a fantastic idea, but the costs paired to their use does not make them a choice for underdeveloped countries. In any array, the most significat threat to the environment, and coastal economies comes from other sources like watershed pollution and/or dissapearing, global warming, indiscriminatory species exploitation. I think that solutions to these problems should be given priority.

The Dr. Politics show touched on the Great Lakes region a little bit, that seems to hit pretty close to home being from Iowa.  Even more of a concern than new species is the viruses that can also be introduced.  I think it is natural for areas to adapt to new species, but even that process can be greatly disrupted if the entire natural environment is damaged by disease.  Why has there not been more attention given to this topic?, as it is a very serious subject.  I think priorities need to change a little bit in the policy making arena.  Focus needs to be reallocated a little bit away from individuals rights (ranging from single person to corporations) to make a profit and better lifestyle and given back to the very source that makes these individuals' lifestyles possible.  It may be an inconvenience for a large container ship to take 2 days to change water but isn't that worth it.  To me, which I have a tendancy to think very simply, it makes sense to reload the ship with more cargo rather than water in the first place (sharing ships between companies so that one ship can do the job of two, there and back full rather than passing each other full on the way to the other's original port and passing each other empty and full of water on the way back).  I think this is an area that needs to be more publicized that way people see that it affects them because until they see that not a lot will change.

===message:Controlling these "alien invasions" seems impossible. It seems to be very difficult and costly to attempt to eradicate foreign species from ballast water that travels the globe. A better solution might be (as someone else mentioned) to use these large cargo ships more effectively by ensuring that there is enough cargo available to make a full return trip, free from ballast water. It would be more cost effective and profitable for shipping companies to do this - they could even rent out cargo space to other companies if they don't have a full load. Another solution might be to develop or use some other material as ballast. Why cant they use giant blocks of metal or wood to create enough weight to lend stability to a ship? These could be reused over and over again, available to rentin different weights at various ports worldwide. Or perhaps some sort of synthetic liquid or other material could be developed for use as ballast. The Coast Guard undoubtedly employs some of the best researchers, engineers, and scientists in our country to put to work on this problem. The best thing policy makers and politicians could do would be to mandate that cargo ships use some other form of ballast. However, even this will not "solve" the problem of invasive species. Small organisms and other sea creatures will still hitch rides on passing ships to foriegn waters. <p>Ocean's End briefly discussed a few attempts by scientists to introduce alien species into an area to counterbalance ecological systems that are out of balance. I seem to recall a mention of a plan in the Black Sea to introduce a predator of the extensive jellyfish population there, although there is no way to predict the long term effects of such a move. This situation is a little more tricky. Perhaps it should be left to policymakers and scientists to do a cost/benefit analysis as to which is the more serious problem - leaving things as they are or further changing an already unstable environment with unknown effects. The intentional introduction of a foriegn species seems less of a problem to me because this situations have been calculated and analyzed by experts, to some extent, and are not simply unintentional unplanned invasions.

However,there is a big problem  with invasive and exotic species and there ability to upset the natural ecosystem. Species such as Zebra Muscle, Giant Crabs, and Giant Jelly Fish are a few examples that were mention that cause problems to the  natural life of the ocean and the disturbances of water intakes in power plants.

Although the coast gaurds were challenged to manage a voluntary exchange of water, I think Congress has to make this act mandatory to all ships. I believe if we can speed up the exchange process from 48 hours to say 4-6 hours then manadatory exchange would be suitable. The problem now is time and there are no suitable inventions to make this process as less time consuming as possible.

Regardless of time we must have an exchange of water in ships ballast to prevent the spread of invasive species into our natural water system. Making this act mandatory for all ships would reduce disease and other unwanted orginism from penetrating the natural ecosystem.

Therefore, a major concern from a regulatory standpoint should be with ballast water.<BR>  The video spoke of efforts to create a system where ballast water would be treated in some way to destroy the organisms living in it.  If such a system could be perfected, then policies would need to be in place so that all ships docking at foreign ports would be required to use this system or be denied access.  If a ship were to disregard the policy and release its ballast, the owner should be held responsible for any damage to the local ecosystem from organisms deemed exotic.

===subject:Aliens in the water
===message:To regulate the problem of exotic species we will have to make the shipping industry more aware of the problem and hold them more responsible for their ballast waters.  We have tried to do this without regulation but the industry has not found it to be important enough to take seriously.  In the past when an industry finds they can’t rise to the challenge of protecting an environment legislation must come in and force them to find a way to change.  In this case I believe we must force the shipping industry to take a look at their practice of transporting alien creatures around the globe and realize that they are partly to blame for some of the problems.  When this is accomplished there must also be some rules for the shipping industry or any person using water ballast to follow.  Using a filter system or providing clean water to start with could be solution.  The main goal would be an elimination of ballast filling and emptying close to shore where the organisms can grow and take over a region.  I believe this should be enforced globally by some form of international treaty because the oceans are a global resource and what is happening here is happening other places.

===subject:Bunnies, pheasants, and gingko are all alien species somewhere!
===message:I think with regard to exchanging ballast water, it may be technologically possible to do and maybe even possible to regulate in the US HOWEVER, we need to remember that these invasive species are not elephant-sized.  Some of these tenacious little dudes can hang on to virtually anything (remember, they take on the world after thriving in dark, yucky ballast water for who-knows-how-long.)  They could hitch onto a yacht, a jet ski, or one of those zippy druglord speed boats.  How would we address THAT problem?  Spray everything down with some caustic substance? Where would THAT water go? What would be the environmental effects of such a policy? Moreover, what about the microbiota that would be resistant to the cleansing process? Remember, the Lysol in your kitchen that kills 99.9% of the bacteria leaves one in a thousand that can withstand the assault.  If we "lysol-ed" boats on a global scale we could still be in for a global problem. We're talking vessels of all different kinds from all over the world, and lots of different marine ecosystems with species yet to be named.  My thought is doing some trials on introducing the alien's predator and see how that turns out. If they can't get the bunnies out of Australia, how can we get the barnacles out of the wrong part of the ocean?

===subject:Invasive Species
===message:I agree with another student that suggested hiring biologists to correct a problem when it occurs.  I don't believe there is much that can be done from a public policy standpoint to prevent the invasion of an alien species.  If marsians decided to land on earth tomorrow, there really isn't much from a public policy standpoint that we can do to prevent it.  We can make it illegal, and if we catch them, we can throw them in jail or whatever, but the damage may already be done.  We may already be colonized.  The same is true with the introduction of a jellyfish to non-native waters.  I just heard on NPR yesterday of an ancient Chinese fish that was discovered in a pond in Maryland that may have come over in a ship's ballast or may have been released by a restaurant owner, as the fish is a delicacy.  It can live outside water for up to three days and has the ability to crawl and would be extremely devasting to fisheries in the area if it were to breed.  They're hoping this is the only one to make...and they haven't caught it yet.  Funds should be used to train qualified people to be prepared for such situations, contingency plans drawn up, etc.  Granted, it should be illegal, and if the person that introduces such a species knowningly is caught, he/she should face serious consequences.  I'm surprised terrorists haven't done something similar as a method of "biological" warfare.

===subject:Environmental Agencies
===message:While legislation to further regulate ship ballast could help fight the battle against invasive species, the best results will come from the enforcement of such regulations.  Federal environmental and marine agencies will be the real reason any battles can be won.  Whether it be the DNR on our lakes and rivers or the Coast Guard on the Ocean Coasts, the legislation is pointless without enforcement from the patrolling bodies.  The transportation industry will fight vigorously against anything that will lengthen trips for ocean going vessels, but through education we can mold public opinion so that the public encourages such regulation.  If the public does not see a need for further restricition of foreign species then any regulations put in place by the legislation would again be futile.

===subject:What can we do?
===message:That 's a difficult question. After studying coastal policy issues I can easily say what the results of any policy should be and goals to aim for regarding environmental quality and preservation. How to get there is another matter. A lot of "invasive species" are uprooted and end up in a completely different port because of barges excreting water from their hull after they have dropped off their cargo. The ships could be redesigned so there was no need for them to take on sea water for stability once they deliver their cargo. Shipping routes and exchanges could becoordinated to keep a ship full for both directions of the journey. Species that have already been introduced into foreign environments should be approached with extreme care. Introducing a natural predator, that is also foreign, to the ecosystem can prove to be as equaly disasterous as the first species. Continually adding mero species to eradicate the original problem could become a solution that spins out of control. These ecosytems need to be heavily monitored in the event that natural predators are added to the environment.

===message:<p>A foreigner strolls into an open area and unleashes itself in a way that kills everything surrounding it.  Does this not parallel some recent events more than we’d ever like to admit?  As we have seen in both situations, any attempt at policy has been deemed futile.

<p>The enforcement of any policy restricting dumping ballast or trying to punish the shipping industry would be as impossible as pulling over every underage kid carrying a six pack of beer in their trunk.  You just cannot do it.

<p>Biological solutions to the problem as mentioned in the book often involve introducing another foreign creature or disease that will then destroy the problem.  But how can we be so confident that any such move would not only deepen our descent.

<p>Technology is the appropriate solution.  Predators and disease, human designed, will solve our problems.  Three technologies, the Internet, robotics and genetic engineering will provide us the solution.

<p>The Internet allows us to collect and share massive amounts of data.  Robots, swimming along in the water can detect foreign animals through water sampling and “eye-sight.”  This data can then be shared with all sorts of other aquatic bots swimming around.  Why can’t the same technology that recognizes criminals and terrorists as they walk through an airport be used to recognize fish and other species that certainly don’t belong.  The only difference between airport detection and our device is swift justice.  The robot simply kills the creature.

<p>Genetic engineering, our other solution, involves the design of disease that can infect and destroy the offending visitor (and now, short term visitor).  We can do it with humans, why should not we be able to customize a disease for offending fish.

<p>How do we fund such technologies?  An interconnected network of costal robots would serve many purposes, possibly a telecommunications network and invaluable tool for researchers. Certainly both solutions generate a fair amount of complications and risks.  But are these risks greater than the devastation of our waterways?

<p>Of course, the simplest solution is to require more stringent regulation of freighters and their design.  While the United States has the money and power to enforce such regulation, many countries do not and probably would not if they perceive the risk to be low.

===message:I honestly don't know what can be done about species that have entered an alien environment.  In areas where alien species is destroying the current ecosystem, some people suggest importing their natural predator.  To me, that's just adding another unknown to the equation.  In my opinion, and after viewing video 5, the most logical way to deal with alien species is to stop them.  Make obligatory standards for the filling of ballasts on ships.  Prevent species from traveling half-way across the world.

===subject:down with the little critters....
===message:First of all I believe that the coast guards intentions of having the non-coastal water taken on were great, however it had to be obivous that it wouldn't occur voulnteerily.  Something does have to be done.  When these forgein creatures begin to move into the new waters which may be vulnerable (as the Black Sea was/is) it not only acts as a harvesting ground for that creature because of the lack of natural predators but also as yet another block for the return of that body of water to it's "natural" state.  I think a major area that does need to be monitored is in the Gulf.  In the book it spoke of how viruses from South America could easily travel to the Gulf Coast ports and spread from there creating an entirely new type of problems which could include health problems from citizens (i.e. West Nile virus).  From a policy point of view, something needs to be done to create a way for these ships to avoid taking on foreign water for the voyage back.  Another type of counter weight needs to be found, either as the coast guard suggested, off coast water, or someother liquid, gas, or solid that can be pumped into the ships at the ports which would be neutral at every port and could be released at with out harming natural habitat.  Or perhaps ports could have specific emptying tanks that the ships would hook up to that the exotic water would empty into and it would then be filltered and either disposed of (somehow)or used for another ships counterweight.  Either way, with current trends of jellyfish, green crabs, and zebra musscles in their new unwelcome territories we hope these will not be continuing trends in other areas as well.

===message:In the summer I live in Maine.  Let me tell you, the most invasive species here is a type of snail called the perriwinkle.  These snails cover all the rocks below high tide and continue further into the ocean.  They are everywhere and you can't help stepping on them ALL THE TIME.  The story goes that British merchant ships would have the perriwinkles attached to the bottom of the boat and also in the bilge water.  Like Prof Robertson said, ships empty the bilge and refill it before heading back to England.  In the process, the snails abandoned ship and began a new life in the New World.  Unfortunately, they have now overrun parts of New England, especially in the north.  What can we do about it now that they are here?  <p>
I am sure that this species has adapted well to its American environment and destroying all of them (how I don't know) would also destroy some of the marine species of plants and animals.  Then again, maybe life would be fine without them.  <p>
From a regulatory perspective, emtying bilge on land and uptaking new water OFFSHORE seems like a feasible idea.  One problem mentioned in video 5 was that this process would take over 48 hours and some ships either can't maintain stability offshore or don't even venture that far off the mainland.  Maybe the government could pump in offshore water and deliver it to the ships from land when they are ready to head back out.  THis is a tough question to answer.  Another solution mentioned by Prof Robertson was to expose the bilge water to UV light.  This could be more accessible but would it cause damage to anything else?  Experimentation is going to be the only way to find out what works and what doesn't.

===message:Because of global trade, more "invasive species" are being introduced to new regions.  Preventing the introduction of "invasive species" would be the cheapest and most effective way to stop the introduction of new species of animals, plants and other organisms.  Alien species are highly unpredictable and introductions into new habitats should be regulated and prevented by identifying the ways in which "invasive species" are introduced and develop industry guidelines for transporting products from port to port.  Also there should be studies of better ballast water management practices and ship designs to prevent unwanted cargo from boarding the ship.

===message:Although it sounds easier than it in fact would be.  Common sense would tell us to enforce rules and policies about dumping water in our domain.  Enforcing this policy would be a little more difficult.  You could get creative with this and establish ports of entry far out into the sea where it would be a "safer" place to dump their water.  Great care and knowledge would have to take place to track where this water came from and what exactly it could do to the water.  I found it interesting, sad, but not surprising that hardly any boats voluntarily dumped their water off site.

===message:The Invaision of the Asiatic Clams are a real problem in the Northeast. I am a commercial diver so I get to see the problems quite often. I have seen the effects of the clams at power plants on the Connecticut River and Merrimack River(N.H.) where they are growing in thier intake structures and fire protection systems.I have also seen the problems they cause in fire trucks. When waterfrom the river was used in one of the trucks, the clams started growing in the water tank and pump. The next time they used the truck all the nozzles were plugging up and it took quite a while to figure out what was happening. This could lead to a very dangerous situation. I have read about the Zebra mussels over taking rivers and lakes. That is a major problem, What to do about it?  In Conn. the department of environmental protection has posted notices at all public boat launchesto drain all water from boats, flush engine cooling systems and clean boat trailers when going from one area to another.These regulations are much like the regulations people in other discussions are talking about but on a much smaller scale. It is easy to clean a 20' boat and trailer. It would be a very large undertaking to clean the bilge of a large cargo ship.
