American Indians have certain "Sovereign Rights" granted to them by treaties with the American Government. Hunting endangered whales as a traditional ceremony and fishing for wild Salmon under conditions prohibited to the general public (prohibited to preserve the dwindling stock of Salmon) are two examples. <p> <b>
