===message:I believe that global warming is true and that it is one of the biggest environmental issues that we face today. Human activity is altering the planet’s climate and dramatic changes will affect everyone everywhere. The planet’s temperature is rising. I know that surface temperature measurements are recorded daily and they indicate that the 
Earth’s surface has warmed and has been particularly strong the last 20 years. This warming has been accompanied by a lot of evidence. <p>Direct manifestations of a widespread and long term trend toward warmer global temperatures have been studied intensely. I think that  these signs include: heat waves and periods of unusually warmer weather; sea level rise and coastal flooding; glaciers melting; arctic and Antarctic warming (well above the global average and this fits the climate predictor for the world with increasing levels of greenhouse gases) and melting permafrost which is forcing the reconstruction of roads and buildings. Even the migration time of birds is earlier and growing seasons are being lengthened.   This is enough evidence for me to support global warming. <p> I also believe that there are additional possible consequences to global warming. The potential consequence of climate change might affect agriculture and forestry (researchers already say it does). The impact of climate change on human health is also a huge debate. Will a warmer climate change the amount and distribution of mosquitoes, ticks..etc. and other things that carry infectious diseases? Or will worsening air quality lead to more asthma or lung disease? <p> Could global warming be good? This is a tricky question. I’ve read a lot on global warming because I used to be really skeptical about the whole idea. In my reading, I’ve learned that many times, the proponents of the theory of global warming frequently refer to carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Some people also say that carbon dioxide is the basic substrate that allows life to persist on Earth. These are the same people that say global warming is good because higher levels of carbon dioxide increase plant photosynthesis and water-use efficiency. If this is true, it would benefit agriculture. I think that this is true….but it would only benefit us temporarily. I, however, do not believe that there is anything good about global warming in the long run.

===message:Everyone at some stage in their life inevitably will look up from the grind of their day to day life and ask themselves, "What is really happening around me and what should my role in it be?"  With today's constant flow from the media concerning world events, we can and sadly do, choose much of the time to live in isolation from issues that we either fear, or believe, we cannot have an impact on.  The last chapter of Ocean's End suggests we think globally and function locally.  No truer words have been written.  Ultimately, it is up to us to determine our fate.  As of yet, there is no escape from our planet, therefore, we all must live here and share the consequences of everyone's actions.  Education is the missing link on many such subjects, global warming included.  I so not have any real or academic experience with facts surrounding global warming and can only approach this question from my limited media exposure and by trying to use reason.  It would seem reasonable to me that our atmosphere would trap the emissions from our activities.  I would speculate the conversion or degradation rate of pollutants in the atmosphere is insufficient for the quantity we are capable of submitting.  On this simple analysis alone, I would subscribe to the idea that global warming is taking place.  We may need the media to remind us of [world-wide] population growth, greenhouse gas effects on ozone depletion, and a runaway consumptive attitude of "all" humans and nations, but we do not them to be able to rationalize given time, this will be a major threat to our existence.  We worry more of nuclear destruction than ozone depletion.  Possibly, more so than nuclear war, this may very well be one of the catalysts which will create the major world conflict we so fear.  Once we realize resources, i.e., agriculture might suffer permanent damages and can no longer sustain/feed a continually growing world population; once aquaculture stocks have been depleted and nursery grounds destroyed eliminating another food source; and various areas of our planet might be uninhabitable for humans because skin damaging ultraviolet light from ozone depletion, it makes sense to me there will be a struggle for remaining territories that can sustain life.  Obviously, this is an extreme picture flirting with Hobbe's State of Nature, but one that is not necessarily far-fetched if scarcity forces our survival instincts to surface.  We already see the effects of poverty in less developed nations.  We know that general populations who receive education and manage to have a degree of wealth (food, shelter, clothing, safety, health) for its themselves when coupled with the basic human rights to be autonomous, elevates people to be more civiilized to each other and to act, or at least think, in responsible ways.  Continued atmospheric overloading from our irresponsible indulgence for consumption of "necessities" such as:  high electrical demand while the primary source of generation still stems from the burning of fossil fuels, coal and oil; the insistence to be highly self-mobilized (a more American tradition than other nations ) and have the freedom to drive our vehicles as often and as far as we want without regard to the emissions we produce; increased air traffic world-wide with similar subsequent emissions; and simply the more of us there are, the more housing we will require, which will bring us less exposed soil, trees, grass, functioning water ways and more concrete and shingles of space-age roofing that reflects heat instead of absorbing it.  If our lifestyle continues to emit gases or products that opens the atmosphere for increased penetration of harmful ultraviolet light, if our activities circumvents the earth's ability to absorb and dissipate these, and our actions produce a warmer than natural ambient air emission, we will suffer global warming.  There is no other logical conclusion and it is unreasonable to believe the earth's natural atmosphere can sustain and heal from everything we subject it to.  We know our planet and resources are and can be extremely resilient, we also know we do not have a grasp on the extent of the damange, or of the timetable severe consequences may present themselves, but global warming trends cannot be overlooked and disregarded in the "hope" it will get better on its own.  Environmental ducation should be a normal part of everyone's earliest general education, in an effort to increase and instill an awareness of what sustains us, so future generations have a chance at the quality of life we've so much enjoyed.

===message:One of the toughest prospects for me to consider in global warming is the fact that the data is so skewed it is impossible to know the impact. I know for sure that global warming is a problem, and it could be better or worse than the average predictions, but scientists are never 100% accurate. What I do know is that the scientists who do research this area need funding and media attention to further the projects... how do they get this??? They get it by making the problem seem worse than it really is. Take Dr. Pleasants Bio 123 course here at Iowa State (it is an online course). One of his lectures discusses the fact that no one really knows the entire effects of this process, and no one really ever will. What bugs me is that people seem to point their finger at a specific group of people, when they themselves enjoy the same that pleasures that are potentially causing the global warming effect. President Bush has recently acknowledged that global warming is here and is a potential danger, and I think that proves that it is becoming a very serious issue. Especially with the concern of the ice caps melting in Antartica, as discussed in the book. But look at the AIDS epidemic- people in the late 80's and early 90's harvested huge media exposure by "over-reacting" to the problem calling it a heterosexual disease. That got everyone's attention and now they have proven that 99% of the heterosexuals who contact AIDS are having sex with either homosexuals or drug users who share needles. My point is, these scientists never agree, and we the people who believe their information never really know the entire truth. I believe in global warming, I just don't know how serious it really is.

===subject:The evidence says?
===message:I’m inclined to believe that global warming exits for a whole host of reasons.  The first reason is the state of the study of CFC’s and ozone depleting substances.  Studies of CFC’s and other pollutants have consistently found that they have deleterious effects upon the environment.  Such studies are by no means authoritative.  They are inductive, probabilistic research where evidence is gathered and only after the accumulation of a significant amount can it be stated that something is likely to exist or not exist.  However, most of what I have read or seen, mainly from the mainstream news, states that the evidence gathered so far supports the claim that global warming is occurring from the release of CFC’s and other ozone depleting substances.  Even though the scientific research is far from conclusive, it is not the only thing that informs my decision.  As Woodard states in his book, it may not be possible to determine the decline of a habitat or ecosystem through the analysis or evaluation of one single factor.  Consequently, I look at the issue of global warming in a macro view.  
In addition to looking at the scientific evidence that analyzes specific or particular facts, I look at the issue in its totality.  That is, I focus on the big picture.  So in order to see global warming, I look at wide scale species depopulation/extinction, for example.  As Woodard chronicles in his book, species such as the sooty shearwater, kelp, urchins, abalone, fur seals, sea lions, diatoms and other algae, krill, and various types of penguins are all species that have experienced dramatic or catastrophic reductions in populations as global warming has been identified and progressed.  Indeed, it sometimes difficult to evaluate the causality of an effect if it is divorced from other information.  However, when we know that numerous species are being affected in similar ways, we may be able to better pinpoint the cause through a form of triangulation.
Along with wide scale species extinction/depopulation, one can also look at habitats or ecosystems for the cause(s) of global warning.  Ecosystem degradation/destruction is occurring in Antarctica, the Marshall Islands, and all along the north pacific of the United States.  If one wishes to understand why, a good start would be to ask what they all have in common?  As they are all very complex phenomena, it is difficult to ascertain why, but I contend if one looks for a commonality among the three, a cause may be identified.  While the evidence gathered so far is from conclusive, it leads me to conclude that global warming is occurring.
Obviously, I think its bad.

Me, I don't know what to believe anymore.  I believe in global warming and that it is a problem but how big of one I do not know.  I do know that I loved the past mild winter but that could or could not have been a cause of global warming.  I learned in biology last semester that although many people believe that the temperatures are the warmest they've ever been, in fact the temperatures around the time of the dinosaurs and such were much warmer.  But that was followed by some disasterous catastrophy which wiped them out so I feel that many more regulations need to be stepped up because time will tell if we are having such harmful effects or not.

Until politicians start looking at this issue by putting a lot less spin on it, I think that most people will be up in the air as to what they truly believe. It's hard for someone who is a non-scientist to understand all of the facts that go along with this problem and as such, it's hard for people like me to rely on others to feed them information.

===subject:Global Warming Effects
===message:Global Warming issues are a large part of the environmental community mainly because it deals with global changes that change the climate. Global warming, which is the strengthening of the Greenhouse effect, is due to greater amounts of heat-trapping gases being released into our atmosphere. One of the gases which hold heat is Carbon Dioxide. On a good note, a study found that plant growth increases as the carbon dioxide rate increases, however the growth rate then lowers back to a constant rate, and the plants are no long effected by the CO2 increase. Overall, the greater the amount of gases in our atmosphere results in an increase of the global temperature. When this happens there are both good and bad effects. On the negative side, ice begins to melt near the poles which causes the global sea level to rise. Also with the increase in temperature is the increase in evaporation rates which causes the soil moisture level to lower in some regions. On the positive side, precipitation levels over land increase, however a larger amount of rain is released in a short amount of time which may induce floods. All in all the bad effects of Global Warming outweigh the good, and in turn Global Warming is a phenomenon that should be avoided by all means.

===message:I do believe in global warming and that some of its effects are beginning to be evident, though not enough to really concern most people, or to convince large businesses or many governments that they need to be serious about changing their ways to minimize its effects.  From a human-centered perspective global warming is definitely a bad thing.  As we discussed in my renewable resources class, gradual changes in global temperatures are normal, and plants and animals are able to adapt to them.  But the rate at which global temperatures have increased recently is much faster than they are able to adapt.  As temperatures increase, the ranges of plants and animals change, and they may not be able to move quickly enough into the new ranges where they will be able to thrive.  Humans can further divide themselves from the natural world in an effort to stay unaffected by a rise in temperatures, but plants and animals cannot.<P>
As the book said about the different kinds of penguins in Antarctica, some animals benefit from the changes produced by global warming, and others suffer.  I'm sure this will be true worldwide.  The earth is indifferent to what species thrive and fail, it is humans and the creatures who cannot adapt quickly enough who will pay the price.<p>
If a sea level rise is in order, I would anticipate large numbers of coastal peoples in poor nations dying as a result, while coastal peoples in wealthy nations are heroically rescued, and those of us far inland watch on tv, suddenly feeling smug about being in the minority who live in the midwest.  People will be relocated and cities rebuilt, both at taxpayers' expense and donations by sympathetic tv viewers.  People in wealthier nations will manage, quietly thinking to themselves (for it would be heartless to say out loud before a little time passes by) that at least the dead poor people will help with the overpopulation problems.

===message:I think global warming is natural and obviously has been going on for a very long time, glaciers didn't disappear by themselves.  Some sort of general warming pattern exists.  The problem I feel is that the natural adjustments to the warming are being disrupted by the actions of humans.  Animals and plants alike are able to adapt to new environments by altering their make-up or if they can't adapt they are replaced by other organisms that can, it has been going on for a very long time.  I will use the example from the text for this, the penguins.  Originally a bird that flew and adjusted over time to its new climate.  Humans by way of industry and other development and messing up the natural adjustment and gradual increase of global temperatures.  So what happens is instead of the penguin being able to adjust and develop new breeding practices or the krill being able to form a protective layer of sking against harmful UV rays (that by the way wouldn't probably be needed if not for ozone depletion caused by CFC's) they just die off because they don't have enough time to adjust.  Is global warming really happening, of course it has been for a long time and it isn't a bad thing I don't think, I know I wouldn't want to be living on a glacier, I kind of like warm, sunny beaches.  I think what is really happening should be called something different, or just given a different descriptive phrase.  To me human's unhealthy interaction in the global warming process is like that of the introduction of a microwave to a hotdog rather than a nice fire, the fire cooks it slowly and perfectly and you can tell when you have almost cooked it too long and can still save it, whereas the need to always make things quicker and better causes the hotdog to explode in only a few seconds past when the heating should have stopped in a microwave and then it is all ruined.

<p>
For instance when we look at the fact that huge glaciers have broken off and that there is a hole over the ozone big 10.5 million square miles or more, I would have to say that there is a problem.  However, as far as tourism goes perhaps it is not all that bad.  Don't get me wrong, I am saddened by the environmental destruction we as humans have contirbuted to but, when you think about local tourism to places like say Michigan, there is green in them there warmer temps.  There is the potential for local tourist dollars go up as temperatures in the United States stabilize and people begin to travel more in their own geographic region instead of flocking to places like Florida.  On top of that Michigan offers some beautiful waterfronts without the worry of hurricanes.

===message:Is the world getting hotter?  President Bush dosen't think so. Neither do most of his advisors, but several renowned scientists do think we are warming up.  Last year I did a paper for one of Dr. Schmidt's class, actually the entire class discused global warming, and to be quite honest after all the discussion and research the consenses on global warming is mixed.  One relatively unknown fact, at least I wasn't aware of it, was that sensors which were established a few years ago, on earth and in space, both had different findings.  The earth sensors said the earth is warming by about .5 to 1 degree over 50 years, depending on where you live, while the satelites said the earth is cooling 1 to 2 degrees over the next century.  Which one is a fellow to believe?  Make no mistake which ever finding you believe certain regions of the world have had their environment changed forever.  Parts of Africa have had a devasting drought for over ten years.  While floods have ran rampant in South America and Europe.  Is this due to global warming or just natural occurences?  As the old saying goes "you can't fool mother nature" and to a great extent that is exactly what we, humans male/female, have been trying to do for centuries.  You can cut down only so much of the rain forest before the trees left can't produce enough oxygen or extract the pollutents from the air.  You can only kill so many of the fish in the oceans until this ecoysystem is disturbed.  You can only put so many CFC'S in the air until the ozone is damaged.  You can only pollute the drinking water so much, how about those cows, until new sources must be found, and what happens when we run out of new sources?  To top it all off and make a case for the earth getting warmer two major icebergs, in the last six years, have began to collapse shocking even the most agnostic believers of global warming. Nevertheless, governments say there is no need to put stringent rules on industry to curb pollution.  According to "top" government officials putting new and stringent anti-pollution regulations into effect would lead to devasting consequences for industry and the economy.  So like most things governments do best they want to continue to study the situation.  Form a panel to discuss the findings and "someday" make recommendations to another panel for more studies.  Possibly by the time "all" the studies have been completed humans will have completely destroyed the earth we live on, and like another saying I know "you reap what you sew."  Time will tell.

===message:Last summer I spent a month at Princeton working on a global climate model with Richard Wetherall (even he jokes about his name). Not being a real meteorologist I worked on how the model could be simulated for students to work with and what results could be developed. In the process I read several dozen papers on the subject. It seems that most of the research weather people are convinced that the climate is changing. I am a geologist and the climate has changed periodically throughout time. The difficulty occurs when you attempt to ascribe a cause to this change when we aren't sure what has caused other changes in the past<p>

According to what I studied, the giveaway (that humans are a significant factor)is the rate of change. The rate began very slowly at the begining of this century and has in the last few decades begun to rise exponentially. The problem this creates is that organisms cannot adapt at this rate. Most plants and animals can change their range only slightly with each generation. <p>

Temperature records in England which go back several hundred years do show a statistically significant rise in the last century. Mostly in night temperature - they are not as low. On Mauna Kea, Hawaii there is a carbon dioxide measuring station (relatively free from pollution sources) which has measured the increase in atmospheric Carbon dioxide. My students kept track of the loss of ice masses in Anarctica this season - to date 6004 square MILES of ice have been shed. Ken Nagy (Biology - UCLA) has observed that those penguins that breed and nest on the sea ice are losing population rapidly with the loss of their habitat. Both polar regions are deserts - there is very little precipitation each year. This amount of ice won't be replaced any time soon.
<p>

These are some facts but the really important thing, in my opinion, is that it doesn't matter who or what is causing the change. The real problem is what are we going to do about it. The model I worked with sees very little change in the tropics, about 9 degrees farenheit in the temperate zone about 15 in the polar zones. The mid-western United States will be drier - and so will southern California. If we moved the wheat and corn belts north into Canada there would be more land but the soil was scraped by the last ice age and it is not as deep and rich as the Mid-American states. Also some plants (either the C=3 or C-4 - I forget which but the grasses) do not do as well in productivity when the carbon dioxide level gets too high. This is from a few begining studies but needs much more research.<p>

We can mitigate the problem by actions, we ignore it to our peril. In the Cretaceous we had a really warm spell about 100 million years ago (definately not human fault). The warming of the ocean increases the volume. The oceans covered Iowa State - and surrounding territories. They went from the current Gulf of Mexico to the Dakotas and from the Rockies to the Appalacians, in geologic time of course. I would rather we work at ways to reduce all greenhouse gas contributions, monitor changes and plan for any possible future than stand around trying to cast blame or "prove" beyond any possible doubt. By the time it is proven it will be too late, the system has too much inertia.

===message: The temperatures are rising, that much we all agree. The touchy part of this discussion is how much higher are the temperatures, for how long has the trend existed, and for how long will it persist. Finally, is it all because of human pollution, or is it a natural evolutionary trend?
<p>The fact is that most data only accounts for the last 150 years, more or less; listening to public radio while cruising through Washington D.C, a group of scientists invited to the radio show agreed that this lapsus of time represents much less than one half of one percent of the time that has passed since human beings have being on earth. It's certainly true that it has been scientifically proven that certain chemicals, when reacting with the gases of the atmosphere, have the capacity of destroying some of the components of the atmosphere that protect the planet from overheating, but this is not the only reason. Earth's temperatures have been rising for the last 4000 years, since the last Ice Age, there is no proof that what we are seeing today is not a direct product of such evolutionary trend. It's been hotter than this before, and in my opinion we should realize that we live in a dinamic natural setting, which sometimes means that the changes are going to be in our detriment.  
<p>I think that the phasing out of some of those harmful chemicals it's a positive step in the direction of not accruing to the problem, but ultimately is not going to solve it.According to Woodward's findings it's obvious that Scientists have no clue of the real reasons for the climatic changes that we are witnessing nowadays. It's easy to point scared fingers and come up with stories without actually having to prove anything. Most environmental groups have developed a sort of a myth in which almost any kind of industry plays the role of a Boogie-man, which is in turned under a fierce attack from the scared masses that are just too worried to stop and ask for valid reasons to condemn them(industry).

===subject:Ruff's Wager: a non-scientist's decision
===message:<p>Attention: This is the ravings of economics student.

<p>I would classify my self as a cautious believer in global warming.  It is certain that the temperatures today are warmer than those of the past.  But the past, or more particularly the measurable past, is a tiny sample of only 200 out of billions of years relevant to the issue.  This casts quite a bit of doubt and as I am often wary of the arrogance of brilliant minds.  Regardless, I must admit I know only the basics on global warming.  Beyond class reading and what media has dumped upon me (largely a result of a Democrat pushed criticism of Bush’s environmental policy in order to gain a foothold to reclaim Gore as the rightful president of the U.S.), my knowledge on the subject is limited.  Of course, it is not a decided issue among scientists.  It often reminds me of the bitter debate among doctors of the cause of stomach ulcers--stress and acidity vs. helicobacter pylori bacterium, the latter ultimately the winner.  What follows is my basis for belief.  Admittedly, it is somewhat of a cowardly and overly logic based approach.  But I feel that it works and that unless we can definitely disprove any theories of global warming, it is the correct approach. 

<p>The basis for my belief in global warming stems from a <a href="http://directory.google.com/Top/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics/Game_Theory/?tc=1">simple game theory model</a> I thought about one day while sipping on a latte.  It is in direct parallel to <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/">Pascal’s Wager</a> in which mathematician Blaise Pascal defends his need to believe in God.  Out of the heavens and unto this Earth, I apply his logic to my belief in global warming.

<p>The game is set as follows:  We have two possibilities, global warming either does or does not exist.  These possibilities parallel Pascal in that the existence of God was an unknown truth that is largely a discrete solution. Global warming is an unknown that with a discrete solution, a yes or no.  We also have two possible actions, to act in a way to prevent or reduce the effects of global warming or do not act this way.  The matrix for such a game goes as follows:

<p>
<pre>		 Global Warming True	Global Warming False
Act		 5			0
Don’t Act	-5			0
</pre>


<p>The dominant strategy, a strategy in which one will always choose above other strategies, for an individual is to act in a way to prevent or reduce the effects of global warming.  One is always at least as well off by acting against global warming and possibly better off.  If we assign any level of possibility, P where 0 <P < 1.00 to the truth of global warming, the expected payoff of acting will always be higher than not acting.  The expected payoff can be calculated for either choice by taking the payoff value of a choice times the probability of that payoff occurring.  The overall expected payoff for a choice can be found by adding the two separate payoffs for that choice together.  For example, if there is a .01 chance that global warming is true and a .99 chance that it is false, the expected payoffs for each choice are as follows:

<p>Act: .01(5) + .99(0) = .05
<br>Don’t  Act: .01(-5) +.99(0) = -.05

<p>No matter what, one should always choose to act in a way that is preventive of global warming.

<p>One criticism of this idea may be the assigned payoffs.  Is it not true that the costs associated with believing in global warming and it being found false would lead to a negative payoff.  This is a possibility but it relies on extremes: 1) the probability of global warming not existing far exceeds that of it existing and 2) the loss from such futile actions is far greater than a choice of no action and the truth of global warming (essentially the cost of mass extinction).  For example, if we change the matrix to:

<p><pre>
		 Global Warming True	Global Warming False
Act		 5			-2
Don’t Act	-5			0
</pre>

<p>In this case, we are better off not acting if and only if the probability of global warming existing is small.  But if we take something like a 20/80 ratio, we see the following payoffs:

<p>Act: (5)(.2) + (-2)(.8) = -.6
<br>Don’t act: (-5)(.2) + (0)(.8) = -1 

<p>Both are negative, meaning no matter what we will likely be unhappy, but we are still better off acting to prevent global warming.  This, you will remember, is with a gracious advantage towards the probability of a false theory of global warming.

<p>Whether such a negative payoff truly exists and to what level each payoff can be measured is up to personal interpretation.  Global warming with no action could be good if you prefer to live in tropical climates, desert environment, or have a general distaste for animal species.  The false belief in global warming and action against it may result in generating an economy consisting of not only a prosperous industry of companies that design and develop applications that reduce the polluting outputs of today’s factories but to technological discoveries of more efficient and productive methods of production.

<p>So this ends the rant of an economics student who has not slept enough lately.

===message:I think that global warming to a very realistic issue and event.  I know that there has been a lot of conspiracy about  the temperature of the earth and that we don’t know for sure if its natural for this planet to heat up.  I feel that just because we don’t have very much data on the history of the earth doesn’t mean the global warming is not occurring.  <p> The reason why I feel that global warming is true is because there has to be a consequence for all the carbon dioxide that we put in our atmosphere.  Especially in the U.S. all of us contribute a tremendous amount of pollution to the air.  I think I would be more worried if the earth did not warm up due to this irritation!  I feel that global warming is bad, it will make the sea levels rise, causes immense UV radiation (which is not good for humans, also) due to the ozone layer being depleted, and it changes the “natural” state of our environment.  <p> This may seem quite odd, but there is a very good thing about global warming.  This issue is finally showing individuals how dangerous it is to destroy Mother Earth.  Everyone is talking about global warming and it is one issue that is grabbing peoples attention.  It’s about time!  We all are responsible for our actions and I think this issue is finally making people more environmentally conscious.

===message:I personnally think that it is hard to deny that global warming has already taken a significant toll on our ocean's life cycles.  With the well documented rise in global temperature and record warm weather in the Antartic region, the warmer temperatures may soon break a sensitive threshold that could harm many small and large species living in our marine environment.  But i also believe that large governments like ours will continue to fight any restrictions on ghg emissions arguing that there is no scientific evidence to correlate the rise in ghg's to the warming.  Developed countries will continue to cite economic reasons and lack of developing countries (china, india) participation as reasons not to take any real actions towards curbing warming.

===message:This topic came up in our University Studies 430 course with Dr. Schmidt (and, yes, apparently I was paying attention) and there was a day dedicated to the topic of global warming.<br><br>

There are many factors to be taken into account... the first being that we are pumping our atmosphere with toxic gasses that are trapping heat within our living sphere.  This same insulation, though, also serves to block out some solar radiation (and therefore, heat) so this cannot be the only reason.<br><br>

One area of global warming that greatly gets overlooked is solar output.  Over the last century, the star we orbit known as out Sun has increased its output.  Looking at a chart that compares this increase in output to the temperature patterns over the last century show that these graphs have nearly equal slopes.<br><br>

Is it possible that global warming is a natrual event?  Although we may add these 'greenhouse gasses' to our environment, as little as a 2% increase in output by our Sun would have the same effect as increasing the CO2 in our atmosphere by 150 times its current value.<br><br>

Keep an open mind when thinking about global warming, and remember to 'Think outside the Box'

===message:Even though global warming has been going on for a long time,there is enough evidence to suggest that it has been increasing since the beginning of last century.  This is due to industralization which produces CFC to the atmosphere.  This CFCs causes the depletion of the ozone layer when it oxidises to form oxygen gas which does not protect the earth surface against UV-B.
Colin Woodward points to the collapse of the Antarctic Peninsula's glaciers and ice sheets as an example of global warming.  
In Africa, swampy areas have dried up offer time due to increased evaporation due to increase sun intensity.
This is not good because it reduces cultivable land which means reduced natural food production.  In case of places like Antarctica, increased UV-B kills algae among other micro organisms. This means less food for the krill which feeds on algae and as such the all ecosystem is altered.

===message:Well, one thing is obvious and that is that temperatures are increasing.  So we ask, is it because of us? Our data and research covers roughly a century and half.  Compare to the amount of time this world has been around, that's a very small percentage.  Could this be normal, or perhaps a trend?  Or is the increasing temperature due to human carelessness?  My opinion is we're asking the wrong questions.  We know the temperature is increasing, but the fact that we even have to ask if it's because of us should be some indication that there's a problem with the way we're running things. We should be asking how we can cut down on pollution and preserve the earth.  It's obvious by looking at the skies of industrial cities, and by looking at our lakes, rivers, and oceans, that we are having an impact on the earth.  Unfortunately, that is a negative impact.  We need to be concerned with today and how our actions are affecting us now.  If we can start solving some of the problems we have now, then we'll stop problems from being problems in the future.  This is the only planet we've got and we need to start making better decisions.  It really doesn't matter if global warming is our fault or a natural cycle.  What does matter is that we've seen a problem with the way we're treating our earth and that's the problem we need to focus on now.

I think that global warming is definitely a true event.  It can be seen in the melting of the antarctic ice, and in the gradually rising temperatures around the globe.  I do not think that there are any positive things about global warming, at least not for humans.  I think that if the earth continues to warm and the seas continue to rise, perhaps marine life will begin to reclaim its natural glory and dominate the planet.  This would certainly seem to be the "Mother Nature" way of things.

===message:It is true that global warming is an issue, but as many others in this class have said, is this something that can be blamed on human carelessness?  And if it is, is it something that we can realistically change?  I just think to do enough to reduce CFC's and other factors that may increase warming, we will have a handful of other issues to bitch about and reduce.  I think if people were given a picture of what life would have to be like in order to satisfy those who offer alternatives that would reduce global warming, most of us would be unhappy with the new life they would have to live.<br><br>
As a society, we have become so developed and industrialized, something has to give and unfortunately that is the environment.  This class has exposed me to a handful of environmental issues I was previously unaware of.  However, I must play devil's advocate and wonder what life would be like if we had to put environment first and economy/technology/industry second to these concerns.  The oceans and air may be cleaner, but what would the price be of all this?  Reduced development and technology?  If this happened, would the U.S. start to slide in their position in the world's economy and as a superpower?  I am not sure, but I would think we would slide.<br><br>
Personally, I could live with making my life a little less easy, give a little more and take a little less, if enough people would follow so it would have an impact.  But too many people like things easy, comfortable, and effortless that I do not think people would change their ways for the better- people don't care enough about 10, 20, or 50 years down the line.  We live in the moment too much that I don't see things changing.  Soon the predictions of those who understand the earth and its ecology and environment will come to pass, and it will be too late to change anything.

===message:Global warming is a fact of life and I believe it has merit. We humans can't phantom the thought of living through the ice age billions of years ago and how the earth has changed temperatures since. On a small scale,if you are in a room with 15 people can you could feel the change in temperature as exposed to being in the room with one person.


As human beings multiply the rate of organisms will not be able to  keep up with this process. The earth is going through climate changes, just as it went through climate changes during the ice age. The questions is will human beings be able to adapt and prepare for such a warming. Will we be able to handle diffent carbon monoxide levels?
Will we be able to handle daily temperatures of 100 degrees (F).

It is a fact that there are some global warming and this has effected our ecological systems with the melting of icebergs and its effect on the oceans,winds, and hurricanes. The big questions is what are we going to do about it, and if so can we reserve enough funds to research this subject, so human life can co-exist with the climate change in the next few centuries.

===subject:of course it is true
===message:There are several gases in our atomosphere that are produced naturally, some of the most important gases are carbon dioxide and methane.  The gases are like the glass in a greenhouse, they let sunlight in to warm the earth but keep some of the heat from escaping back into space.  Luckily these gases have naturally existed for the past 10,000 years or since the last ice age.  But since we are now producing these gases much faster than the natural sinks which regularly remove them from the air can it is resulting in warming.  This all means that sea levels will rise-meaning storm surges will reach farther inland, and that will result in large amounts of property damage as well as flooding of cities such as new orleans, and will also result in interesting population density considering that there will be 400 per square mile.  There are many steps which we can take (as a planet...and that will be interesting to effectively organize and execute)which can reduce the excess of greenhouse gas emissions but we need to first be educated about our current status and about how each of our actions link to affecting other aspects within the environment.

===message:I think one of the most important things we need to remember in the discussion on global warming is that science and scientists' understanding of the cosmos is always, always changing. Good science only comes out of previous knowledge that was incomplete. Does this mean that we should not respond to global warming?  Absolutely not.  When some of the world's most prolific atmospheric physicists, climatologists, and ecologists are in agreement that this serious condition exists and part of its cause can be correlated to a steep increase in human industrial and chemical activity, then we should not only proceed with further research to more fully understand the phenomena surrounding global warming BUT we should also proceed, with the best knowlege we have at the time, with solutions to minimize our impact on global climate change.  Everything comes at a cost. Sometimes, cheap, available technology (i.e. internal combustion engine) produces unanticipated negative externalities.  Sometimes to avoid those externalities, we are forced to pay more, and maybe use another resource in excess.  We enjoy a pretty decadent lifestyle (even moreso when Iowa gets palm trees thanks to global warming :) but even the everyday things have a hidden cost.  While we can't escape the fact that the environment will be somehow compromised by human activity, when a known harm exists, especially one of this magnitude, we need to respond with creativity and resourcefulness.

===message:Global warming is definitely a significant problem facing the world today.  I fail to see any benefits from it.  Human beings are the major cause of it, and we therefore must find a solution.  Intense lobbying of Congress by power and automobile companies has kept us from ratfying the Kyoto agreement.  That doesn't change the fact that a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions is need just to STABILIZE current air concentrations at present levels.  A reduction such as this is not politically or economically feasible at present in the U.S.  We need to phase out coal and oil subsidies, reduce emissions, fully fund alternative energy programs, and increase subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable-energies technologies, among other things.  What politicians and corporations don't realize is that if they would be proactive and implement policies now, before things get really out of hand, they would massive amounts of money in the long run, create new jobs, and avoid the legal battles that will certainly be looming on the horizon if they do nothing.

===message:Global Warming is a fact.  We cannot ignore or put it off as science jargon.  It is effecting our lives, through changes at the polar ice caps and thus large changes in the makeup of the world's oceans.  I do not see Global Warming as an entirely bad thing.  Man has accelerated Global Warming and intesified it.  In terms of the world's history we have seen drastic changes in global temperature in short period of time.  Had man not damaged the ozone layer to the extent it has and had man not had the damaging effects it has had on the entire environment, global warming would still be occurring.  To an extent it is a natural phenomenon.  The Earth's temperature fluctuates over time, we can see that simply in the reccurrence of Ice Ages.  Humans are simply speeding up the cycle and that is not a good thing.  We continue to create bigger problems for ourselves by focusing on the short term.  Next up for us, Global Warming, hopefully we can learn from our mistakes in the past and have some positive effects for a change.

To a certain degree global warming is exacerbated by manmade pollutants but there seem to be weather trends that occur over hundreds of years and maybe we're just experiencing a mild increase in temperature that is completely natural. everyone needs to be aware of the results of global warming such as rising sea levels from melting glaciers. To small islands like Beliz, these issues are obviously more pressing than to an individual living in Iowa. It is important to realize that our actions are affecting conditions in the Antarctic and possibly casuing the hole in the ozone layer to mushroom.

However, I think it's fiction that the greenhouse effect is entirely responsible for global warming.  Throughout history, the earth has gone through phases.  At some point there were glaciers covering most of the world, so obviously at some point the temperature of the earth increased.  That increase was natural, part of the cyclical nature of the planet.  Why is it so hard for people to believe that another temperature increase could occur?  And before I get people hostile towards me, remember I already acknowledged that greenhouse gasses exist.

===message:The topic of global warming is a highly debated topic in today's political world.<p>

Although many scientists claim to have absolute proof that global warming is taking place, others would disagree. On the one hand, scientists point to the ozone hole size increases and the rising of the oceans on global coastlines. They use their knowledge of chemistry to claim that the CFCs we released into the atmosphere are causing the ozone hole problem by breaking the O3 bonds, etc.<p>

The other side of the debate is that we have only had the scientific ability to observe these global changes very recently in human history, and that we can't claim to know that we've caused directly or indirectly the global warming trends we see today. How can we be certain that these changes are a part of a larger picture, a process that the Earth does every once in awhile to keep things in balance, in a way that is unknown to us at the present time. It could almost be equated to the story of the 3 blind men who were feeling a different part of an elephant, and all 3 disagreeing as to what an elephant was really like, whether it was like a snake (trunk), a tree (leg), etc.<p>

In short, I think that it is hard to really be able to say, with absolute certainty, that we have caused global warming or that it is really as bad as "they" say it is. I will, however, concede that from the observations scientists have made that there very definitely does appear to be side effects of global warming all around us.<p>

But did we cause all of them, or are they a part of a bigger picture, a natural process the Earth goes through every "once in awhile"? Whenever you are dealing with a very large system, such as the Earth's climate and ecosystems, it can sometimes take years or centuries for results of actions to be noticed, and even then it's sometimes hard to say whether or not one or two things caused it, or a whole slew of small variables.

So, yes, I think global warming is quite possibly taking place, but I am not sure how much of it is 100% due to human cause.
