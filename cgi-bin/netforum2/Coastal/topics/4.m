===message:The American states and the federal government should keep allowing Native Americans to perform their traditions.  I feel that these natives should be given special rights.  They were here way before Europeans came over and they knew how to interact with the land in a way that would not be harmful.  The "Paddling Against the Tide" article explained that the Makah tribe in the North Pacific has been there for more then 2000 years and their whaling tradition has been with them through out this time until a whaling act stopped all hunting. I feel that the whaling program is important to their tradition and that we as U.S citizens should respect what these people have gone through (White people taking over their land, killing a large amount of them, being forced into reservations, and not allowing traditions to be carried out) and allow them to live their lives as they have been taught.  <p> I feel that the Makah people are responsible to the land and the oceans and that they know that too much whaling is harmful to their future rituals.  I think it is awful that since many non-natives over hunted the whales in the past that it prevented the Makah tribe to perform their ritual. I also feel that Native Americans know a lot more about protecting the land and living with the land then many other people in this country.  We should learn from them how important our forests and shores really are and that one whale being killed a year is not going to dramatically hurt the population of gray whales.   It’s also important to comment that the whale they kill most of the time will be entirely used, I mean the whale will not be wasted in any way.  <p> Native Americans have some special rights and I feel they deserve them and much more other rights than they will ever receive.  Even though killing animals may be seen as wrong in some eyes, humans and animals, as Dr. Schmidt commented in his video, are involved in this huge ecological process together, and we need to learn to interact and find the balance.  I feel that Native Americans, like the Makah know about this balance and that there rituals help to receive it.  As Americans I think that we should handle these special rights by allowing them to keep practicing their traditions.

===message:I used to travel to Milac lake in Minnessotta each year with my father to fish. The lake is an Indian reservation and the Indians have access to pretty much do what they want.  What they did was fish by "netting."  For one unfamilr with this type of fishing netting catches hundreds of fish each time the net is taken from the water.  This practice was against the law for all except the Indians. Over the years this type of fishing has caused the fish population of Milac Lake to dwindle to the point it is difficult for "regular" fisherman to catch fish. This has caused great concern among the white businessman in the area who depend on the lake for their business such as tour guides, fishing equipment, etc.  On the other hand the Indians sold their catch to restaurants as far away as Saint Paul.  Fresh Walleye is a prized dish on any menu. The lake, and surrounding areas, was given to the Indians in a "treaty" and as far as I am concerned they still own it.  However, maybe there could be a medium between what they catch and what they need.

===message:I'm not sure that U.S. states are at all equipped to deal with something like a treaty. Since many American Indian groups have basically a quasi-sovereign status, it is really the job of the federal government to work with them, nation-to-nation, and accomplish the goals of both the indigenous group (maintaining their culture, customs, traditional governance etc.) as well as U.S. policy, such as the Endangered Species Act. I know what was done in Kenya with their unique national treasures was to turn the management of several national reserves over to the groups that traditionally occupied the area. So for example, the Maasai are considered to be the keepers of the Mara (Serengeti) and in return they can raise their cattle and continue to perform traditional rituals (morans killing lions as part of passage to manhood.) It's cut down on poaching and brought in a source of revenue to groups that largely do not want to radically change their traditional societies.  Unfortunately, in the U.S. we have not adopted such a wide-scale innovative approach and are eviscerating the last shreds of traditional culture these groups have.  I'm pretty sure Iowa farmers kill more fish in one fell swoop of liquid manure than most Native Americans take in their traditional practices.  Now, if a species is seriously endangered and killing one whale is a real threat the the survival of the species, maybe some of the indigenous groups that rely on these animals for traditional practices could be brought into a conservation or respeciation program. We should view these groups as part of the solution, not part of the problem. And we should, to the furthest extent of our ability, honor agreements the U.S. has made with them and try to write a history of treaties that are not continually violated.

===message:If their practices are carried out in a responsible and humane manner, one that will not endanger the numbers of whales or salmon (and the article makes it sound as though this would be the case), then it should be allowed.  I think the impact of Native American tribes is minor enough that they should be allowed special rights hunting whales and fishing for wild salmon.  The numbers of Native Americans are small, they don't want to hunt/fish a significant number, and they ought to be able to preserve some of their rituals, which are older than this country.  Plus, the land that we call ours (the US) was theirs long before we were here, and they deserve rights to their way of life.  The whaling ritual helps connect the tribe to their spiritual connections with the earth, and I see no reason to take that away from them.

===message:Given healthy populations, there are limited reasons to interfere with the legitimate humane harvest of any species.  Those opposed would be better served to become involved politically and resolve differences through negotation and legislation.  It isn't so much as what was written on a treaty years ago, as it is respecting cultural customs and honoring an agreement.  If times have changed and the resource cannot sustain the intended harvest, then all parties involved or affected need to be educated on the issues and the matter solved intelligently.  I cannot believe the Native American people I personally know would intentionally overharvest any game animal.  If this were to actually occur though, it would likely be done through lack of knowledge, and this might be where our technological resources can benefit them and do more to further our relationships over their sovereignty and tribal rights.  I would support their right to maintain a harvest within sustainable populations of game or fish, pass along cultural harvest rituals as they deem appropriate, and enjoy their heritage to its fullest extent.  No harm done, no harm created, no harm intended.  Capt. Dave

Not only do we have a treaty to honor with these people, but what they are asking for is not too unreasonable so long as the whale population remains high enough to sustain their traditions.

Yes, a treaty is binding but sometimes treaties outlive their usefulness especially if they are 150 years old.  It is understandable that the Makah want to bring back their old tradition but isn't the reason they gave it up the same reason why people don't want them to begin killing again, wouldn't that be going against their own principles?  If the goal is to connect with their younger generations and teach them some values and respect then maybe they should begin by showing them they need to respect the whales and the rest of the world.  Once again, I am all for traditions and the old way, but sometimes change is good.

===message:I think that it is ridiculous that anyone legitimately protest or prevent the Makah tribe from performing this ancient tradition of killing a whale. One. One whale will not devastate anyone or anything. Perhaps if the tribe chose to kill many more whales than needed, were being wasteful or recklessly harming the environment, a legitimate case could be made against it. It is also important to note that the Makah tribe voluntarily ceased to practice this ancient tradition for 70 years due to excessive whale hunting and damage incurred by other groups. 
From a political standpoint, it is critical that the U.S. government uphold the treaty previously made with this and other indigenous tribes. In my opinion, the only legitimate reason to break a treaty is in the interest of self defense and national security. Whimsically altering and breaking treaties is poor practice and must be grounded in something of vital national importance. Perhaps even more important, the U.S. might appear weak and unreliable and lose power and credibility internationally if our government acts as though outdated treaties are of little significance and can be disregarded.

The Makah have shown that they honor the whale by not exercising their rights during the period of the whales very limited population. They have also agreed to modify their tradition in the interests of a humane kill. The decline in the populations of the Gray Whale was never a result of the hunting by Native Americans. Their continuing the hunt tradition will benefit their culture, the identity of their young people and add protein to their diet at no harm to the whale population. While I respect the identity many of us have with the various Cetaceans and their "language" and intelligence, it is also true in all populations that a predator is necessary to cull the weak and less able. A little hunting would probably improve the gray whale's chance of survival. They would learn to avoid humans.

===message:I have read many postings by individuals regarding the tribal traditions of whaling hunting. First, I feel it up to the United States to live up to their agreement with the Makah tribe. Tha Makah tribe has lived up their half of the agreement by living on a reservation, and by conforming their traditions to make the killing of the whale "humane". Second, I feel that it was not the Makah's solitary whale killing that put the whales on an endangered speices list in the first place. It was our own technology, industry, and want that killed the animal faster than it could regenerate itself. That was an error, of many, on our part that the Makah tribe should not be held responsible for. Even when the Grey Whale numbers were deminishing, the Makah tribe found it upon themselves to contribute and bring their numbers back up. Lastly, I feel that Native American tribes do have certain rights, obligations and traditions that they have acquired and mantined for many years, that should not be up to other Americans to strip from them.

The tribes have not put the whales on the endangered species list, if anything they have helped preserve the animal.

As Andy Ruff described in a reply earlier on the board, this tribe does not need to hunt the whale for its existence. We should not put a tradition or ritual's importance in front of the existence of a species who has the right to co-exist with humans. Say for example a lamb was endangered. We would not allow Christians to slaughter an endangered species to carry on their traditions. The Makah claim that hunting is a spiritual birthright, but there are other ways they can hunt- there is no need to hunt endangered species in today's day and age. Our society is far past this time. The federal government should not give these tribes special rights just because they feel bad about shoving these tribes around in the past, just as they should not give minorities who were treated poorly in the past special rights to make up for the past wrongs. Equal treatment under the law for everyone, plus it keeps the environmentalists happy in this case.

===message:There were many, many treaties signed by both the US government and various Native American tribes during times of great population spread throughout the Western US. Many of these treaties gave rights and lands to the Indians that were later taken away, forfeighting their rights.<p>

We have generally done much damage to most of the lands and seas we took away. To the Native Americans, however, this land was sacred, and they treated Nature with respect, and understood much about preserving and not overusing their lands.<p>

I think we have done far more damage to our coastlines than a whale hunt, by a tribe that holds such a tradition as sacred and holy, and won't abuse the earth's resources much like we have. These whale hunting rights are a part of some of the few treaties the US honors to this day. They had those "rights" when they were here alone, before we came along and herded them onto reservations. I don't think, since this is part of a culture identity, and something sacred to them, that we have to worry about the Native Americans abusing or overusing their whale hunting rights for commerical uses or other uses outside of tribal traditions.<p>

I feel they should be allowed to carry on their whale hunting, salmon fishing, and other rights. They even demonstrated their concern for Nature, when, of their own accord they stopped whale hunting over 70 years ago when they realized that the population was dwindling, even though it wasn't by their doings but ours. That shows, to me at least, that they care about what happens to the whale population, and will continue to respect them.

===message:First of all, I would have liked to hear more about the opinion that this might open further loopholes in the International Whaling Commission.  We must consider this as an international issue as well.  Second, the argument over the treaty seems a moot point because probably every Native American tribe signed an equally useless treaty with the United States, and I don't think we're going to agree to give them all of the land and other resources back that is rightfully theirs.  But, if the loopholes were an unconvincing argument, I'd still have trouble taking away (or not granting) the right of the Makah to hunt.  

I would, however, suggest the government condemn and/or discourage the actions because truly I do not think they follow in what I have learned as a far more beautiful tradition of the Native Americans to treat the land with respect and never take more than you need.  The truth is, the hunt isn't necessary.  They do not need the food or other resources gained from the whale.  Whether it is one whale a year or whatever the agreement is, it isn't necessary.  Tradition shouldn't grant people rights to do wrong.  While I'd be hard pressed to find a policy-based reason to forbid the hunt, a thousand reasons exist to try to encourage its cessation, more research into the whale populations, and the possibility of international ramifications.  Maybe the tribe should be charged a fee equal to the amount it will cost to research the whale population to make sure the hunt is still allowable.  Maybe they should be offered an incentive to take another option.  It sounds like the elders are quite set on the idea of the hunt, but I don't think it will accomplish their lofty goals of re-identification with the tribe.  It could very well scare away tribe members with strong beliefs in preserving nature.

===subject:Tough decision
===message:The first factor that affects my opinion on the special rights of Native Americans is history.  Native Americans are citizens of the United States not because their grandparents emigrated but because an invading force conquered them.  To argue whether the invasion and subsequent conquest was right or wrong is of importance when determining the rights and privileges of a class of people.  There is no greater certainty than night must follow day.  In saying that, I am a firm believer in the power of cause effect, not only in physical processes but also in social phenomena.   While many individuals that come from hostile environs become successful measured on any scale, the reality is that systemic forces are an overwhelming impediment to the goals and aspirations of many.  Native Americans fall within a class that has been systematically disenfranchised by the United States.  The treatment of Native Americans during and after the initial conquests of North America was barbaric.  For example, Native Americans were resettled to reservations and culturally reeducation at orphanages.  The consequences of such actions are felt today by almost all Native American tribes.  As a result of the history of Native Americans in the United States, their status as a protected class with peculiar and extended rights is generally accepted.  Similarly, I understand the Makah to have the same peculiar and extended rights because of the historical legacy as Native Americans.  Consequently, I’m inclined just from evaluating this factor to accept the Makah’s right to hunt whales.  
Second, how the special rights effect the population is of concern.  Specifically, are there direct or indirect consequences to their special rights?  With regard to the Makah, will their whaling deplete or adversely affect the gray whale?  Will they through whaling disrupt the gray whales mating or feeding cycles?  Will they adversely affect not only the gray whale but also other species?  Moreover, will the Makah while whaling adversely affect the habitat?  This appears to be from the article an unsettled question.   
Another area of concern related to the environmental consequences of whaling is the political consequences.  Dunagan mentions a host of interests allied against the Makah’s resumption of whaling.  One must evaluate their position and reasoning and determine how valid is their argument against the Makah’s whaling.  Is their argument based upon some fringe ideology, or is a mainstream philosophy?  Are the opposing organizations powerful actors?  Are the organizations serious about fighting the Makah’s legal right to hunt whales, or are their statements rhetorical in substance?  The political fallout is of importance.  Will other groups wish for the Makah’s status as a protected class of individuals?  
The last factor centers upon International agreements.  It must be ascertained what our obligations are under International treaties.  Moreover, what will the political consequences of Makah whaling entail for current and future international agreements?  Will other nation-states cite such exemptions for other classes of individuals in their polity?
While I lean on the side of the protection of the Gray whale, if it can withstand the limited whaling that the Makah intend, I see no problem in allowing a people to continue a tradition that has been a part of their culture for two thousand years.

The second reason is that Native American tribes are independent Nations inside the United States territory, legally, so they don't need to comply to U.S. laws. The Makhas don't receive federal Funds for being push around, the have always being there where they are. Even if they did, the U.S. should pay them, or return their land, isn't that what we do with many of the territories in the pacific, and Puerto Rico?

Let this tradition continue andlet the tribe decide how and whne it should change. They are Native Americans and have a right to life ,liberty justice and the opportunity to hunt whale for religious belief.

===message:Native Americans are one of the most deprived groups in our beloved country, there are at the bottom of the poverty list and rank high alcohol consumption list. This country has stereotyped these people from savages on John Wayne movies to laughable characters in profesional sports orginazation (Alanta Braves, Washington Redskins). However this particular tribe in good faith for religious conetation and pride for their culture are hunting whale to gain more spirutaulity and to connect with a higher being.

The government of our nation has agreed to let this tribe continue this tradition since 1855 and the tribe itself stopped when the certains whale seemed to be exstinct.

===message:I personally have no problem with the hunting of one gray whale for traditional Makah purposes, but I have to agree with a point raised in Capt. Dave's reply questioning the motives behind such an expedition.  Is this a case of certain tribe elders trying to prove something to their tribe in the face of the US Government, or do they truly believe that a return to a traditional hunt such as this will set a good example for Makah youth? <p>

The gray whale is NOT on the endangered species list any longer.  It was on the list for the last nearly 50 years due to overharvesting.  It has returned to sustainable levels, and the taking of one whale for a culturally significant purpose that the Makah have presented is ok in my book.  We must be careful, however, as the federal government could be unknowningly opening up a can of worms.  Just 3 months ago, Japan raised major issues with the International Whaling Commission over not being able to hunt a limited number of a certain kind of non-endangered whale in its waters.  The Commission said no, much to the Japanese people's chagrin, and the Japanese Government continues to fight for the right to hunt.  Whale meat is an extremely expensive delicacy that certain rich Japanese would like to get their hands on, and they are not going quietly.  The reason I metion this is because if the US allows the Makah to take even this one whale, that will undoubtedly fuel other requests for exceptions in international whaling regulations. <p>

Finally, since the Makah volutarily stopped whaling 70 years ago, even though their treaty provisions allowed for it (although I'm sure it would have been invalidated by international regulations), I believe that the Makah are genuinely concerned for the rights of animals, including the whale.  They would not be pushing for the right to kill one if so doing would harm the population as a whole.  There is validity in the argument that this is a part of their ancient tradition, and I believe they should "quietly" be allowed to pursue it.

===message:I'm going to disagree with the majority, and say that I don't think whale hunting should be allowed.  I realize that this is part of the Makah culture, but if they are allowed to carry on this tradition what other doors will we be opening?  My point is, if we allow the Makah tribe to carry on this tradition what will keep other tribes and religious groups from fighting for other and perhaps more extreme rights?  I believe that when the Makah use to hunt whales before it was for a food and was a way of life.  Obviously they've survived without it all these years and I don't see the point in brutally hunting an innocent animal for "tradition".
Also, what will happen when other cultural issues come up?  For instance, slavery.  That was a part of the american culture and was a way of life for many.  But just because it was a part of our past doesn't mean it has to be a part of our lives now.  Whale hunting may not seem so bad to some, but where do you draw the line?  When these traditions start affecting more "valuable" animals, or perhaps humans?  Just because the whale isn't endangered doesn't mean making a sport out of taking its life isn't wrong.

===message:This is a hard one.  Based on principal alone a treaty was signed with the Mahah people.  We should hold true to the treaty and honor their request.  Back in 1855 whale hunting was probably not an issue and this request seemed valid.  Because of our promise we can not now take back our word.  As far as the nontraditional equipment used in 1855 that is another flaw made by us in not recoqnizing advancement in weapons in the treaty.  I do agree if there is a more humane way to kill that should be encouraged.

===message:People all over the world have various ritualistic practises.  Some go to church on Sundays, some on fridays; some eat lamb's meat, some eat whatever, and yet, nobody complains about it.  Nobody complains about judaic religion, when its followers eat lamb's meat.  Why complain about the Indians?
The Pilgrims came to this country in search for religious freedom, and that is something we should hold on to.  Native indians did this (hunting) long before immigrants came to this country and should be left to carry on with their rituals, it is long overdue.

===message:The way I see it is that the Native Americans are just exercising their beliefs and religions.  The first amendment gives all people in this country the right to view and act on their religions the only way they know how.  Besides, if they want to hunt whales with little spears, that's their own business, all it'll do is piss off the whales even more.

===message:Personally, I see no problem with the Makah (or other tribes for that matter) continuing hunting practices considered sacred to their tribe.  As long as the animal species is not endangered, they should be allowed to carry out their hunting.  Although many disagree with hunting this specific animal, how would the general public feel if all of a sudden deer or duck hunting were banned.  Granted, this is different because these species are far from endangered and more abundant in nature, but my point is that it is a practice that many families may consider sacred to their culture.  Plenty of people also disagree with this sort of hunting but I do not see it being banned anytime soon.<br>

I agree that the hunting procedures should be as humane as possible (which the article indicates is the case), so I really do not see what the fuss is about (the animal's gentleness, intelligence, etc. should not be an issue).  As I said, as long as the species is not in danger of extinction, I feel the tribes should have the rights given to them long ago- haven't we screwed enough tribes in regards to treaties?

===message:This was an interesting topic to think about.  On one hand, the Macah tribe has a long tradition which they voluntarily gave up when the whale became endangered.  Now that the whale is off the endangered species list, many people view the hunt as being okay, because of the treaty giving permission for the hunt and the fact that it is in the name of spirituality.  My opinion lies on the other side of the matter.  I don't believe that the Macah tribe should be given special privileges.  Granted, I don't know a great deal about whaling or the whaling industry, but the potential for an ever-widening loophole seems to be there.  Yes, this is a spiritual quest and not a commercial expedition, but surely this tribe has other ceremonies and ways to express their spirituality.  The whale hunt might be a tradition, but it's a thing of the past and should stay that way.

===message:I feel if the Makhas want to teach thier young about the history and traditions of thier ancestors they should be allowed to.This would be a great learning experience for any young tribe member.They would be able to live the experience not just read about it or hear about it from the elder tribe members. I also don't think they are planning to go into the whaling industry. Being from Connecticut I know it would be much more profitable to open a casino. Look at Foxwoods and The Mohegen Sun.
