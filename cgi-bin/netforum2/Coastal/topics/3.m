===subject:Who should pay for insurance? (a hard decision)
===message:The topic of coastal insurance is very frustrating to me.  I have a hard time picking a side about who should pay for insurance when people choose to live or work on the coast.  
But with careful consideration I have decided that the ones who choose to live there should pay coastal insurance.  I think this can go for individuals who live on a flood plain, also. The reason why I feel this way for coastal areas especially because if people have enough money to build on the coast they should have enough money to afford there own insurance.  And if they can't afford this expensive insurance then they shouldn't build on the coast.  <p> Dr. Schmidt made an excellent comment about remembering that the same question can be asked about people building in flood plains, people who engage in occupations such as farming, and other areas of life where insurance and risk protection are important. I think that it's a good point especially since many of us are from the Midwest and that are opinions may be bias since we don't live on the coast.  As I said before I feel that same rule about who should pay for insurance should be applied for individuals living in the flood plains. But I think a farmer and a hotel owner are completely different.  Farmers should get help with insurance and hotel managers should not. Farmers provide food directly or indirectly by growing crops for us or animals we eat.  We depend on farmers; we would die if we didn't have food.  We would not die if hotel managers were no longer in business and we are certainly not dependent on wealthy hotel owners to live.  <p>  The electronic reader suggested that insurance is very expensive in risky areas.  I think that insurance companies should be some what controlled by governments.  I think that insurance companies can get way out of control with their prices and that they can take advantage of drastic events.  I also think another good point that Ms. Fussel, from the FWUA, made is that, "people living farther inland and people who make their homes more hurricane-safe (should) pay less."  I think that homeowners should be awarded for building hurricane-safe homes.  <p> As I mentioned before this topic is very perplexing and difficult to make a final judgment.  The important thing to remember is that these buildings, many too close to the coastal edge, don't have to be there and who ever choose to live or work there should have to suffer the consequences.

===subject:Who pays for Insurance?
===message:This is a difficult question to answer.  The tourism industry is the life blood of Florida.  Without it unemployment would run rampant.  Since most of the industry is connected with the beaches, and those beaches present a high level of risk for the structures built there, it is only natural for beach investors to want their investments covered by insurance.  Should all of Flordia's population pay for insurance where a few are reaping a large profit?  That's difficult to say.  My opinion would be to have a general fund, like Florida does, and tax every dollar spent in the state for this fund. That way at least you would be taxing the people who use the hotels and beaches. Like I said in the beginning this is a difficult problem.

===subject:Who pays, who regulates
===message:The question of "who pays" seems to crop up in every facet of coastal policy. I think that if the government ponies up the funds to insure structures that are in high risk areas, they could set parameters on structural integrity, size, etc. so that they would not simply acquiesce to insure more exhorbitantly expensive buildings.  For example, knowing that mobile homes get completely demolished in the event of a Category 5, maybe statues discouraging mobile homes within a certain distance of the beach would keep the insurer from have to shell out for total losses. I also think that property taxes on this prime beach real estate should reflect, in part, the cost for government to insure these places. It seems like pretty simple economics; to get one amenity (access to high-demand beach real estate) one has to forgo another amenity (low property taxes.)  Perhaps some kind of hurricane building code would create structures with sufficient integrity that private insurers would be able to offer competitive insurance to places that have lowered their risk for destruction. In turn, by creating such an atmosphere, the pace of building and overdevelopment might slow, because compliance may lengthen the construction process.  In the case where an area is vulnerable to a known threat (e.g. incidence of damaging hurricanes) it may be a better use of tax dollars to proactively regulate at-risk property rather than continuing to look to the government as the sole source of insurance.

===subject:who pays
===message:The homeowner/business owner should bear responsibility for damages from hurricanes and the like.  They're the ones taking the risk of building out there, so they are the ones who need to take responsibility.  I do not agree with forcing other taxpayers to help these people rebuild.  The only exception I can think of is if someone has no other place to go (which, as the article said, was the original intent of the FWUA in Florida).  When someone takes a voluntary risk about where they want to live or how they want to make a living, the rest of us, as taxpayers, are not responsible for cleaning up after them if things go wrong.  I know this idea is unpopular here in Iowa too, as farm subsidies seem to be such a popular idea.  But farmers choose their occupation knowing the risks, and should clean up their own mess if they are not a success.  I think the same is true for people who build in a hurricane- or flood-prone area.

===subject:Discussion #2 Who Pays?
===message:I've had some time to think about this one since posting my response on the CoastalFree discussion board.  I'm still at the "hmmm" stage, but having said that, the answer that continually comes to mind this weekend is that we all pay for it, one way or another.  And yes, I'm referring to insurance, or federal and state subsidy money, whichever is the case.  Aesthetically we know we all lose.  There are some suggestions on a building distance limitation from the coast, however, those of us who have lived in such a region know that you are not safe from hurricane damage even inland.  Tornadic activity and torrential downpours can cause a tremendous amount of havoc and damage upwards of several hundreds of miles from the coast.  You do not have to be at ground zero to suffer from the effects of even the smaller Category 2 and 3 level storms.  I went through Hurricane Alicia while living in Houston, Texas in 1983.  I was 35 miles inland and there was extensive damage downtown from the 120+ mph winds and 24 hours of rain.  Speaking strictly for those areas that are immediately adjacent to the coast, all owners recognize the risks of being there.  They knew this before they built or before they purchased.  As a kid growing up and wandering loose on Galveston Island, the only homes I remember "on the beach" were of very modest construction, downright cheap actually, as everyone knew their lifespan could be shortened during any summer season.  Most of these were privately owned by local area surf fisherman and ardent beach lovers.  No one put the type of money being spent today into a beach cabin for weekend use that could be gone by next weekend!  Now, life at the beach is different.  It is luxurious, comfortable, and for rent.  There is no limit to the money being invested in many beachfront or a canalfront homes as vacationers will pay up for that one week of use.  The average person can barely afford to rent in some areas much less expect to become an owner.  $350,000 buys you very little in a beachfront or waterfront home today.  Most new condos in the area of Florida that I lived in were starting at $200,000+ and these were nothing more than two bedroom apartments with seldom a view of anything spectacular.  They sell before the construction is complete.  Many are second homes placed in a rental programs to offset the cost of ownership.  I one for one grew tired of circling the coast of Florida via a boat and seeing barrier island after barrier island with hi-rise condos built on them.  It seems as if there is some misunderstanding about who benefits from bailing out or insuring these waterfront developments, it is not your average Joe American.  Folks who own that beachfront property typically tend to really dislike the public being behind their home.  Their purchases were intended to benefit them privately.  I'm not sure what the answer here should be as I wish no one to suffer financial losses, including those that have been successful in life, but at the same time I cannot find it in my heart to require the average citizenry of a state, and for that matter a nation, to bailout those who admittedly benefit from the lifestyle and knowing accepted the risks when they moved in.  And this in no way implies I'm not for disaster relief in terms of food and temporary shelters as we have a strong civic duty to help those in need, but I am strictly dealing with reconstruction contributions via John Q. Public.  I think it is a personal decision to choose to live in a coastal region, or on a hillside in California where mudslides can occur, and therefore it is one's personal responsibility to protect one's own assets.  If you can't afford the insurance, or can't get insurance, the property values will and should reduce to a level that possibly John Q. Public can afford to buy in someday.  As a society we cannot afford to protect everyone from everything, including their own irresponsibility.  No one reimbursed the millions of stockholders from the last 18 months of the stockmarket, not to bring up another bad subject...smile.  Life is a risk, accept it.  Lastly, if we are going to spend taxpayer money in these areas, at least let's buy back our coastline and let the folks move back to the mainland, and inland; while giving mother nature a chance to survive herself and protect us in the process.

===subject:Ummm... duh? 
===message:Maybe it seems all too obvious to me, but I think that in general that anyone who is receiving benefits from an associated risk (such as putting houses near hurricane prone areas) should pay for the costs that come with said risk. Although there are areas in our society that need society to collectively pool together money for certain causes such as welfare, I don't believe that coastal insurance should be one of them as the benefits here are clearly concentrated on those that are living on the beaches. Yes, there may be some economic reasons for the state of Florida that could be seen as collectively good for the entire state, but I still think that those who are using those areas should make up the costs associated with them.

===message:Who pays? That is a very tough question.  Generally most people are taught to help someone in need, but you can't help everyone.  It is clear there is some risk no matter where you live for instance; there happens to be many large, old trees around the house I live in, if by chance one were to be struck by lighting or caught in a strong wind it could very well fall down and damage my house, a risk I must take and a risk everyone takes in some form or another.  Placing a house or business on a very vunerable shore in a place likely to be hit by a hurricane is not a risk that needs to be taken, I am not saying not to do it, if I had the money I know I would but I wouldn't expect someone else to pick up the tab when it fell down.  Coastal buildings must exist whether for commercial use or recreational use and must have some sort of protection if and only if the lowest risk, or near to, area is chosen.  If somebody decides to build on some dirt they tossed into the water hoping it would serve as a good foundation thinking it wouldn't sink (like the Kansai International Airport in Japan) then they are on their own.

Putting the burden on taxpayers is the wrong thing to do, period. Especially since some of the property on the coast is un-godly expensive, only the wealthy can afford it anyway. You can enjoy all of the wonderful benefits of living on the coast, the scenery, the weather, the sound, ect... but you also are taking a major risk by living in this area, a risk that is well documented. You should be expected to pay all damage costs yourself, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. My relatives in Myrtle Beach live a mile off the coast in their condo. They could not afford the ridiculous property prices to build along the coast-only the affluent in the area can... and they knew the closer they were to the coast, the less likely they were to get insurance. My family considered buying a cheaper home for a summer home to visit, but after Hurricane Birtha hit, we knew we were taking a risk by buying this beach home with no insurance. We took the smart route and opted to stay at my relatives. We still enjoy the costal area benefits every day, without worrying about ripping off the taxpayers of the state.

not have to pick up the slack and insure when private 
insurance doesnt.  People who choose to live in these 
high risk areas should understand that paying high 
premiums in insurance is part of the lifestyle.  People 
should know that a hurricane is going to strike sooner 
or later.  The 10 percent of floridas high risk population 
should be incharge of making sure they are covered.  it 
is a privilage to live on the coast and people need to 
realize this and stop taking it for granted.

===message:In Florida there are those who have chosen (and paid mightly for the priviledge) to enjoy life on the beach and for this group I feel that they should pay their own way in terms of insurance. However those who purchased in the era of the cheaper, throwaway type home, as mentioned by Dave Hutchison should have an access to some aid if they are now living on fixed incomes. Another facet of this problem is the business of tourism which supplies the other jobs in the state. Everyone has an economic interest in keeping these operating. This is not a one size fits all solution. I think that in view of the potential for rising sea level and the dramatic changes possible along the Florida coast as this takes place, it would be wise to begin the strategic retreat now. If structures are damaged beyond repair, they are purchased at market value (prior disaster)by the state or local government and turned into public parks with low cost, expendable construction (restrooms, picnic benches...). If the damage does not render a structure unusable then repair requirements could follow a type FEMA has encouraged along the Mississippi River with break-away bottom floors which allow storm surge to flow through with minimal damage to the upper part of the structure. If one did follow new codes and build a more protected structure, you would qualify for the insurance pool if none else was available. To this pool however, I would add a condition similar to our earthquake insurance rules. The insurance only kicks in after a 10 - 15% deductable which is paid by the owner. This helps protect the insurance pool and does help discourage building in areas subject to risk. For businesses a lower deductable would be possible if they had a tax which went into their insurance pool.

<p>
Industry and tourism really have no cause to whine about higher insurance costs because chances are they will pass the costs off to the consumer anyway in some form.  In addition, corporations may be subsidized in the form of tax breaks for developing in such an area in first place.  So, basically all of us are potentially paying for any higher insurance costs of industry along the coastline.  
<p>
As for residential builders along the coastline, what is the dynamic of these people?  I mean isn't coastal property, especially in Florida, expensive?  So though all Floridians are subsidizing the cost of insurance for those who maintian property in high risk areas, they shouldn't have too.  There are risks that can and should be assumed when residing along coastlines and if those people spent half an ounce of energy to research their property choice they would understand that for them to follow through would mean that they and they alone assume any future problems/damage.

===message:It seems that it is obvious that the cost of high-risk insurance for coastal dwellers, making up 10% of the constituents of the state of Florida, should not be bore by the other 90% of residents and businesses that have not built in high-risk areas.<p>

Those people who choose to build businesses and live on the coast, with all of its splendid beauty, should also be prepared to pay the costs. They are obviously at much higher risk for hurricane and flood damage, and should therefore be prepared to pay the higher premiums necessary for insurance. It is certainly not fair that those premiums be spread throughout the state. Since the FWUA is supposed to be charging enough in premiums to cover their costs when claims come rolling in during hurricane season, FWUA should be raising the premiums to those they insure.<p>

Another side benefit can also been seen: if the cost of developing so near to the coast becomes prohibitive enough, it should significantly reduce the number of dwellers there. This could turn to become a great thing in the long run, if most people are unable to develop too close to the coast, and are forced to develop much further inland due to financial reasons, then they won't be placed in a position where they feel like they have to build seawalls, groins, et. al. to protect their assets. This, in the long run, would save our beaches, and not cause the host of problems we read about in Chap. 3 that results from attempts at engineering the coasts.<p>

Since it is almost inevitable that developments too close to the coast will eventually be subject to natural erosion processes, I feel that costs of doing such development, esp. in terms of insuring that development, should become so expensive as to discourage most people from wanting that property. Who knows, super high insurance premiums may be another factor that could help to save our beaches, in the long run?

===message:It is clear to me that if one has enough money to build along our nation's coastline, they should also have enough money to pay for the insurance to live there.  That has to be a longterm cost consideration for anyone who is thinking of building on the coast.  If it isn't, it is simply irresponsible and unrealistic of that person to neglect such cost considerations.  The idea of government subsidizing insurance for these people is ludicrous in my opinion.  So many of these coastal homes are expensive, plush mansions; I hate to think the government would consider subsidizing such properties. <p>

There is a major difference in considering who should pay for residential coastal insurance and considering whether farming and fishing operations should receive federal bailout dollars.  It has been the government's policy since WWII to ensure that Americans have cheap food on the country's grociery store shelves.  If farming/fishing wasn't subsidized, consumer food costs would skyrocket.  In addition, so would unemployment; not only would small farmers be out of work, but the resulting chain reaction would spread to local elevators, co-ops, implement dealerships, etc.  Not to mention that small town rural life as we know would cease to exist.  Food production is a necessary part of life, and if a portion of our tax dollars have to be paid to keep food costs down and to provide jobs for millions of Americans, then so be it.  People who choose to live on the coast are not forced to do so.  They know the risks of living in such areas and the costs associated with doing so.  They should be the ones bearing the brunt of these costs. <p>

I also was thinking about zoning policy, and I see that someone else posted a message along the same lines.  Whenever a hurricane hits hard, I always see pictures of destroyed mobile homes on TV.  Why not prohibit mobile homes in certain high risk areas within a certain distance from the coast?  That would seem to be an easy policy to implement to prevent certain destruction in strong hurricanes and tropical storms.

===message:Who pays after destruction of property,loss of lives,dreams and hopes after a natural disaster on the coast. I believe the answer to that is the taxpayer. Building modest to luxury homes and business in a high risk natural area is a major concern, because there is a greater chance of your property to be destroyed.This oponion was address in Florida where insurance companies have higher premium to those who live on the coast and less to those who live further inland. This is justification because home and business owners have a choice to build on the coast or further in the city. One should expect higher property  taxes and higher premium to live in an exclusive area on the coast. Although we are not able to predict when a natural disaster will arise, we do know by history that it will happen and some property and lives may be lost. Insurance companies are  gaining a monumental profit because "we the people" chose to build near the coast. The government should not have to pay for property damages to someone's property when they chose to live near a natural disaster area. The people are responsible for the   property loss and paying back of monies to disaster relief funds to rebuild and refurbish homes and business when hurricanes arrive and destroy. Ironically if the government who are elected "by the people for the people" decides to abolish all homes or business within a "100 mile radius" of the beach, because of natural disaster concerns, then those officials would be promply  voted out of office becuase you are depriving Americans of there most valuable assest, and that is entertainment,fun, and relaxation on the coast. Therefore if the people of Florida or in the United States do not urged there legislator to ban all business and homes with in 100 mile radius or further from coastal areas to prevent hurrincanes and storms from killing people and damage of property, then it should be the people who should pay higher taxes and premiums to the insurance companines and to the government to rebuild and refurbish loss properties and compensation for loss of lives.

If you decide to build (as a homeowner, businessowner, or any other developer) on or within danger of the coast, you should assume any risk.  I think it sends a good message when insurance companies duck out and decide not to insure spots nearest the coast- it is almost a given that a storm will hit the area in the near future and cause large amounts of damage.  Hopefully insurers are sending a message that will discourage  building.<br>

However, I do not feel that this small percentage (around 10%) should alone assume all the risk.  The businesses generate a lot of revenue that ends up benefiting those not on the coast.  While many Floridians may not live near the coast and therefore suffer damage to their homes, they do benefit from the successes of coastal businesses in an indirect way.<br>

Summing up, I feel that the owners of property and business on the coast should assume most of the risk and insurance costs.  However, I'm sure there is a way an actuariast can figure out who else benefits from coastal development and work out insurance costs accordingly.

===message:<p>I am trying to decide what kind of car I want to buy.  I have the following choices:

<OI>
<LI>Purchase a sports car.  A fast red Porsche</LI>
<LI>Purchase a Ford Focus.  Blue with black interior</LI>

<p>I am a very bad driver.  I am highly prone to get into accidents.  In fact, I live along some of the most dangerous roads in America.  Everyone around me is almost guaranteed to get in some accident, with varying levels of seriousness, at some time in the next few years.  What can I say, we are just bad drivers.

<p>The Porsche is my dream car.  Isn’t it the American dream to be driving down the road with the wind soaring through your hair?  Insurance is a pain.  If I buy the red Porsche, I just can’t get insurance.  The combination of my bad driving and the bad drivers around me make it impossible for me to afford.  Of course Geico (not Gecko) is willing to insure me if I’ll pay the cash.  But you know, I’m a poor college student who can barely afford the Porsche.

<p>On the other hand, I can the Ford Focus.  It is a modest mobile.  I will not be cruising around impressing the ladies, but I will be able to afford insurance.  The Ford Focus isn’t the American dream (no ill directed towards those who drive one).   

<p>So, using the same logic as beach homeowners, I buy the Porsche and expect some sort of deal on insurance.  It’s a beautiful car, why should I have to drive it without insurance?

<p>Beach home owners (my family included) are ridiculous if we think we should be able to build on the coast yet get some deal on insurance.  This is the way it works:

<LI>You choose to do a risky behavior.  (Build a home)</LI>
<LI>You choose to do so in a high risk region. (A beach home at that)</LI>
<LI>Insurance companies calculate your risk, pool it among a given population, and take your payments.</LI>
<LI>If you can’t afford the payments, you lose your insurance.</LI>

<p>Anyone developing along the coast has the choice of a Porsche or a Focus.  Build on the coast, fulfill your dream, a big home/Porsche and pay a ton in insurance or just don’t carry insurance (your own risk, unlike a car accident you aren’t hitting someone else).  If everyone does this, insurance is high for those who try and pay.  Another choice, cut back on your building/Focus and be able to pay insurance.  If everyone does this, the pool across regions reduces insurance rates (not to mention the lower values of our developments = lower insurance costs).

<p>The government has no business in insuring people who build homes that are likely to be obliterated after the next hurricane.  Though this logic carries along similar lines to farming subsidies, it is like bailing Kmart out after one too many Blue Light specials.

===subject:Who pays?
===message:I think the question of who pays in these types of disasters definately depends on the circumstances.  I, for one, do not believe that wealthy people should build luxury homes in the path of tropical storms and then expect other people to pay when their home is destroyed.  Those people are taking a calculated risk and it should be up to them to pay for the damages.  However, farming is a different side of the story (and I'm probably biased since I've lived in Iowa my entire life).  Good farm land is disappearing fast and if it happens to lie in a flood plain, it should still be used.  Farming benefits the entire nation, in fact, it benefits the entire world.  On the other hand, I have never benefited from a multi-million dollar home built in a beach in Miami!

===subject:Who Pays?
===message:All taxpayers pay for the few who either live in the expensive homes on the coast or make thier living from resorts,restaurants,etc. on the beach. All the Insurance policy holders also pay when a natural disaster strikes. Insurance companys pay out huge amounts of money for the relitivly few in the coastal areas. The tax payers and insurance policy holders should not have to cover the cost for the few who chose to build in unstable areas.In auto insurance if you are a high risk drive you can't get insurance, I don't see the difference between them and high risk homeowners.  I wonder how many people would build on the coast with no insurance?
