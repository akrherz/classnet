===more:<p>Optional and final posting question.  What is the most interesting coastal experience you have had? <b>We are not interested in sex or alcohol (at least not in terms of what you post here!).</b>We want to know about interesting places you've been, (terrible or wonderful and great stuff) things you've seen or experienced in a coastal area. If you are "coast deprived" where would you love to go coast-wise and why?
