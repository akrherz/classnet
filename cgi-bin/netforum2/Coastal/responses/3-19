===message:The problem with determining who should pay is difficult because we all take from the seas in some way.  People that reside near the coastline, tourist that continually visit the coastal areas, and developers that profit from construction projects.  

The problem with insuring coastal residents is twofold:  the residents pay initially as the rest of the cost gets passed along to the rest of us.
