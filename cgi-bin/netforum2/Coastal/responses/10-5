===message:What should we do to handle this problem?  The first thing that needs to be done is to become as highly educated on the topic that we can.  This could be a huge problem for other species.  A couple of the major problems would be competition for living and for food to survive.  There needs to be some sort of system where they could detect exotic species, and this would be a tough project to eliminate.  Exotic species probabley can't be eliminated, but it can be reduced.  As, I stated above the more educated we are on the topic the more that can be accomplished to eliminating the species.  I'm willing to guess that the general public probably doesn't know much on this topic because you just don't hear anything about these kind of problems.  These problems should be known by everyone because one way or the other everyone is affected by the coastal waters.  We need to do more research on this topic, or maybe try to set up some sort of patrol system.

===subject:Introduction of non-native species

===message:It always seems to be that people only become serious about a problem when it occurs. There never seems to be any pre-emptive planning or action among leaders or officials concerning potential problems.  We have had problems with the introduction of non-native species since this country opened up for business.  Contemporary examples of this would be the introduction killer bees from South America to the U.S. and Zebra mussels into our waterways and coastal areas. Without any natural predators invasive species are able to spread and disrupt native systems (e.g., water weeds choking intercoastal waterways).  
<p>
There is no resolution to this problem.  As long as ships fly flags of convenience (FOC) monitoring ships will be hard to track and inspect. Even if we are able to inspect all the ships and goods coming into this country somebody will miss something. The only way to deal with this problem is to monitor all waterways and ports worldwide and anticipate problems and intervene when problems occur early.  Pre-emptive actions are good but maybe if we tried to manage potential problems rather than try to control all possibilities we might be able to establish realistic policy and planning to deal with problems concerning invasive species.

===message:As stated previously, it is neigh on impossible to prevent foreign species from being unknowingly and ignorantly transported into places where they can thrive.  This is a natrual phenomenon, 'survival of the fitest' as Darwin would call it.<br><br>

Only through vigilence, education, and participation can such a problem be avoided, yet most Americans appear to be either too ignorant or too lethargic to do anything about it.  Regulations and rules are also seemingly useless, since they would be next to impossible to enforce.<br><br>

Guess the best answer is that there is no good answer.  This needs to be made important to those using these waterways for recreation and business alike, and until then, the matter will only get worse.

===message:I must admitt that I was ignorant to the fact that this was going on and also that it was such a problem.  This being said I think that a general awarness is one possible answer to these alien species coming into ecosytems that are unable to handle that particular species.<p> It seems as though this is a type of problem that is going to aquire much attention and money.  If you think about how many ships and cargo vessels are roaming the sea's, it becomes a huge task. What then is the answer to the problem?  I dont think that their is one right answer.  I guess the only thing to do is to keep researching the problem and constantly being aware of the potential harm that could occur.
