===message:I'll agree that the overuse of natural resources and lack of attention on the future is a tremendous problem.  Overharvested fisheries and pollution from industry have been a huge detriment to the waters of the world.  I'd like to add to that however.  These problems can be traced to who "owns" the coastal waters.  There is so much ambiguity in who controls and who is responsible for the health of our bodies of water.  Local, regional, and national governments all battle for the rights to the benefits, but everyone points the finger elsewhere when it comes to the responsibility of cleanup.  Once we all become collectively responsible a lot of other problems can be solved down the line.

===message:I agree that many are not willing to take responsibilities for their actions towards the damage man imposes upon costal areas.  However, I do not agree that everyone knows what is at risk.  I believe their is a lack of knowledge, an ignorance, that exists about what effects man has on the coastal areas.  Granted there are numerous NGOs that clearly express the threat to governments and to citizens.  But, as stated in chapter 1, many would rather turn their attention away and be ignorant.  If people were to look at the trends and effects scientifically and in relation to long term they would see a lack of responsibility and the need for serious change.  It is ironic that people who merely want to revel in a beach's or coast line's beauty are the ones who are destroying it.
