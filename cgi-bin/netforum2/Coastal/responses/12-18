===message:Jacob raises an interesting argument that I have not heard before. Increased solar output playing a role in global warming would seem to indicate that perhaps the warming and cooling of the Earth is just part of a natural cycle. Woodward discusses in chapter 2 of Ocean's End how global warming affects ocean currents and circulation (see bottom p.52 - 54). Salinity and temperature affect water density and thus the movement of oceanic currents around the world.<p>"Some scientists believe that a slowing of ocean circulation is the switch that triggers ice ages........a sensible fail safe mechanism for the Earth's climate" (Woodward, 54).<p> I feel it entirely plausible that global warming and cooling is simply part of the Earth's natural defenses. When the Earth becomes too warm (at least in some part due to human activities), glaciers begin to form and the world enters an ice age to cool things down. So perhaps regardless of what we humans do to try and combat global warming, Mother Earth herself will step in and "fix" things. Unfortunately this will be to the severe detriment (extinction) of the human species. But perhaps this is simply a part of a cycle that will occur regardless of what we do. Maybe we are in the midst of an earthly cycle to enormous we cannot comprehend that our existence is merely a miniscule part that was intended to be eradicated all along.
