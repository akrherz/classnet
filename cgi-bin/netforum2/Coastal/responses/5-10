===message:Ideally I would have a beach that would have no development on it and would not be armored.  But that seems to not exist in many cases today, and if it does it is still in one way or another affected by either a jettie or groin to the north or south or by a dam inland that blocks sediment.  The first thing that I would do had I been placed in charge of a beach that had already been somewhat developed would be to determine a "developement zone" this would be the line that would be inland enough that it would be healthy for the beach to build behind, this would be far behind the dunes and although it would create a walk for sunbathers to reach the beach it would be the only place where from that point and inland new development could take place.  Between that point and the water would be the "no zone" and that area would have to be evalutated in terms of current insurance, taxes, erosion, population, amount of development, etc. as to how to deal with the current area.  From there policy would be made as to the creation of a healthier beach and how to over time return the beach to as normal of a state as nature would have intended without endangering the town.  Another consideration would be if any armor was currently fixed off shore or off the beach. These would slowly be weened off given it would not increase the erosion of the beach and/or of surrounding beaches.  Also information would be taken on any current problems our beach was creating for others.  This information would be taken every year and reviewed every year in order to appropriate for any needed changes or withdrawls of policy options.
