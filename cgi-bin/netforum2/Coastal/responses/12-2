After reading research and talking to various individuals I believe that global warming is occurring.  If this is a natural phenomena and it is occurring then I can see no possibility to reverse its effect.  As a naturally occurring phenomena it is neither good nor bad it is simply an natural phenomena that probably occurs in cycles.  Some people believe global warming is caused by emissions generated by the consumption of fossil fuel and related technologies.  
<p>
Let?s say that global warming is cyclical.  Human emissions may exacerbate and accelerate the global warming trend so fast and intensely that civilizations may not have time to cope.  Global warming may increase sea levels so fast that coastal cities and countries (e.g., Maldives) will be subsumed. Also our influence may effect the warming trend to such a degree that any cooling, compensating mechanisms in the cycle that occur later will be overcome leading to an ever increasing run-away global warming trend.  The extinction of species is a natural phenomena.  If we can?t adapt or care about our species enough to ensure our own survival maybe we should make way for a more evolved species.
<p>
On a positive note, if our agricultural zones change and if we can cope with the transition  we can still maintain a strong agriculture and hostile nations that can?t cope will be annhilated.  So be patriotic buy an SUV and Hit the Gas!

===message:To be honest I have never known much about Global Warming when I was younger or even now.  In high school I remember going over this topic very quickly and I didn't retain anything.  Now that I have read and become more knowledgable I have come to the conlcusion that Global Warming is a natural phenomenon and what can be done do stop it.  It's a major event that effects the earth and us that live in it.  I think the best answer to my opinion is to be educated in this area, maybe even start in junior high with classes about Global Warming and all of the problems that we have discussed the will make the general public more aware of this particular situation.  I think it's bad that global warming raises the sea level and they say that cities and even more can be engulfed.  If this were to happen what would we do.  Probably not to much because what would you really do, this is unheard of.  So what do we do with global warming.  I think we are all worried about other isssues such as war as one of the other discussion postings reported.  I think we should be worried about war (nuclear and other major problems), but this is a major problem that could be really bad if there isn't much done about it.

===message:Global warming is a topic that has been debated by just about everyone that is intrested in the environment.  Global warming, I beleive is a very real occurence.  Nobody is going to convince me that as much CFC's that we produce and emit into the environment dosen't have an effect on the earth's temperature.  I believe that some people feel that global warming is something that environmentalist came up with to stop the emission of certain types of pollutants.  However their is substantal scientific evidence that proves golbal warming is happening.  I think  countries realized the potential impact of global warming because many signed the Montreal Protocol that phased out  CFC's.  Which if you think about it will end up costing them money in the beginning because they have to come up with the new technology to decrease the emmisions.  The point being that countries usually think of the economic side effects first and then the problem second.  In this case people realize how important it is to adress the issue of global warming.  <p>To me I don't think it is a question if global warming is happening, but what is the end result if we continue to warm our earth's temprature.  Colin Woodard in chapter two shows us what is currently taking place in the Antarctic.  I belive this is one example that needs to be taken very seriously when proponents argue against global warming.
