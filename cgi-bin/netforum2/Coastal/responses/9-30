===message:i kind of like to think of our world as having a top and a bottom.  the ocean has more species than land they just get screwed cause some ignorant humans dump all their shit into their "air"  what if the roll was reversed?  even then i dont think the bottom part of the world would trash us like we trash them.  they could enjoy catching us for dinner but there are too many of us in the first place.. i'd like to see humans become extinct from a cause not created by themselves.

===message:You make a good point.  Unfortunately, it's human nature to destroy ourselves.  Countless civilizations have done it.  We seem to think we're invinsible...time will tell.
