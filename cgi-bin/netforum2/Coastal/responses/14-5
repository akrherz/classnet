===message:<p>My family owns a home on the beautiful Emerald Isle (home of Atlantic Beach) and several of my relatives live or own homes on the Outer Banks (Ocracoke, Duck).  Visiting the area is quite a treat.

<p>Sadly, the area has changed so much even in the last decade.  The recent boom in Raleigh of wealthy New Yorks (read Cary = containment area for relocated yankees) has led to a surge in coastal development.  When I was a kid we would walk through the dune sands to get to the beach near our house.  Now, a tall wooden walkway has been constructed (and reconstructed numerous times following storms).  Just the introduction of these walkways have changed the structure of the beach.

<p>hh...the Neuse river, one of the most vile things I have ever seen, full of hog crap.
