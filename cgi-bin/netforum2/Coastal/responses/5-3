===message:As governor I believe that to cease building on the coast would be impractical and that instead the education of coastal residents, developers, and politicians is the first step in addressing the issue. The vast majority of people are unaware of the problems that are caused by the development of the coast and the man-made structures (armoring) that come with development. Once people are educated and aware of the scope and depth of the issues, government regulation will not be as vital and necessary in saving the coasts. <p> I think that an integrated approach is the best way to regulate construction on the coast. Scaling back development to levels that are sustainable and  prohibiting construction in hazard areas are crucial to regulating construction on the coast. As a result of education and awareness, scaling back development to sustainable levels through building regulations and taxes, and prohibiting contruction in hazard areas, we will be able to preserve the natural defenses that Nature supplies to defend itself. <p>   Though the policies will be pain staking to initially inact, over the course of my term they will ultimately be more practical than eliminating coastal development altogether and cheaper than simply instituting regulations and higher taxes.  This integrated approach will make everyone a part of the solution- not only the tax payers, the politicians, or the developers. With everyone involved in the solution now, less people will be a part of the problem later.
