===message:To reiterate what Rachel has said, our bodies are composed of 70% of water.  We can't survive without it.  Our bodies also can't properly digest dirty and polluted water.  All of our water consumption comes from the lakes and oceans, and it's essential that it's clean and properly filtered.  The temperature of the ocean not only controls our weather patterns, it also controls the habitat of ocean life.  Mankind is the greatest predator, and we are preying on the animals of the sea in record numbers.  In far too many instances, we are destroying sea life little by little.  We're destroying the sea at an even greater pace than it regenerate itself.
