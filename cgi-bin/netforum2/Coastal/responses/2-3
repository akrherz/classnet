===message:Thanks for what you wrote! It made my day since I also believe that most of us do not know a lot about what's going on on the coastal areas of the world and the USA. <br> We do need to be better informed because the coastal zones are pretty important to a lot of the environmental and other aspects of life on this planet.<br> If you like shrimp or fish, if you like to sit on a beach, if you like to ocean fish, or swim in the sea, and so forth you may find these issues pretty interesting!
