===message:Marshall your response to Discussion #5 evoked some emotions in me that cannot go ignored.  I looked to see if you had posted under the "Who I Am" discussion, in an effort to get a little background, but I did not see your posting there.  The first half of your posting appears contradictory to me.  If you believe damage to the Black Sea was not motivated by greed then you and I have not read the same information in this course.  You imply countries bordering the Black Sea operate out of "economic" reasons and not "greed driven" and that the American system of Capitalism is unconcerned with secondary and tertiary consequences, only with making money, even if it is at the expense of the environment.  ???   Like everyone else, American farmers want better irrigation, commercial fishing fleets have exhibited a lack of concern for the environment and fish populations regardless of their national home base, Americans too appreciate cheaper electricity and oil drilling interests, world-wide, impact any region they are located in.   I remain confused how you see these same issues as less greed-driven near the Black Sea than those same activities here in the US.  What causes this dislike for American Capitalism in you?  We are concerned with many more "things" than your oversimplification of "the cheapest way to do something."  We are the world's leader in human rights, our technology is sought the world over, our industriousness elevates world standards for untold numbers of socio-economic classes, and we openly offer opportunities to the world to come here if they choose to, regardless of their religious, political, or economic beliefs.  Please find me one other country that has provided so many dollars in aid to other less fortunate countries.  Please find me another country that is willing to help those that are downtrodden and oppressed while promoting equality.  None of this implies we are perfect, but we cannot be faulted for at least making the effort.  Please show me other societies who have advanced themselves internally and yet who so voluntarily share their wealth in humanitarian efforts to the entire world with the knowledge that it is a gift and will likely never be repaid, even with a simple thank-you.  How can you possibly say we are only concerned with wealth?  However, we are thankful for the wealth and lifestyle we have earned and we take comfort in sharing it with others.  Why is it the rest of the world looks to us for help, and if given the opportunity, will send their children here for an education and many times a permanent relocation?  The success of Capitalism has provided all of this and so much more!  Politically we have done wonders providing a quality lifestyle for our citizenry and while yes, we have made some environmental (and social) mistakes, we are at least aware of the impact and dangers and able to freely discuss them as a nation without fear of government reprisals.  Our country is based on human rights and privileges, even IF we disagree with some of them, and yes, even to the detriment of the environment if need be in the short-term and until technology educates us to better means.  This is not a backing of environmental damage but a support of Americans to live autonomously within the guidelines of our Constitution and subsequent laws.  Politically, I do not think we are as environmentally derelict as you suggest.  Diverting the Danube from another nation is an act that is unforgiveable.  For sure, politically our system has its flaws, but we have a system that will respond if the constituency makes its concerns known.  Other nations are not so open-minded.  And we take this same concern to our neighbors in Canada and Mexico and consider our actions and how they may impact them.  This did not happen along the Danube.  Bottom line, I do not understand your position on the American economic and political system as negative motives in comparison to that of other nations.  I would suggest to you, that ALL nations are economically oriented and likely make decisions based on that interest alone, not on immediate impacts to the environment.  I agree with you that we are ignorant of our environment and that this must not last much longer.  And I agree with you dead zone level pollution could happen along more of our coastlines, as it is already documented to be a reality in the Gulf of Mexico.  I consider myself to be conservation and environmentally minded, I must also recognize and admit to myself that humans share this planet with many species under a variety of environmental conditions.  Life is dynamic, not static.  Evolution will not stop.  We have a right to be here and to blend in to our environment.  We will always utilize resources in one form or another, but we should learn to use them to our betterment only without damaging the ecosystem that supports our very existence.  Good luck in this course and please understand I offer up this defense of American policy with the kindest respect to your beliefs.  Capt. Dave
