===message:Yes, unfortunately, I do work indoors.  I have yet to do any field work, since my value is at the keyboard and not behind a shovel.  But, in 4 weeks (assuming I pass this class with a decent grade, hint, hint ;-) I will be graduating and moving on to other work, though I dont know yet where that will be, I just know that it will happen.
