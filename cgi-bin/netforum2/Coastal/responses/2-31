===message:it is true that americans tend to lead on the greedy side.  but do you think that is a consequence of our surroundings?  didnt WE create our country.  shouldnt WE have had some idea that "heaven" can't last forever?  i would place more of the blame on our lack of initiative to change what we have created.  i dont think people intentially want to destroy our beaches but i do think that they are aware of the situation/consequences and just don't do anything about it.
