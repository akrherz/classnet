===message:I have a hard time recognizing this as anything other than evolution.  To my way of thinking, it doesn't matter if a foreign or invasive species arrives on the winds of a storm, a change in current flow, on the back of a bird, or in a cargo hold of a ship.  Agriculture for years has dealt with the spreading of "invasive seeding" from the excrement deposited during bird migrations.  Mankind is a biological specie and our activities/movement will have an impact on the environment.  We have no other home to go to, so we must remain here, therefore, it is important to consider "ourselves" a part of nature.  Much like the bird that travels across state and national boundaries leaving residue containing unwanted seed, man's means of transportation, be it air, land, or sea, will eventually transport, what will inevitably be considered, unwanted contaminants into new areas.  In my most scientifically uneducated opinion, evolution respects the survival of the fittest, but it also appreciates and tolerates diversity, for at least a time.  You state species naturally go extinct and will migrate or invade other territory, but from what causes?  Climate, search of food, and natural movement are among the many reasons for this migration and/or extinction.  Is not man's impact a natural cause?  I propose that man and his activities are as much a part of this biological and environmental adjustment as any other species, thus leading to my thoughts towards evolution.  Our activities create acid rain, contaminated soils, polluted waters, and force the migration of species (including humans - Chernobyl, Bikini Atoll) to new locales, but the cause of these movements are no different be it a natural occurrence or self-inflicted.  Everything is a response to basic needs, desires, and wants, including those of non-human species.  I agree with you diversity is key to the maintainence for a variety of species to survive (but which species are to survive, as not all will indefinantly) and is beneficial for an ecological system to develop naturally.  But natural evolution seldom respects diversity in every aspect and tends to select a dominant specie(s) given the life-supporting capabilities of a specific region.  If new species are introduced [via human activity or otherwise] and they are more capable of surviving or adapting than the native species, is this then not evolution?  You are very correct, the problem is huge.  Great comments and thanks for making me think through this again!  Capt. Dave

===message:I think enforced regulation is the way to confront this problem.  We read about how damaging invasive species were to the Black Sea and heard about other problems in the video like giant jelly fish in the Gulf of Mexico, Zebra mussles in the Great Lakes, and Green Crabs in California.  It sounds like the program of "voluntary exchange" implemented by the Coast Guard where ships trade the water they picked up in "coastal waters" for water from "open waters" which have very few organisms is effective, except for the fact that it is voluntary.  I think requiring ships to do this is reasonable considering what is at stake.  For the ships that do not go into open waters (like the ones that use the Gulf of Mexico)- they should be required to have mandatory treatment.  Companies are working to come up with treatment systems that can better handle the problems of the huge volumes of water being dealt with and the slow rates at which these systems work.  It sounds like there are inconveniences for both treatment and exchange but if ships were required to do one or the other, they could choose which they thought was most cost-effective or realistic for their particular ship.  This way the dangers of non-native species being introduced would hopefully be reduced significantly.
