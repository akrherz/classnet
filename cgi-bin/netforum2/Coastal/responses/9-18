===message:I agree, I also would like to point out that by not caring about quality of the water we will drive the oceans to vast polluted deserts if we do not have some policy on how we should or should not treat our coastal cities, pollution management, fishing behavior, etc.  The temperature of water has already increased and as was stated in the book, with this increase an effect may be seen on such meterological staples as the Gulf Jet Stream.  If factors such as jet streams decrease it will lead to equitorial areas heating up and poles cooling down eventually leading to a melting of the poles and a possible repeated ice age...which leads into point number three, life in the ocean.  Unless we plan on becoming amphibious creatures we should care about the current ocean life and not only how it interlinks to us (our diet) but also as to how the extinction of a species could lead to disasterous affects for another species and so on until only half of the existing sea-faring citizens exist.
