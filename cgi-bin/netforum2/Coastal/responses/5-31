===message:I agree that construction on hte coastal areas should be limited. The carying capacity of htese areas has already been exceeded and people continue to move to the coast in staggering numbers- exploding counties video. The effects of massive constuction are painfully evident also. The environmental attractions of these areas are being destroyed because of overcrwding and unsustainable developmental practices. Tourism and development aer "bitibg off the hand that feeds them" through the severe exploitation of these fragile and complex areas. It is not practicle to have highly populous cities on the coastal areas for reasons of safety. In some larger cities the task of evacuating every citizen in case of a natural disaster is insurmountable. The occurrence of a natural disaster is also inevitable. Maybe something won't happen every year, or there won't be an incredibly bad storm in five years but it will happen.
