===message:Who cares?  I care since earth is covered by 71% of water.  This is more than half of earth.  How could you not care.  The book said that 80% percent of the population live near the coastal shores, and the is a big number so I think if you live in Iowa or on the coast you should care a great deal about the quality of water and the temperature.  There are many reasons why everyone should care such as the fishing industry wich is heavily relied on in the world. We get alot of oxygen from the large bodies of water.  There are numerous reasons to care about the oceans.  For someone to say that they don't care is an uneducated assumption on which they are not knowledgable.
