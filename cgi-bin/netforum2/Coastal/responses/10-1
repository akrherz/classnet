===message:The issues of invasive species are complex and do not lend themselves to clear-cut solutions, but I still believe that something must be done to handle the problem.<p> As Dave said, the first thought that ran through his mind was concerning Native American Indians. I too, had that same thought run through my head. In getting my Spanish major, one of my classes addressed the issues of the Native American Indians and the Conquest. The white man was a foreign invasive species, who brought with him diseases that wiped out thousands and thousands of indigenous people. This is a similiar scenario to the "invasive species" that we are talking about. <p> I must admit I do not know much about regulatory policies and therefore do not have many sound suggestions about how to handle this problem. I do believe however, that it is obviously a problem. Many countries have been adversely affected by it. Countries near the Black Sea have been affected by the Atlantic comb jelly which has eliminated the zooplankton and which has exhausted the regions anchovy fishery. Shellfish in Tasmania have also been wiped out by North Pacific sea stars and closer to home, fisheries in Oregon and Washington are vulnerable to purple varnish clams and the green crab.<p> I've lived on a lake in Minnesota my whole life and even in Minnesota the problem of invasive species (specifically invastive plants) is a huge issue. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, zebra mussels and Eurasian watermilfoil hitch on boats and trailers and travel from one lake to the next. To prevent this, there are signs on boat landings reminding people of the law which requires people to remove plants and animals from their boats and trailers. There are people on my lake that have been designated to go out once a month and check for milfoil. So far, so good....because they haven't found any yet.  This problem is definitely on a smaller scale than the ballast problem with huge ships in the oceans, but I think it's still comparable. <p> Truthfully, I think that invasive species are inevitable because we live in a global world, and in a global world there is trade. Global trade ultimately promotes invasive species. <p> So back to the regulation part (the part I'm not so familiar with). As far as regulations go, it is hard to make ballast regulations because it is time-consuming, expensive, and most ships aren't built to handle it. Ships can also get around regulations by declaring no ballast on board..and I'm sure that there are other loopholes. Plus, ships were not engineered to remove 100% of their ballasts. Regardless, I think that the goal should be zero discharge of invasive species. This sounds contradictory, but overtime regulation should drive technology until ship design and technology are able to reach zero, or close to it. This is a goal that will not be achieved over night, but over time.
