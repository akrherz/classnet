===message:coming with a little knowledge on ships and sailing.  it would be very difficult to "invent a way" so that  the ships would not have to take on water on the return trip.  it is a matter of balance.  the weight is necessary to stabilize the ship in rough waters.  if water were not taken on then what would?  also, concocting trade exchanges that would import/export at the same time to continuously maintain weight is an ingenious idea.  unfortunately, you are talking about people.  this would be chaotic.
