===message:<p>Your points are very well taken. On a day to day basis most of us must think mainly about the <b>short term </b> because this is where our urgent and immediate life necessities and pleasures take place. If we were to think about the long term consequences we would worry alot so maybe it is safter to be ignorant (uninformed)<br>However, the integrity of the sea shore and other coastal areas is very important to the health and sustainability of many things we value in America and the world so instead of ignorance we should understand how to preserve these systems.
