===message:I have to agree with Victor on this one.  Much of what we depend upon for life is produced either directly or indirectly by our oceans.<br><br>

First off, most of our oxygen supply is produced by the algae that grows on the surface of the water.  That same algae feeds the creatures of the ocean that eventually become our food.<br><br>

Also, that same water in the ocean gets soaked up into storms which brings rain to the inland areas, filling our natural water resources and feeding the crops we eat.<br><br>

Face it, we rely on the ocean, and it's well-being is our well-being.
