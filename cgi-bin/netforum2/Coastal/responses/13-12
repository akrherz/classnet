===message:Policy that gets made to this effect will have great social and economic impact to a very large population.  As we have read in our books (and seen in the videos), the huge costal population boom means that more and more constituants live in these zones.  Making policy to limit building and perhaps even removing some development in these areas would be political suicide.<br><br>

Also, inline with these focuses, the financial loss from these high-traffic areas would hurt our economy, which is currently limping already.<br><br>

So, how do you fix it?  Apparently, we need a few political 'martyrs' to change that policy, and hope that the next generation of policy makers don't change them back to gain favor with the mob.
