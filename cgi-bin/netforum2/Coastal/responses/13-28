===message:It seems to me that we have developed technology a lot faster than we have developed the moral responsibilities and obligations that go along with these new technologies and the dangers that come with them.  In the fishing industry for example, we have come up with vessels and techniques of fishing that are simply too effective and the fish populations are being wiped out because of this.  And it is human designed chemicals that have been destroying the ozone layer and threatening the balance of our earth's climates.  It seems we are finally accepting that it is our doing, but we still have not stepped up to the responsibility to do something about it.  We know that agricultural run-off is reaching the Gulf of Mexico and suffocating different life forms there.  This is a drastic and desperate situation but we don't see anything drastic being done about it.  The truth is that we as humans are going to have to make sacrifices and change the life styles we have become comfortable with.  But these sacrifices seem very small and insignificant when faced with the other possibilities of seeing our environment and oceans being destroyed.
