===message:The problem of the Marshalls was one that I became aware of some years ago on an assignment. When I first got there (even though I had read all about it and could recite the statistics) I was stunned for days to realize that I could almost see the entire island of Majaro in on sweeping view. The whole place, all of it. From one side of the island to the other was 50 yards. I was told the highest point above sea level was 7 feet but it didn't look that high at high tide. I visited a monument to those lost in a "great wave" - probably a Tsunami. It washed right over the island taking everyone and everything with it. In a book written by a missionary is a description of surviving a hurricane. All of the tin roofs are taken off of the houses (at a 100 MPH they are deadly). People and pigs are tied into the trees. If your tree survives you probably will too. If your tree falls everyone goes with it.
This was all before the problem of global warming threatened rising sea levels. I don't think the world is ready to solve the problem of where to put these people. To scatter them is to destroy a culture and a language. But where in the tropical, oceanic world would any country give up land for them??

===message:What I've learned so far is that the issue of costal managment is a subject that clearly is not solved.  Many people have different views on this issue.  People are continually trying and inventing new things to which they believe will solve the problem of costal managment.  In turn what I've learned from the fact that people are struggling to find ways to work around nature is the fact that, in my opinion working around nature is never going to be solved.  I believe their are ways to enjoy nature without totally destroying the environment.  However when money is involved and people's selfish attitueds come into play, you know what the rest of the equation looks like.<p>This knowledge will contribute to my professional development because I realize people in alot of instances are out for thier own interests.  Sometimes that's not a bad idea however when it means that future generations aren't going to enjoy what they have destroyed, then I believe it becomes a problem that requires our attention.
