===message:While reading chapter 4 of Ocean's End about the Mississippi River and the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico I was struck by how everything is so connected.  I think it is fascinating and also scary that policies and actions up here in the middle of Iowa could have such an effect on the ocean.  One startling fact was the summer after the floods of ' 93, the dead zone doubled in size to 7,000 sq. miles.  I remember seeing all the damage that flood caused but I never would have imagined that it would also result in marine life being suffocated in the Gulf of Mexico!  It really makes you think that all of our actions do have results and consequences, even if they can't be seen immediately.  
There are many different reasons why we should be concerned about the ocean- the main one being that it is part of the ecosystem and connected to everything.  What goes into the Raccoon River goes into the Mississippi River and eventually into the Gulf of Mexico.  It is not somebody else's problem to deal with.  After reading about what goes into our drinking water here in Iowa, we should also be concerned for our own health.
