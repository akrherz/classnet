===message:  I have to agree with Erin to some extent.  The state and federal governments should intercede in cases of natural disaster as we support such disaster relief through our tax dollars(e.g.,FEMA etc.). However those individuals living in high risk areas should bear the burden of higher insurance premiums. Not government.
<br>
  Although all insured individuals bear some of the burden for people living in flood plains, tornado alley etc., I believe that more of the burden of flood insurance premiums be shifted to those individuals living in those areas. As our climate continues to change so will the frequency of flooding (e.g., 100, 500 year floods/hurricanes occuring every 5 or ten years). By shifting the responsibilities of higher premiums to individuals and businesses in flood prone/storm areas people will eventually leave these areas as they will not be able to fully insure their property.
