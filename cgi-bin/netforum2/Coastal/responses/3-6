===message:I absolutely agree with Joe. The people who are foolish enough to build dangerously close to the coast should bear the costs of high risk insurance. The argument presented in the online reading regarding health insurance is not persuasive. It seems somewhat logical that all of society should share the costs of health insurance, including those abnormally high costs to those who may be at high risk of cancer, heart disease, etc. For the most part, people with debiliating diseases do not choose to undertake this risk (perhaps with the exception of smokers and lung cancer). Foolish rich people who build on the coast choose to do do and therefore should bear much if not all of the costs of high risk insurance. For the small minority of poor people in the U.S. living in beachfront property, who perhaps can neither afford to move nor the expensive insurance, the government should assist with the costs of relocation.

===message:Whereas Florida may not be the "bread basket of the world" and thus seem less important to us, we need to remember that the state of Florida's economy is affected when "the foolish rich people's" hotels are wiped out.  The whole state benefits through tourism. Merchants, ect. will feel the pain if their hotels are wiped out and not rebuilt, the loss of places for tourists to go mean less tourism, less money flowing in. So looking at it that way, state aid for insurance must be avaiable (and maybe even national) if the owners can't afford it/ can't receive it to help these communities and the whole state have their econonomy remain stable after even a small natural disaster.

===message:I cannot imagine why someone would think that those people that either cannot afford or realize that it's too risky to live on the coast should end up taking on some of the costs associated with having people living in unstable areas on the coasts! If I am a home owner that lives in the interior of Florida, why should I have to pay for your insurance so you can live by the beach? More importantly, why would someone who is living in Wyoming or Nebraska pay for the costs associated with those living in affluent, high risk, beautiful areas along the coast? Granted there is a collective benefit for those that are around tourist areas in terms of an economic boost, but why not let those that use those high risk areas pay for the insurance themselves? There are many many ways one could do this too, e.g. a higher sales tax, much higher property taxes, hotel taxes, etc. <b><i>In short, let those who can afford to go to those areas and are receiving the benefit pay the cost!</b></i>

===message:It seems to me that the economy of the state of Florida as a whole would not be severely damaged to the brink of collapse if the homes and condos of the wealthy were mercifully knocked down by a cat 4 or 5 storm. I have no doubt that someone, somewhere, with money to spend would want to rebuild. Lets assume that a lesson has been learned and these former beachfront homes, condos, hotels, etc, are moved even a few miles inland. Construction jobs are created. Perhaps John Q. Public decides to spend his next vacation there in a newly cleared beach where he can now view beautiful expanses of ocean unencumbered by miles of concrete, glass, and steel. Perhaps more tourism dollars flow in. Maybe the people now living in a less risky area can now afford insurance. Sure, some people will come up with the short end of the stick, and the economy will undoubtedly suffer from any massive storm and its accompanying destruction, but I personally feel that resillient Florida would bounce back. Perhaps someone can fill in for me the holes in this line of thinking that I have undoubtedly missed.............

===message:I would have to agree with Megan and Joe.  I don't think it is fair for everyone living in a state to have to pay for the 10 percent living in a high risk area.  I think those ten percent need to pay.  They were the ones that chose to live there and they should consider that when choosing a location to live.  I'm sure a lot of people would like to live in a place so near to the ocean and with such a great view, but they don't because of the risks involved.  I also see Megan's point when she mentions that Florida would bounce back from a cat. 4 or even cat. 5 hurricane.  Florida is the huge tourist state it is because of its beauty and beaches.  If there were a hurricane that wiped out most of the buildings I think those wanting to enjoy the "buildingless" beaches would help boost Florida's economy once again.  And like Megan said, with that boost those who want to live near the beaches may be able to afford it and then can pay for their own insurance and deal with the risks involved.  Once again coming to the point that it is not everyone in the state's responsibility to have to pay for the few who are going to enjoy the benefits of living on beach from property.

===message:I disagree that the costal people should be held financially responsible for their property in the face of natural disaster such as hurricanes.  Every part of our nation and world has its own risks.  California - earthquakes, Hawaii and the pacific northwest - volcanoes, Iowa - e floods from the Mississippi.  The call to make these people’s property and investments in the tragedy prone areas uninsurable has been heard every time a major problem occurs.  Those that don’t live there claim, why should I pay for those fools properties?  They should know better then to build by the ocean.  Later a volcano runs a river of lava through their living room and the guy on the coast says why should I pay for his burnt out forest home.  He should know better then to build on a volcano.  My point is the earth is dangerous and risk is present in all places.  Insurance is a method to spread that risk among many people to protect the people who lose it all.   When certain areas are singled out because of their extreme risk, such is the case for the coast of Florida, state or federal programs must take that burden on to artificially spread the risk out to the entire nation or state.  While this seems wrong, it actually works under the same principle all insurance works, only it is not voluntary because the free market fails us in this important matter.  People with health problems in the state of Iowa are covered by a similar program run by our state.  If you are uninsurable in the state of Iowa you have the right to purchase insurance at a reasonable rate from any insurance company who sells in the state but these policies are backed up by the state of Iowa and a special fund.  This insurance has limits to its premium charge to a certain percentage of standard rates in Iowa.  It would be easy to say to these people that we know will have claims that they are responsible for their own health care.  Why should the healthy people pay for the critically ill which will be a constant drain on the healthy people, and that is exactly what the insurance companies act on when given the chance to drop them from their policies.   The coast is no different and needs to be treated with the same care and understanding.

===message:Jason makes some excellent points, but in my opinion health insurance and hurricane inurance are not comparable. I would venture a guess that most people do not willingly choose diabetes, cancer, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, poorly functioning kidneys or tumors. Some people are genetically predisposed to certain conditions or are inexplicably affected by health troubles. Surely people living in high risk coastal areas are not oblivious to the fact that there is an enormous ocean looming nearby. Surely it is a somewhat informed decision and acknowledgement of risk to live along the coastline. Jason made me stop and think for a minute when he pointed out that all areas of this earth present their own dangers. I would not advocate abandoning the four corners of the earth for central Iowa. However, there are locales that are undeniably at a higher risk of catastrophe. People who constantly rebuild in flood plains or along fault lines or near volcanoes are no different and no less responsible for shouldering their own costs and risks than those who choose to live in high risk coastal areas. Of course this is America and people are relatively free to live where they choose. But I dont expect a Floridian to pay for my flood insurance any more than I would pay for his/her hurricane insurance.

===message:I agree that those who build homes on high risk property need to take responsibility for it.  How about businesses though?  What if a state's economic hub was in that area - like farms in floodplains or hotels & tourist attractions on high risk coastal areas?  Many nation states in Asia have their major cities along coast lines which may be create a vulnerability to areas of business/economic dependence.  Also, many of these states have placed their agricultural areas in high risk areas as can be seen with the current flooding in China which will have devastating effects on eastern China's future.
Also, with the court case which the article spoke of, private insurance can be turned down in turn for the public insurance, this completely gives anyone the opportunity to take advantage of this insurance/money that is available rather than use it because it is truly needed to protect a property/business that had existed before the area was designated high risk.
