===message:Interesting and Oregon is wonderful because they want to try and keep it sustainable and "green" - so get your hiking boots broken in! Diving up there is neat (some awsome and big cold water creatures including octopus- they are sweetand don't bite!) but you want to learn with a dry suit - the water is chilly. Ocean kyaking is big and lots of fun.
