===message:I think that global warming is very real and a subject that needs to be dealt with.  I understand that there is some disagreement of whether it is being caused by humans or could possibly be a natural short term trend that won't be a problem in the long run.  I think that there is more than enough evidence that human activities are conttributing or causing this warming trend (which has been highly accelerated recently).  Like discussed in Ocean's End, there are a lot of topics that we are not completely 100% sure on but we still need to act with common sense and do something about it- because, if we don't the possiblilites are horriffic.  It is definitely a global issue and the large industrial countries that are causing most of the damage need to step up and do something about it.  How frustrated nations like the Marshall Islands must be to see these powerful nations dragging their heels while the Marshallese can't do anything about it but they certainly have the most to lose.  The Kyoto Treaty seems like a step in the right direction even if it does not cut the emissions by enough.  I do not understand the reasoning behind drawing out of the treaty- and I think a lot of other nations didn't understand or appreciate that move either.
