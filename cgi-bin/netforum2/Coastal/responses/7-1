===message:Hi, my name is Kate Bezdicek. I am 21 years old and will be graduating from ISU May 2003. I can't wait!I currently have a major in Spanish and before next May, I will be completing two more majors in Marketing and International Business. I was born and raised on a lake in Minnesota and have done a bit of traveling ever since I was a little girl. I love the water..lake, ocean, river..whatever. :)  I am taking two online classes this summer and I have an internship as a marketing assistant at a Minneapolis bank as well. I spend any and all of my spare time on the water. My brother and I teach kids how to sail 420's at a local yacht club and on weekends I also do a lot of sailing on our catamaran..I sail in regattas about once a month.  I'm looking forward to a few vacations this summer..I'm going to Long Boat Key in 3 weeks and then early August, will be sailing  up the East Coast for a week with my family.
Hope everyone has a wonderful summer and nice meeting you all.

===message:<br> it's interesting how many people saw and like Jaws... and also how it has scared off so many people from swimming! I was on a Manatee dive and one of the women freaked out and started screaming and we had to get her out of the water because she remembered Jaws!!!
