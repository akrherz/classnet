===message:We are presented with a lose-lose situation.  In the past, we, as the American people, have gone back on our word, lied, cheated, and stolen to gain ground and valuable resources from those who had them through these 'treaties.'<br><br>
Again, we have the opertunity to go back on our word or to remain honest and uphold these bargins.  On the other hand, we are committed to preserving the life that exists on this plantet, trying to prevent extinction of yet another species.<br><br>
Unfortunately, I have to go with my first option.  Although that treaty was made in good faith, we could not forsee the eventual extinction of a species of whale.  As much as it pains me to support this, I believe it is more important to preserve a near extinct species than to hold to an old treaty made more than 100 years ago.
