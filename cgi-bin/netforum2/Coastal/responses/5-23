While it is easy to say no altogether to coastal contruction it is important to note that as a governor a person must consider all the stakeholders and facts.

The design, implementation, and evaluation of coastal policy can be very complex, time consuming and expensive.  Given the number of stakeholders and interests involved effective policy concerning coastal issues is vital.  Many factors relating to coastal construction must be considered prior to policy development.
<p>
If I had the authority to develop effective coastal construction policy I would first want to establish if current policies and laws, relating to coastal construction, are effective for those areas being targeted for policy revision. What is the reason for the new policy/revision? Whom does it serve?  Who are the stakeholders?  What are our desired goals?  Is there a problem in the first place?  These basic questions should be answered before designing policy.  Surely all voices should be heard.  Impact statements must be produced and presented for public and private interests and be made available to all parties requesting this information.  Given the financial resources, I would also acquire input from various internal and external consultants, professionals and government bodies.  Ideally, these policy revisions should also take into consideration the area’s history and cultural traditions if applicable.

As a leader my role is to act as a representative for all people involved.  Even so, I believe that some of my personal ideas might be effective for the common good. I would like to promote some ideas of my own. Personally, I would try to limit construction on the coast as well as establishing guidelines for the type construction and how far from the coast such structures should be built.  Taxes should be levied accordingly with added tax dollars allocated to coastal maintenance in my area.  Personally I would like to see smaller dwellings built to higher construction standards and proof of life and property insurance for individuals in areas where dwellings are permitted.  I would also like to see more access for the public along the coast and limited liability for property owners whose beaches would be open to the public.  I would also like to see more efforts made by organizations to acquire coastal property with the intention that such property will not be developed. Existing structures might need to be maintained to meet the needs of the local constituents.
