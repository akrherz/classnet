===message:I also agree that population growth and development near coasts is a serious coastal zone problem. According to what I have read so far, common coastal problems include: erosion, pollution, and habitat degradation/loss of biodiversity. All of which I think are results of overpopulated coasts. As the book points out, extensive development near coasts leads to coastal erosion, and coastal erosion leads to loss of land. Ninety percent of the coast is eroding and extensive development near coasts cannot coexist with an eroding beach. Visiting US and world coasts, it is evident that everyone is moving to the coast. Coasts are becoming crowded with development. Beaches are growing smaller and smaller and the water is becoming more polluted.
