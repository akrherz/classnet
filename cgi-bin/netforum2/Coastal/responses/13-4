===message:I agree with Joe.  As was stated in lecture #1 there is not only the interior regional area but also the exterior regional area.  One example that can be seen of how one nations coastal policy is affected by another can be seen here http://www.sciencenews.org/20010421/fob3.asp where Sid Perkins discusses the development of the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze River in China and it's affects on Japan in terms of warming due to lowered water level.  This problem created for Japan is not only an interior regional problem but also an exterior one considering that dealing with China on environmental issues will prove to be difficult for Japan in the future.  Based on the different governmental structures priorities and China's past actions,  China will most likely this off shrug off and will not soon take responsibility for considering the large amount of money and energy put into this project and then if it becomes a problem that can in no way be ignored will claim ignorance. Therefore, I agree with Joe that our biggest problem will be having nations realize, despite differences, that we all need to work together and actually following through... just one more tie into globalization.
