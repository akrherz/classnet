===message:even though economic growth, in a sense may be slowing, this does not mean that money has become any more invaluable.  on the other hand, money seems more important now than during the industrial revolution.  Because of this, i dont think companies are going to put down their drills and have a meeting with the nature conservency.  their top priority will be cost efficiency, not saving the oceans (although they might make some small change in their policy and blow it up like they are saving the world).   i mean, we are americans
