===message:Unfortunatly, most of us don't have the power to "control" the government and the laws they allow.  For the most part, the government tries to please everyone, but if some rich man wants something done with something around his/her house, they have the money to "contribute" to a government official, at least just enough to keep the house on the beach.  I wish I had more to contribute, but I'm sure that if I went through everyone else's postings, they would have the same ideas that I could come up with.
