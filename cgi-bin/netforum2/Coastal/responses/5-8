===message:Instead of just taxing the piss out of those who choose to build in these high-risk areas, I offer an additional solution.  A funds-matching program for beach restoration.  For every $1 paid to the local government for taxes in this area, have businesses offer up an additional $1 to maintain and restore the beaches in the areas they dwell in.  This way, they participate by saving the local environment, as well as contribute to the state government for state-wide development.  Also, as Megan said, the additional charge for building there would be an added deterant for newcomers.

===message:I think one way to effectively discourage deveopment on the coast would be to make the developers pay into a fund that would be used to counter the harmful effects caused by the development.  Hopefully this would make the area less attractive to developers, especially if they were required to pay a significant amount.  These developers seem only able to think short-term, they aren't considering the likeliness of problems from storms and erosion and are certainly not considering the harm being done to the beaches themselves.  So it seems hitting them with a harsh monetary fine would be something they would be forced to pay attention to.
Also putting restrictions on building and especially re-building after destruction seems very reasonable to me, but after reading "Against the Tide" it seems that is easier said than done.  Not being able to get insurance also sounds like a very good deterent but if people just rely on the federal government to step in with aid, and the government does this every time, then this won't be very effective either.  I definietly think that these people should not be helped with finding insurance or affordable insurance because they need to be held responsible for the risks and irresponsibility of ignoring what all the research and science is telling us.

===message:Good idea - businesses definitely need to share the costs of beach nourishment and other projects to benefit the whole state. A lot of good could be done with revenues collected from any kind of program like this.
