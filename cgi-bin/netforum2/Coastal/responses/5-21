===message:I agree with this statement because some of these problems are never going to go away.  People with money are always going to put up the best condo or beach house they can wether they no anything about coastal policys or not.  I think places that are already beach towns should remain, but somehow try to have some kind of seminar of the upkeep of the beach and the coastal shore, and also the dangers involved in living in these areas such as loosing your home to natural disasters.  On the other hand beaches that are not developed there would be a law made, to not allow construction to take place.  We need to preserve as much as we can.  As I stated earlier beach towns are always going to be around so lets preserve and take care of what has not been constructed.

===message:If I was governor of a costal state the first thing I would stress would be education of law makers, the public and property owners.  If you noticed the chapter in "Against The Tide" was called "Constituency of Ignorance".  People are ignorant of the effects of construction on the beaches which result in seawalls, rip-rap, groins, ect.  I realize that many want to stay ingnorant of the fact that the beaches are deminishing.  In this case I would make people resposible for their own property.  If they are going to diregard the evidence that unnatural barriers will speed up the erosion problem then let them worry about the after effect when their property is destroyed.<p> I think one thing I would try to encourage if I was governor would be to treat the beach like a national park.  Meaning that people could come and enjoy the beach but development could not take place in the disignated areas.  This would insure the natural cycle of the beach.
