===message:Insurance is (pardon my french) a bitch.  Whenever something happens on the coast, it affects everyone and everything on the coast.  If someone uses drenches to provide more sand to their part of the beach, another part of the beach loses sand and thus causes more damage to that part of the beach, causing insurance for everyone to go up, even the people with the new, more beach.
