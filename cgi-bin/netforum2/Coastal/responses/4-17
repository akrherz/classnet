===message:I was in full agreement with you on a few points until you mentioned no special rights should be given to minorities.  The whale is in danger, not from the Indians, but from the special rights given to non-minorities.  

Equal treatment under the law may be working for you, but it isn't for others in this world.

===message:I have to agree with Brant Allen on this issue. It is true that American Indians have certain "Sovereign Rights" granted to them by treaties with the American Government. I also agree that some Indians feel that hunting whales is an important spiritual issue.  Being sensitive to the needs of other cultures is a good thing but in the case of hunting an endangered species, I have to take exception. To put it simply, I do not feel that one group's tradition  should jeopardize the future of an already endangered species. 
<p>
Upon further reflection I wonder about the validity of the Makahs claims.  Why is this such an issue now?  Even some tribal members and leaders question the spiritual basis of this tradition within their own society.

I agree that Indians have rights and spiritual needs but what about the rights and spiritual needs of other groups and individuals who feel that hunting an endangered species shouldn't be further threatened by what some groups and individuals consider an antiquated tradition.

===message:i very much agree with Brant Allen and the previous reply.  It was a terriable thing how we treated the indians in the past, but along with it came great progress, and we can not forever give them special rights for what happened so long ago. I am not actually opposed completely of giving minorities special rights, but when it has potential to hurt an entire species, that is where the line must be drawn.  You do have to question the Makah true respect of nature when they want to hunt a speices that is endangered.  As far as their children losing their way, better parenting, ect. would be the first thing to look at not a whale hunt.  As time passes all traditions become altered in some way, i'm sure there would be a way to carry on their spritual connection and identity non-violently and without the killing of any animals.  If the tribes survival depended on this tradition, I would look differntly on the issue, but as stated they aren't dependant on the whale meat.

===subject:My point

===message:While I can see your point, I have to disagree. I believe in the constitution, which states that no person shall be discriminated against on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion ect... By giving certain groups SPECIAL privileges on the basis of the above, you are violating that citation. Giving groups special treatment always ends in some form of discrimination. That's while I feel that EQUAL treatment under the law is the only way to go about enforcement. No group deserves any special privileges, all groups deserve equal opportunities.

===message:After reading the comments and replies, I reviewed the Makah material again.  I cannot see where the Great Gray Whale is listed or indicated as an endangered species.  What I do read, is a paragraph stating the "population of gray whales along the West Coast has recovered sufficiently."  It also states, "That quest [the Makah whale harvest] is supported by the U.S. Government and by the Treaty of Neah Bay."  This treaty being the only U.S. treaty that allows a whaling provision and only to one tribe, the Makah.  So, in essence by the U.S. supporting their rights to hunt the gray whale, I have to trust and assume the gray whale population can withstand the proposed harvest.  If the U.S. Government had statistics showing this whale to be an endangered species, government support simply would not be there.  When I read comments such as "Our Society", "Equal treatment under the law", "Keeps environmentalists happy", "Better parenting (???)", it just makes me stop to think if "we" have the right to determine the answers to these kinds of questions for others.  We have the innate right to decide what is best for ourselves personally, but are we too judge what is right and proper for other people or cultures?  Does the Makah see themselves as part of "Our Society?"  Does U.S. law supercede Makah law?  Should all world communities concede to U.S. law?  What does the happiness of environmentalists have to do with anything?  By the way, I consider myself a strong advocate for many environmental causes!  How did the rights to hunt get to parenting?  Do we really want governments telling us how to raise our children now?  Where does U.S. influence stop?  Why is our way the right way...for everyone else?  From the information we were given on this topic, I for one congratulate the Makah people.  When the population of Great Gray Whales deteriorated from overharvest [by people other than themselves] they voluntarily discontinued their own harvest to help the resource recover.  Likely knowing full-well even if they continued their hunt, it would not have had an impact on the overall whale population.  Credit should be given where it is due.  As within all cultures or societies, there are those who will be at opposing ends of an issue, and this is what the article implies within the Makah tribe.  The article simply says, "Even a few tribal members have complained...", it in no way applies this is a majority opinion of the tribe, but the opposite.  Sometimes, it is human nature to focus on what we want to believe instead of what the facts are especially if someone else has the same point of view because we are emotional beings.  Out of all this, and for the record, I do not condone the killing of any whale, by anyone, anywhere, for any reason, healthy population or not; but what I do respect and appreciate is that the Makah have exhibited true concern for the whale by discontinuing their harvest when the species needed to be left alone, they are not asking for or attempting something beyond what has always been a given in their culture, and it has the support of a co-government (the U.S.) and their tribal leaders.  The only troubling issue I saw, and thought someone would raise as a motive to disagree with this harvest, was in the very last sentence of the article.  "...bringing it back to our people to be distributed as food and exercising our treaty right."  The words treaty right as a last note, stuck in my mind.  This leads me to a, hmmmm moment, are they truly doing it as part of their cultural heritage (which I support) or is this possibly their way of expressing "we have this right" and we "intend to show you" we have this right.  If the latter, that is troubling for me.  I would continue to support their right to be autonomous as long as a resource's existence is not threatened, but in fairness to my own conscience, if they are doing this simply to prove they have a right then my support would be turned down several notches.  But,there is not enough information to personally make this judgment for myself either.  Interesting topic and opinions...smile.  Capt. Dave
