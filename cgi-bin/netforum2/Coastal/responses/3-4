===message:I thought I knew the anwser to this question until it was compared to farm releif.  On one hand the the people who build in coastal areas know the risks and are the one's reaping the benefits, so they should take the loses on their own also.  But we all benefit from coastal economy in one way or another, and it could eventually hit us here at home if they are suffering there.  Hurt economy in one area of Florida is going to affect the rest of Florida, and the whole state should prepare for it, looking at it as not just protecting 10% of the people living on the coast- but the whole state.  There are other state and national programs for people who are in financial trouble (welfare, unemployment), we all pay taxes for these programs (liking it or not)so why wouldn't the same hold true here. Besides feeling sorry for the for the people who lost their homes and business we (the government) should provide some sort of relief to get them back up and running- to protect the overall economy.  I really think that if people can get private policies they should be kicked off of the state's.  If they can't afford the higher rates private companies offer...move off the coast.  But for those that have no other options FWUA is great.  The subsidized insurance program, I feel is a good start to solving the problem as long as the people in low-risk areas are min charged with almost all the money coming from those in high to moderate risk areas.

===message:Just something to share..I found this on the headline of CNN.com this morning. I found it interesting because it addresses exactly what we are studying and gives some really relevant examples. Sorry, I counldn't find a way to directly link the site.

<P>
I am also not exactly sure exactly where I stand but after reading our material, I do have some opinions. Insurance is seen as a major means of coping with climatic hazards. I think that those who build on the coast, with all the risks that are implied, should bear the cost of insurance. One interesting thing to remember in all of this (globally speaking)is that insurance is widely available only in developed countries. What do the people do in the coastal countries where insurance isn't so widely available? <P> The people that own the property should pay for their own insurance, but some insurance companies will not provide insurance for risky property.  In this case, I think that in a state (like Florida), the economic value from the industry is too great to be ignored and the state should underwrite the risks and offer insurance by creating a property-insurance pool to provide policies for risky properties with reasonable premiums for property owners <P> However, thinking about this, doesn't this type of aid, (like federal goverment providing flood damage etc.) make insurance artifically afforable and further encourages more coastal development(which many of us have said is one of the biggest coastal problems)? Anyone would build on the coast if they could. I would. This kind of thinking means more government pay-outs. It seems like a nasty cycle. 
A lot of thoughts, but I think that I'm still back to my first thought, property owners should bear the costs of insurance.
