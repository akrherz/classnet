===message:I agree with Lisa that we would all benefit from cutting government subsidies, except for large corporations.  Unfortunately, these are the people with money and they're going to have a lot of say in what we do in the future.  What we need to focus on is a way to implement coastal policies and do it in a way to open people's eyes.  The truth of the matter is we're selfish and money makes the world turn.  So if ever there's a choice between our earth and making money, the vote will be for the green stuff and I don't mean trees.  I think the research we're doing now is great, but somehow we need to show the world that if we don't do something now we're going to be in big trouble in the future.  We need to hit the ones with power and show them that unless these policies are formed their children may not be as well off as them.  I guess what I'm saying is that something definitely needs to be done.  But in order to get it done we need to hit the powerful people where it hurts.  They aren't going to care about the beaches and life in the oceans.  However, they will care that one day their livelihoods will be threatened (beach resorts, hotels, fishing industries, shipping companies, etc...).  So when we're showing them the problem, let's include them in the picture and see if that doesn't have an impact on their decisions.
