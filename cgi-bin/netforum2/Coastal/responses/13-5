===message:I belive that their are implications and consequences of reversing policy that was presented in the book.  Just from an economic stand point eliminating things such as golf courses would have an impact on somebody who could have the potential to get rich off it.  However should we really care about this?  It might be mean to say but "I dont".  Colin Woodard points out that gulf courses are one major pollutant because of the chemical runoff.  I believe that public attitude will need to change before certain sound policies can be implemented.  I belive the sad fact is that we are going to have to experience something devistating before change will be brought about. Some devestating things have happend already such as the fishing industry exploting the ocean, however something is going to have to happen that directly effects a number of people before they start to take action.
