===message:although i think that anyone who hunts should try running from a shotgun that is aimed at YOU... i do agree with your suggestion.  if we can do it then why cant they?  in fact, the indian tribes put to use ALL of the animal while "we" cook up the good stuff (or maybe stuff the poor thing as a trophy) and toss the rest to the dogs.  on a side note,  it would be interesting to see how close to extinction the whales actually are.
