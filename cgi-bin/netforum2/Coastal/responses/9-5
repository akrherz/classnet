I agree that oceans are important. I would like to approach this topic by discussing it within the context of five recognized institutions including, economic, education, government, family and religious.  
<p>
Economically speaking, oceans provide resources. The oceans and coasts provide economic opportunities such as fishing, recreation, construction, tourism and shipping industries.  These economic industries in turn support a strong government.  The oceans provide a means of transportation for a government allowing it to extend its influence world-wide (e.g., U.S. sending warships to the Mediterranean to destroy our enemies). The vast differences between shores offers a natural defense against invasion by a hostile country.  Families rely upon the ocean as a means of support and enjoyment.  Whole generations of families and communities have their identities tied to the ocean and coastal areas.  These families rely upon ocean and coastal areas for their livelihood (e.g., maritime industries such as fishing). Educationally speaking, oceans provide a living laboratory with research opportunities for students of many disciplines.  The ocean also provides a means to challenge and educate people who wish to learn about themselves as the venture out on and below its surface.  On a religious note the ocean provides some individuals a spiritual outlet.  The ocean calls out and draws some people to its shore with its siren call as if it is calling you home.  The sounds of the sea often have a peaceful effect on a troubled individuals spirit that no ordinary balm can cure. It is in fact the wellspring from which all life sprang.

Oh! It also provides about 90% of our breathable oxygen so it's not a good thing to kill it off!
