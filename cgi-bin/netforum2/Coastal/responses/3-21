===message:I agree that not all should be taxed for the property damage incurred by coastal storms. Those owning beach front property more than likely have the money to protect their extremely expensive property. It is unfair to tax an entire population for the risks taken by a select few, even if their risk provides jobs and tourists booms for the surrounding economy. Realistically though, how is a city or region supposed to raise money for storm damage? Who will voluntarily give money to a foundation when they might not even see how the effects of coastal problems reach them?
