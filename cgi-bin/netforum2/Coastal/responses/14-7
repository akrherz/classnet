Like Dave I?ve had the opportunity to visit many beaches.  Some of these included the areas of Galveston, San Diego, Pensacola and Daytona.  The one experience I would like to share with you occurred at New Smyrna Beach. Florida in 1997.

I had the opportunity to visit this beach for the first time in the early 70?s. I lived in Orlando at this time but I spent almost every weekend on this beach.  It was white sand and was located in a protected wildlife area so little development occurred.  My family and I moved back to Iowa but I always wanted to return. I did in Sept. 1997.

It was the way I had left it.  Except for the sharks.  On the second day of my visit I had waded out into the surf at chest level when I was knocked off my feet by something large and rough.  As started to back out of the surf I observed a single fin break the surface of the water.  Surprisingly, I went back into the water later.  The next day I charted a Cessna flight to observe the beach from the air.  Right off the point from the beach where I was bumped, and beyond the surf zone, the pilot and I spotted a school of bull sharks. The pilot believed them to be eight footers.  This experience in no way detracted from my love of the beach.  To this day I feel safer in the surf than working with livestock in a safe Iowa pasture.

===message:During the summer of 2000 I took a friend on a helicopter tour along the beachfront from Ft. Lauderdale south to Miami and back.  From five hundred feet in the air, quite a scene unfolded below.  It was easy to watch the food chain in action.  On the beach in chairs and on towels were the sunbathers.  Next were folks dabbling their toes at the water's edge.  Then you had people who were wading out, up to their chest, and occasionally swimming around.  There was a gap from these people out maybe another thirty yards until the surf broke over the last underwater bar, or underwater rock deposits and old reef remains, which were clearly visible in the gin clear water.  Above this structure, not fifty to seventy-five yards from shore were the surfers on their boards, underneath them were huge schools of baitfish, and the ever present barracuda hovering over and on the outside, or Gulf Stream side, of the rocks.  Just out from the line of surfers, baitfish, and barracuda, maybe another thirty yards, was the line of sharks.  The sharks were solitary and could be seen every one hundred yards or so, slowly drifting north in the current parallel to the beachfront just outside the baitfish, keeping them pinned against the dead reefline.  Sharks love to eat barracuda.  Barracuda love to eat the cigar minnows, menhaden, sardine, and goggle-eye baitfish.  Interestingly enough, just another one hundred yards out from the sharks were the dive boats placing recreational divers in the water for their drift dives down a deeper reef line.  This scene was continual for every mile we flew down the beach.  I had to wonder what these people would do if they only knew how close they were to these sharks.  We estimated the average shark to be eight feet plus, with several we felt were easily over twelve.  There was no shortage of sharks on this day!  And the people in the water had "the sharks surrounded!"  The pilots told us on many flights they could see sharks just feet away from the surfers and following the divers!  I must also add we conservatively saw twenty manta rays on that flight too.  Big, beautiful, and even graceful appearing from the air.  I've yet to encounter one on a dive, but I know they are off the east coast of Florida in the summertime in great numbers and will meet up with one someday!  Capt. Dave
