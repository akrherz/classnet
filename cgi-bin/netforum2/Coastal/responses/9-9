===message:We should be intrested in the quality of water, temperature and life in the ocean's because we depend on the ocean for our survival.  People need to realize that just because we dont drink the ocean's water we still depend on it.  This may mean some depend on the ocean for their very lively hood.  In other words they catch and sell fish to consumers.  However if pollution continues at the rate currently who knows what could happen to the ocean's ecosystem.  For example if we end up killing a certain species off, another species may rely on, a chain reaction could occur. This would result in the entire ecosystem suffering tremendous consequences.  Many species could be lost and are currently lost because of this factor. <p>We also need the ocean just for the mere fact that it's a magnificent thing.  Can people possibly think of life without the ocean and all the benefits it provides.  I know that I certainly cant.
