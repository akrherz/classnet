This will be short. The future is bleak.  If current trends continue and elitist's sense of entitlement doesn't change all the policy in the world won?t stop the continuing environmental degradation.  Unless a global coordinated effort is implemented the best we can hope for is a slowing in the rate of environmental degradation. This might change if a catastrophe occurs that eliminates our population on a global scale (e.g., flu epidemic).  If this would occur we might have a chance to control population and essentially start over.

===message:I agree with this discusion topic that population is getting out of control and there isn't much that we can do about it.  The more the population rises the more our land is going to be polluted and misued.  I also agree that there needs to be a broad educational basis for land degradation and the importance of the land and the coastal zones.  The more educated that we are on this topic the better the management will be towards preserving coastal zones.  That is a large statement and it's not going to happen with just a few students, but the more we are educated and informed the better things will be.  Along the ocean various hotels, golf courses, and other chains are being built at a fast rate.  According to the book runoff from the golf courses into the ocean is one of the worst cases of pollution.  This just goes to show that if someone can make money on something that is built along side an amazing part of the country (the ocean) people will do just about anything to make money with no consideration of the coastal zones.  That is probably farthest from their minds.  We need to preserve the coastal areas as much as possible and try to limit the construction along the coast.

===message:Well boss, I misread the question in my first discussion and need to answer it accordingly.  I think the issue isn't nation specific as the health of the open sea is critical to all nations.  Fish stocks are migratory in nature, they have one goal in mind, and that is to eat.  Wherever the baitfish go, the predator species follow.  King mackeral populations typically migrate each spring from below Key West to the upper Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana.  These same fish, in a different year, can decide to follow the east coast up to the Carolinas.  Once fall weather patterns return and water temps drop, the fish reverse the process and head back below Key West and at times, on into the Caribbean for the winter.  Individually tagged and released billfish have been caught off both the coast of Africa and America.  Thousands of miles of open ocean are their playground.  They know no boundaries.  I believe the first policy should be education.  People, regardless of their nationality, are economically motivated.  Educated people will try and make economically sound decisions.  People need to eat and it takes money to buy food.  Building and "progress" can continue to take place on mainland areas near the coast, but the barrier island and beachfront areas need serious protection and fast.  Unfortunately, it will take years to pass this education along, but if it can create an awareness in our youth that building on the beach is short-lived (in terms of three, four, five generations, knowing nature will eventually end it for us) or too expensive (no insurance subsidies) for economic success, building will slow.  People will not choose to intentionally lose money.  If we can muster the support for reclaiming these areas in the name of the common good, placing them in public trusts as they become available, we may be able to allow our coastlines to breath naturally again.  Obviously, I do not hold a utopian approach to this, and realistically tell myself we are many decades from this possibility even beginning, if ever; because if society chooses to live within inches of the ocean and on top of the last grain of sand, while they have the money to sustain the lifestyle, they will.  This is why it is so vital for "us" to fight fire with fire.  Money must be raised and it cannot always come from increased taxation, gosh, don't we have enough of that already.  It has to come from the hearts of those concerned and who are willing to sacrifice a little piece of their lifestyle and dreams to provide for future generations and life on this planet.  After this crash course in coastal decline, policy, and politics I remain firm in my belief we have to buy back our coastlines to protect them.  Legislation will only lead to more money coming from commercial interests to fight and litigate, tying up taxpayer money in defense of less than adequate laws which society will always find a way to circumvent anyway.  Money.  More money.  Let us not fight them and waste valuable tax dollars in courtrooms, but let us beat them at their own game.  Others do it raising money for causes, hey, let's get a U.S. Postal beach stamp!  Our new slogan is, "Buy Back America's Coastline" or "For only $.35 a day you can adopt this beach!" And we'll even include a picture and you may feel free to visit as often as you like!  It works for wetland restoration and preservation.  Money folks, it will take money.  All the talk in the world is fine and with a few more laws on the books, we'll support another couple of thousand attorneys (of which I will be one) and government employees, or we can dig in and act by returning an eye for an eye with destructive commercial greed.  I'll donate the first ten bucks!  Who do I send it to?  Smile...  Six years ago, as we recognized my wife was not going to overcome her second bout with cancer, we designed our wills so that whatever estate we might leave, would be put into the Hutchison Coastal Trust Fund with annual payments going to the State of Texas for the outright purchase and protection of coastal areas.  I have not adjusted this portion of my will since her death and have no intentions of ever eliminating this endowment.  The payments are perpetual and the trust will never cease to exist or be depleted.  Someday, since I am likely older than most of you, you, your children, or grandchildren, might just get to walk on a beach at sunset, or wade a marsh at sunrise in search of a redfish, and see the Dave and Louise Hutchison Coastal Unit #1, #2, or #333 signs as you enter the parking lot, an unpaved natural sand parking lot to boot.  I tend to think big, one or two preserved areas are not going to be enough for me, nor for Louise's memory, and since starting this course feel I may need to change my will to include the Louisiana marshes too.  I think it is the best legacy I can leave behind, for I grew up in and love coastal areas.  I am stressing personal responsibility.  This is MY personal coastal policy and I have implemented it.

===message:In agreement with earlier replies, I also believe that the global population is quite large and because of this the environment is taking a hit. However as we discussed in Dif Equ of a population application, the environment as a limit of the amount of life it can properly maintain. If the population is too great, then it will naturally diverge to the limit of the given environment. Same goes for if the population is under this environmental limit, the population will grow to meet this enviornmental capacity. I feel that no matter what the world will do this on its own, but in order to prevent catastrophies, or a doomsday event brought on by nature to reduce the population, someone should oversee that we do not abuse the environment. This somebody in my opinion should be an international government to put regulations in place and to start an educational process to inform everyone. Either us humans take care of the problem that we initiated, or nature will make sure its done herself.
