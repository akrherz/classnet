===message:but it IS known that CFC's break apart ozone and therefore allow more uv light to enter into the earth's atmosphere.  this is fact.  with that knowledge alone we can make an educated prediction that increased uv will cause damage to the earth's surface and those things living on it.  does that include golbal warming?  probably.  but there are additional factors too.  i would  be careful when saying that we cant really be sure what the consequences will be.  science may be relatively new but it can understand the old and make a pretty accurate prediction.
