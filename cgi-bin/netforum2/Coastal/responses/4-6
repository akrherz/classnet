===message:One can not base the approval argument for hunting on the fact that the population has gone up, rather one should look at what the population should be, or to what it was in 1855 when the treaty was signed. The fact that the great gray whale is an endangered species alone should block this.  And the argument that people are giving that it is a tradition is rather interesting.  There are many traditions that have been brought about in American Indian cultures. Although many are not protected by treaty, some(such as drug use and some coming of age rituals)are illegal.  When the treaty was signed in 1855 the whale population much different.  As cited on the WWF website: <pr> "Gray Whale - Lower Risk: conservation dependent. Of the original three populations, one is extinct in the North Atlantic, one is critically endangered in the western North Pacific, and one has recovered from very low levels in the eastern North Pacific. Main threats: as shallow water feeders, gray whales stay close to coasts and are vulnerable to human disturbance and entanglement in fishing nets. In particular, the critically endangered western population is threatened by intensive oil and gas development in their feeding grounds."  <pr>  As is apparent, the gray whale population isn't thriving (such as the ISU crow population), therefore we should not at this time allow the Makah to hunt these creatures.  Currently human intervention appears to be of major threat to the Gray Whale, so why increase that threat?
