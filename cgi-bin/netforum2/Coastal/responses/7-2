===message:Yes sir, I agree, it has been a wonderful life and I consider myself fortunate to now have a chance at a second one too!  Smile.  You got a deal boss, when I get through my law training, name the time and place, and I'll help anyway I can.  For those interested in Marine/Coastal law, you might pass along they should look at the University of Miami.  It's not cheap but they have the most comprehensive curriculum I've found yet at one campus.  Marine Insurance, Coastal Law, Law of the Sea, Marine Ecology and Law, Marine Pollution, Water Law, Admiralty, and Caribbean Law are all current offerings.  What I wouldn't give to have that legal background.  And they offer a Master of Law Degree in Coastal Law too.  Wow, would that be nice.  It is good to have a dream!  C'mon lady luck...smile.  Thanks again for the kind thoughts, it is very much appreciated that you took the time to read our bio's and comment.  Capt. Dave
