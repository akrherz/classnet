===message:Do you love the beach? Do you like to swim in clean water? Do you like to watch dolphins jump out of the water? I do!  For me, that is the first thing I thought of when asked why I should care about the oceans?  Water quality, temperature of water, and the life in the oceans are interdependent. 
They are all connected. The earth's resources depend heavily upon healthy oceans and healthy water. Water quality in a body of water definitely influences the way we use water (i.e. supplying drinking water, recreation, irrigating crops, watering stock, naviation/shipping, protectsino of aquatic ecosystems, wildlife habitats, scientific study and education, industrial uses). These reasons alone are enough to make me care about the oceans and the water quality.Water quality has effects on each of the things listed above and probably a lot more.  I believe that a healthy environment has two parts; is one in which the water quality supports a rich and varied community of organisms and protects public health. <p>  It is obvious that water quality is closely linked to the surrounding environment and land use. One of the most important measurements of water quality is water temperature. As we've learned, it has an effect on chemical, physical and biological processes. Water quality is therefore affected by water temperature. High water temperatures stress aquatic ecosystems and like many people are saying, when water temperature increases, sea level rises resulting in more potential problems. <p> If more than 85% live near the coasts and coasts and the number one vacation destinations, that is reason enough for me to believe that everyone ought to care about the oceans.
