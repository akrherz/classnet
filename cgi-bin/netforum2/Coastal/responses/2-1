===message:<p>Habitat degradation <b>is</b> the most important problem we face since the coastal zone is an ecosystem made up of complex and fairly delicate components. Moreover, it is a area affected by some of the more severe natural condictions (hurricanes and storm surges) which are best faced by the <b>natural</b> protective devices (dunes, barrier islands, and coastal vegetation habitats such as mangroves and marshes). So what do we do about all of this? (That's what the rest of this course is about!).
