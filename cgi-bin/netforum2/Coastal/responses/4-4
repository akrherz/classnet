===message:I also agree that the makah have their rights and rituals and a signed document from 1855, but if whales are endangered why go out and kill them because of a ritual.  I know these tribes will carry out anything in order to fullfill their rituals but they need to practice another one of their rituals.  It just doesn't make sense why you would kill a whale if they say it's close to extinction.  I know they said they were going to bring this whale back with powered boats but how would they get it on shore.  It sounds pretty hard to go miles into the ocean and shoot a whale with a shotgun.

===message:I agree that the native Americans have ceratin rights to their heritage and the land they inhabit. The U.S. was in a much more pristine environmental state before the Europeans "civilized" this area so obviously our practices are not the most environmentally sensitive. The methods the indians use to hunt the whale inhibit the excessive killing of these whales. Realistically a large number of whales cannot be killed and hauled to shore behind a hollowed out canoe.

===message:I do not think that the  Makah should be granted the right to hunt the whale. When the treaty was made..way back when in 1855..no one ever knew that the whales were going to be in  harm or that their population would be declining . You must move with the times and address the problems that are relevant. If the Makah have ignored this tradition and survived as a tribe the last couple hundred years, it's obviously not that important. I understand that a treaty was made but the treaty was not made in the event that whales were going to be in danger. Now that the the whales have recovered shouldn't matter.  Since the Makah abandoned their tradition to save their friend, the whale, then I think that the tribe should continue with this. What is really the point of hunting the whale? I don't think that killing  a whale is the only connection to the Makah's past. If no one else can do it, then they shouldn't either.
