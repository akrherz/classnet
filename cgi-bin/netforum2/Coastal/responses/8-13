I agree with Melissa that conditions in the Black Sea are occurring presently in the Gulf of Mexico. 
<p>
Environmental pressures and consequences that are currently observed in the Black Sea are now occurring along our coasts and the Gulf of Mexico.  The Gulf of Mexico is a sea and is currently experiencing a ?dead zone.?  While the current situation is not as profound in example as the Black Sea case study it is in fact occurring.  What worries me is that we may be destroying the Gulf at a slower pace and we will not know it until it is to late. 
<p>
The Black Sea is almost entirely landlocked and contaminants have little chance to be dispersed therefore the effects of the pollution are very noticeable.  The Gulf of Mexico on the other hand is somewhat open with tides, currents and storms circulating the water diluting the contaminants with little noticeable effect.  This might lead people to believe that the pollution at the current rate is acceptable with little incentive to curb the rates of contaminants flowing into the Gulf. Contaminants that settle and are incorporated into the floor and tie up with bottom sediments may eventually overload the system making the Gulf floor dead and unable to support other benthic organisms.  A collapse like this may be sudden and irreversible.
<p>
On the other hand if policies addressing the rate (and types) of contaminant discharge are revised and implemented our coastal area?s quality might be reclaimed at a faster rate and with fewer resources as opposed to other coastal areas (e.g., Black Sea). Unfortunately, I do not believe that this will happen. I don?t see the situation getting better. Given current population growth rates and the current rate of consumption and migration rates to the coasts I do not believe that policies, regulation and technology will offset the pressures we are exerting on our coasts. It all may be moot anyway as other countries, facing similar problems, may be unwilling or unable to cope with this problem. Worldwide pressures on coastal areas and oceans may cause widespread catastrophic ecological failures with a cascade effect that will eventually affect our systems as well.
