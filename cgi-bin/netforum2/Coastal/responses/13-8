===message:If you are going to be in the Port Elizabeth (South Africa) area you might check how they have regulated their coastline. I heard a paper at a conference on Dunes that showed how they were solving the problem by moving the hotels and such back behind the dunes and then building walkways, cabanas and low capital intensive structures for the tourists in the beach side. The upper floors of the hotel still looked out over the ocean but the dune fields were being left to do their job. This was about 15 years ago. I wonder if it is still this way or did pressure work here too. And, did it work. Are those hotels still in good shape and drawing a crowd?
