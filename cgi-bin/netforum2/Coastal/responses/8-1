===message:I think that this level of pollution along the coast could happen in the US, but we shouldn't let it happen. The crisis of the Black Sea shows that seas will not survive if we continue to regard them as botomless sewer pits in which we dump wastes of everything imaginable and then take food and other resources out of the them in huge quantities. This is evidence that everything has limits and an oceans carrying capacity can be pushed to the max.<p> The Black sea is analogous to what is happening to the ocean systems at large. All of these problems are piling up- oil spills, nutrient pollution, industrial discharges,  alien species, overfishing..and the list goes on. I think that the problem of the Black Sea can be attributed to the failure of governments to respond to this crisis in the beginning.In its case, to me, the problem is money because tons of people in those countries (Russia, Romania, Ukraine etc.) remain hungry, cold, homeless, wiped out by inflation and lack of jobs.  Although I do think that this sort of catastrophe is possible in the US, it doesn't have to be the case, and shouldn't. The government here is definitely capable of responding to this emerging problem. However, if the problem is ignored and nothing is done, a crisis like the Black Sea could take over. <p> For instance, the Mississippi River can be compared to the Danube River. The Danube empties out into the Black Sea just as the Mississippi empties out into the Gulf of Mexico. Not only do all of the petrochemical plants in New Orleans drain into the river and into the Gulf, but everything from 31 states and probably more. Both rivers drain at least half a continent.  <p> As a result, all of this "stuff" ( nitrates from fertilizers, sewage, chemicals etc.) is dumped into the Gulf.  There are large amounts of nitrates from the soil in both the Danube and the Mississippi that contribute to the havoc in the seas.  I definitely see this situation as a potentially dangerous one, leading into something like the Black Sea crisis. This is evidenced even today by the Dead Zone off the coast in the Gulf. It's an oxygen-less area of water and is really just like a seasonal version of the long-term condition of the Black Sea.<p> Oceans are finite and destructable. We must begin to control the pollution of the rivers and stop neglecting the seas.

===message:Yes I think that it is a very real possibility that we could see the same destruction of eco-systems that happened with the Black Sea and the rivers that run into it.  We also have chemical run-off, dumping of waste, oil spills, etc.  What happened with the Black Sea shows that these human activities WILL have effects, it is just a matter of time.  Hopefully we can stop the most harmful of our activities before we see such devastating effects and also have our beaches closed to people because of health risks and see the populations of marine life being wiped out.  It seems very tragic and ironic that people cannot have enough foresight to take action BEFORE we start seeing such drastic results.  Now it seems one of the only options in the Black Sea is to introduce more alien life- which indeed seems very risky.
