===message:moving construction inland would help with erosion.  however, who the hell is going to rent a room at a resort where you have to walk three miles to get to the beach.  your state is going to lose millions in tourism.  any other ideas?  what about virtual reality?  i bet we can simulate an ocean front view with all the video features available.  and artificial beach "smell" and one of those ocean sounds cd.  perfect
