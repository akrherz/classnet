Even if the world is naturally warming, human existence depends on a certain temperature range.  Unlike the dinosaurs, we are not temperature dependent for the determination of the sex of our offspring, but overall, it is obvious that the raising of temperatures will have deleterious effects on our everyday activities.  Therefore, I profess that the benefits of acting to stop any anthropogenic causes of global warming are doubly in our benefit.  Whatever we can do to lessen the detrimental effects of global warming should lessen the losses felt by rising sea levels, crop losses, etc.
 
While I recognize the ebb and flow involved in the climate of this planet, we should so everything in our power to encourage a favorable homeostasis because we’ve apparently already ruined the oceans and I’m not too encouraged by our capabilities to retreat into space just yet.
