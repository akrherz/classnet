===message:<br> I have worked with the Semester at Sea people and it is great! I assume that some of the international coastal stuff we are doing in class right now (Ocean's End)is familiar to some of the things you experienced and saw in your SAS trip.

===message:The one thing that stuck out in my mind from the SAS trip is from when we were pulling into port in Chennai, India.  There were thousands of brainless jellyfish just floating along from about a mile offshore until we reached port.  The water was disgusting and so were the jellies.  I had never seen so many of them in my life.  We just plowed right through them. <p>

The most beautiful beaches were definitely at the Seychelles.  Surprisingly, there was no armor at any of the beaches I was at.  They were all natural.  There were plenty of pot-smoking rastas that were also all natural Creole. <p>

A political FYI as well...the US does not have a consulate office in Seychelles.  It's administered by the office in Mauritius.  The "consular" officer that gave our briefing was a retired part-timer that came to the island on vacation in her younger days and never left.  She does the consular thing a couple days a week and is retired the rest of the time.  Just go show the level of interest the US has in Seychelles!
