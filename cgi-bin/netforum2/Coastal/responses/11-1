===message:I dont' even know where to begin. I have learned so much more than I would ever have expected. I have taken 140 credits at Iowa State and the Universidad de Valladolid in Spain and this is the first class (probably in my entire life) that I have enjoyed so much. It is the first class ever that I have been so genuinely interested in the topics and learning more about them that I was able to memorize facts and statistics without even studying and I've been able to have great conversations about all of the things that I have learned. It's amazing how much one can learn when it doesn't even feel like work! Amazing. <p> Visiting oceans and seas all over the world, from the North Sea, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic ocean from the coast of North Africa to the East coast of the States, the Pacific ocean from Alaska to the Panama Canal, and the Caribbean, I never realized how important the oceans and seas really are. I never stopped once to think about the consequences of all of the development on coasts and the consequences of seawalls, groins, breakwaters..etc. I've sailed past so many of these structures, stood on them, ate lunch on them  and never once thought about the effects and consequences that come with them. This class has opened my eyes! and has really allowed me to grow personally. <p> As far as my academic and professional endeavors, this course has introduced even more possibilities. I am also majoring in International Business with an emphasis on transportation and logistics and I never realized the impact of the role of the oceans, harbors, ships etc.  and how much they relate to my area of study.  <p> After this course is finished, I will continue being proactive in coastal issues and keep myself updated.  This class has been a wonderful experience for me. Thank you.

===message:I would have to say that I have learned alot more than I new before I started to take this course.  Before I took this course I was unaware of any of the problems with the coastal zones/waters.  I am amazed at all of the pollution that takes place in these waters.  I always new that pollution was a problem, but not this bad.  The most interesting part to me is the statisitics about hurricanes that were discussed in our class book.  Hurricane Andrew cost 24 billion in damage.  That is an enormous amount of money.  Ten small insurance companies went bankrupt after Hurricane Andrew produced 15.5 billion in covered damages.  I can't beleive that at least 80% of Americans live within an hour drive of the coast, and that half of the u.s population will live in coastal counties by the year 2010.  This is just some of the information that I found to be very interesting.  I like to learn about these topics because before I wasn't very knowledgeable about any of this.  I still can't beleive how beaches are being ruined by construction of beach homes.  I never had a clue that this had an effect. I find all of the information I have learned very effective and interesting and it has opened my eyes to all of these issues.

I believe that the most interesting thing I learned so far is that so many people have such naïve and unrealistic attitudes concerning environmental and coastal issues.  I have to say that I admire the individuals in this course for their energy and attitudes concerning the preservation and conservation of our coastal areas.  However, I believe that their energies in addressing specific problems are exerted in the wrong direction. 
<p>
 The root problem must be exposed.  The problem isn?t as clear-cut as engineering and human overpopulation etc.  The root problem lies in our current world mindset and philosophy.  Can anyone say ?Bretton Woods?? It is here that government leaders become weaker and economic leaders become more influential.  As government leaders moved from dutiful government servants serving public interests to corporate lapdogs.  Environmental issues and concerns fell along the wayside to accommodate the weeding out of ?inefficiencies in the system.?  Don?t understand what I?m talking about? You will!  
<p>
If a person truly wants to make effective change in society regarding environmental issues we need to address the problem by exerting our energies in the correct direction.  We need to actively participate in our political system.  We need to actively identify, recruit, groom and support individuals with similar environmental and social ideas and place them in public offices. I could go on about education initiatives but that would take to long.

===message:I have learned many things in this class that have definitely caught my interest.  I had no idea how damaging building and development on the coast is to beaches before I took this class.  I have visited beaches in Florida and South Carolina but I never realized the impact that humans are having on these delicate places.  I'd never stopped to wonder about what effects a seawall might have on the beach or the problem of building houses right on the beach.  It seems ironic and sad that people's desires to be closer to the beaches are what is putting such pressure on them.  The one thing that had the biggest impact on me was learning about the Mississippi River, the Gulf of Mexico, and actions right here in Iowa.  It is really amazing how connected everything is.  It goes to show how ignorant we as humans have been in ignoring the repercussions of our actions. (Another example of this is large, industrial nations and global warming).  One fact that really stood out to me was the fact that the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico doubled in size after the floods of 1993 here in the Midwest!  I have found myself telling people about this and wanting to discuss other issues (like the Marshall Islands)that I have learned about in this class.
