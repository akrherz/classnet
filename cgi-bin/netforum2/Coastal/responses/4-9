===message:<P>Interesting that you note that a country who has little history of upholding the rights of indigenous people should respect such rights.

<P>Should we not allow them to kill just one whale in the ancient tradition?  What happens if the specie's population dwindles to a small handful?  Do we continue to respect their traditions?  Why should we grant special rights to a group of people because of their ancient tradition that we do not afford to normal American citizens? Why should one uphold the claims of an "outdated" treaty as you say?

<P>The tribe does not need the whale to sustain existence.  There is little real reasoning behind the hunting other than to maintain a tradition.  But traditions are not fixed norms; they evolve to social and environmental expectations.  Once acceptable traditions have changed.  The American teenage pastime of vrooming muscle cars has become largely extinct as scarcity of oil has increased associated costs and new more efficient, less harmful technologies have been and continue to be developed.

<P>How is the whale different?  Scarcity has increased the social costs of hunting a whale.  Technology has made the need to do so obsolete.
