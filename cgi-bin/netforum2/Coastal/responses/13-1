===message:There are definite consequences of implementing policies to reverse the decline of coastal areas and oceans. The rapid exploitation and development of coastal areas along with augmenting population growth and urbanization have led to environmental degradation of world-wide marine ecosystems. The coastal and offshore area, as we have learned, is an economically important zone where fishery, mineral and oil exploitation and tourism contribute significantly to the financial well-being of coastal countries. There are obvious implications to enacting the coastal policies discussed in the book. They affect property value, insurance costs, tax payers, coastal research; however, the positives outweigh the negatives. <p> Integrating the 3 levels--local, state, and federal to reverse the decline of coastal areas and oceans is the optimal goal. The book addresses integrated coastal zone management policies to reverse the decline of coasts. I think one of the consequences is simply the fact that it is very difficult to integrate the ideas, rights, and priorities of local, state, and federal policies because there are many conflicting constituencies. It seems to me that they almost all have different agendas and this makes it difficult.
