===message:It has happened and it will happen again.  You couldn't even count the number of times the Black Sea has been polluted and misused.  Every time the sea is polluted we are losing life at extremely high amounts.  Another reason this won't stop is because who is going to stop pollution and as far as I know we probably don't even know how many companies, factories, etc. have access to dump and pollute any kind substance.  Those who take part in pollution are not going to admit to this.  It would almost be impossible to prevent this problem all together.  There has to be some way that it can be controlled.

===message:I believe that this type of pollution is already occuring in the United States.  For example Colin Woodard points out that along the Mississippi river people refer to a particual stretch of the river as "Cancer Alley".  I think this is an indication that we are experiencing the same type of the pollution and the effects as what is occuring in the Black Sea.  Also the fact that certain facilities release a billion pounds of toxins in a year.  This is actually very hard for me to put my mind around.  I might feel a little better if the government where doing something about this, but their is no sign of slowing down.<p> The result of all these pollutants creates the Dead Zone which deprives the aquatic life the oxygen it needs to servive.  With this said I belive that we are making just as many stupid mistakes as other govermental bodies governing the Black Sea.  What I dont understand is why we dont take lessons from what is happening to other's concerning their environment and apply them to our own situation.
