===message:Building on the coast should come with the same level of responcibility of building in a flood plain, the 'tornado alley,' or a fault line in California.  I believe risks should be evaluated, and the corperation and/or organization building there should understand the given risks.<br><br>
I have to disagree with what Kaiphat said, the insurance costs should be taken up by the owner of the finished product.  A contractor was hired to build a given project in a given area, so the insurance cost should be taken up by those who own the area, and not the builders.

===message:I also agree with Jacob and Kaiphat, that the builder's (owners) of the property should be responsible for their own land considering they primarily made the choice to build in such a "high-risk" area. Going off what Jacob said about property owners in Tornado Zones, or flood plains, I feel that insurance companies should have a very high insurance rate for people who build or own property near these coastal areas considering the increase in risk of damage from natural disasters. I also feel that in case of a disaster, the taz payers in that certain region should have a greater tax in order to pay for clean-up and relief.
