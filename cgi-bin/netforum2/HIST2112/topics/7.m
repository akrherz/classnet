===message:   <p>The great depression was a horrible time for industrial workers and farmers who lived in the Great Plains and the mid-west.  In some ways the depression for rural citizens had life worse than that of city dwellers.  The economic decline and the dust storms that began in 1932 determined the poverty that the farming communities would have to endure until WWII would come around.</p>
   <p>The photographs that Lange and Rothstein took during this time period can greatly describe the reality of the depression.  The goal of these photographers was to get candid shots, in which would describe the actual way life was during the depression for the rural people in the western part of the nation. They wanted to make sure that the people who saw their pictures would be able to see the truth of the situation.  Most importantly, the FSA wanted accurate and truth telling pictures, to show how their camps built in California were relieving poverty stricken citizens and helping out rural America.  The importance of this was because the wealthy landowners in California were looking to lobby against the camps in Washington, stating they were of “socialistic” nature and had “communistic” goals.</p>
   <p>The two pictures that were taken of the women with their children were taken to show how truly poor and hopeless they were.  Lange’s portrait of the “Migrant Mother” clearly shows all the individuals in the picture with old tattered clothing.  The child’s head rested on the mother’s shoulder can be seen as a symbol of putting his trust in the mother to get through the tough time, or might be seen as having feelings of hopelessness.  The facial expression on the mother clearly shows her desperation to provide for her baby and young son.  However the picture is perceived, the family is in a dire need for economic stability to just provide for the daily necessities of the family.  For the common farmer during this time, with failed crops and overdue loans, the common farmer would be lucky to break even with the declining prices.  It wasn’t a positive outlook during the depression for any hard working farmer.</p>
   <p>The pictures of the FSA camps were taken to show an “all-American” character of the camp life.  The purpose of taking these strategic pictures was to show the public that these camps were built to provide and help out the farming communities during the depression.  The pictures show the houses built of steel, which would endure the dust storms and prevent any unnecessary cleaning of the entire house.  The pictures also showed recreation of the camps, such as women embroidering, dance clubs, and people playing music.  The FSA camps did draw opposition due to the fact that it was a nonprofit camp and workers volunteered their services.  During a time of depression, individuals who wanted to regulate the economy and provide for equality would be against such a camp.</p>
   <p>The great depression was an awful era that struck against all common laborers, industrial workers and farmers.  The only people who didn’t feel as threatened by this economic crisis were the extremely wealthy individuals.  The “Dust Bowl” was the Western states which went through not only the depression but also the inability to produce crops to the greatest extent.  Drought had taken its place against the productivity of the crops.  The FSA camps assisted somewhat to the farming communities primarily in California.  True recovery wouldn’t occur in America until or after WWII.</p>

===message:In the Dust Bowl photographs we see desperate men, women and children struggling to survive the depression.  Their homes have been swallowed up by the earth and their plates are empty.  These photos produce the hoplessness of the mid-western farmers who have fought against nature and have lost.  In contrast, the Visalia photos show these once stranded families well fed, well housed, and well cared for.  The photos go to great lengths to stress what the government had done to save these wretched people. No longer are they vagabonds wandering through the desert hanging on to life by a thread.  Thanks to "camps", they now can start a new life.  

The first analysis shows the devestation of nature and economics during the depression.  These were real people experiencing real problems; it was a true depression.  The second analysis shows how America worked together to bring itself out of the depression.  It shows the determination of its people to band together and pull themseves up by their bootstraps, so to speak.  Both sets of photos were equally impressive.  I did find it interesting that they were not candid.  I always thought they were.  I guess that is part of why they are considered art.  Interesting article.

===message:Rural Americans had hard times worse than any during the Great Depression.  Farmers, sharecroppers and farm labor experienced what was called the "Dust Bowl".  A drought that devastated the mid west.  Farmers were wiped out by dust storms and crops destroyed.  Farm families had no means to recover.  The Visalia pictures show what life was like during this period of time.  It was Camp life for most.  Each picture tells a story of how they tried to survive.  Lange's famous picture of the "migrant mother" with her children, the expression on her face reveals the devastation.  Rothstein's picture of the "dust bowl" shows how clearly life was with the farmer and sons being covered in dust.

===message:The devastation of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl combined is evident in the photographs.  The facial expressions of the mothers are heart wrenching.  You can virtually feel their pain.  Their children are hungry and looking to her for protection and support.  The weight of this responsiblility shows in her face.  There are no rays of hope evident here.
The picture of the father and son walking in the dust storm was very realistic.  Even though you could not see thier expression, you could still sense the pain, fatigue, and loss they were feeling.   The size of the objects that the photograper used in this photograph helped me to realize the real depth of this time.  The people looked bigger than the building because there was so much sand.  As I thought about this, it made me realize that I could not even imagine how awful this was for these people.


In contrast, the photo of the FSA camp was very neat and orderly.  Everything was well mancuired and looked perfect.  The photographer accompolished this with the placement of props, such as a woman embrodering and children playing.  I got the impression that this was a government commercial-Look, what I've done for you, lately.  I also thought that even though the houses were built of steel, they could still be made into a home.  These pictures portray a much happier time and hope for the future.

===subject:Pictures worth a thousand words
===message:Both sets of photographs including the Visalia and the pictures captured by Lange and Rothstein depict different emotions, but yet both capture the monsterous effects of the Great Depression and Dust Bowl. 

The earlier pictures taken by Lange and Rothstein depict a life of devastation and misery. Photographs display helplessness and the feelings of being overpowered by an uncontrollable monster...the Dust Bowl. A lot of the pictures show the effects of the dust bowl driving people from their farms, homes, etc. I feel that the Migrant Mother is the most touching photograph...it definately lives up the old saying that a picture is worth a 1,000 words. Although this is a black and white photograph the dirt appears to be covered over the mother, child, and baby's clothing showing that the Dust Bowl has truly engulfed everything. I think the single empty plate is of important notice. The mother and the child seem to be looking towards the life that has been swept away with a feeling of sadness, a bit of anger for what has happened, but most of all a feeling of not knowing what is going to happen next. 

The Visalia photographs told a different story and evoked emotions as well. These photgraphs displayed a different time of life...these pictures were taken after the victims of the Dust Bowl were going through a recovery process. These pictures were taken at the camp and they seem to display happy, safe feelings free from the pain of the Dust Bowl. However, with it being clearly known that the photographer staged for instance the lady embroidering in the home you wonder what the true emotion was. It would be interesting to view pictures of the same lady that was not staged. I'm sure that the true emotion in her face would display the happiness to be a surviving and recovering, but the horrible sadness of loss. All of the pictures such as the Baby Clinic, the meetings, etc. look incredibly fake...it looks as if it is an attempt for the government to show proof of their so called good deeds to the victims of the tragedies. All of the pictures display things that the government has provided or is giving to the victims.

Both sets of photographs provoke emotions especially of sympathy for the people, families of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. The pictures give a glimpse into the pain, loss, and helplessness due to the horrible circumstances of the time.

===message:It's umimaginable for us to realize the desperation and hopelessness that was felt during the Dust Bowl.  As a modern, civilized society today, we have never experienced something that would literally bring us to our knees, as back then.  Luckily for us, there are pictures and accounts of this time period for us to study and learn from.  The "Migrant Mother" photograph speaks of lost hope, confusion as to what to do next, desperation for help and hope of a better future.  The detail captured in this photo speaks more than any book could describe.  She humanizes this tragic period of time with her children.

Another photograph of the "camps" also speaks volumes. These pictures were staged to show and "sell" a better life.  To someone living on a farm during the Dust Bowl, losing everything, dirty constantly, and not knowing what to do next, a photo of steel homes that block the dust, the promise of security and a future are almost too much to ask for.  These pictures constrast each other because to look at them, you wouldn't think they were taken of the same event and time.

===message:The pictures of the "Migrant Mother" truly express the heartache and desperation of the depression.  You can almost feel her disgust and sadness just by looking at her picture.  The children even display a sense of desperation.  I think that the empty plate means alot more than just an empty plate.  I think it stands for a period of great need and hardships.  In contrast, the pictures of the Visalia camp were an attempt to cover up the sadness of what was lost.  The government tried to use these pictures to masquerade camp life.  For example:  the baby clinic demonstrating "socialized medicine", the recreation hall demonstrates "all-American" ideals, the Women's club demonstrates "respectibility", etc.  Although these pictures look staged, it's exactly what the government ordered.

It showed the despair of a nation during the depression. The picture of the woman holding her child, it shows how the country was trying to hold on to their valuable things during such a time of need. The other picutre of the man running with his child through a dust storm was like people ducking for cover from the whirlwind of deppression. Then the pictures taken by the Visalia camps try to cover up these issues demonstrated by Rothstein and Lange. Its sad how the government can cover up what is true with such ease.

===message:In the earlier pictures taken by Lange and Rothstein, the photographs suggest a trying time for America.   For example, in the picture with the man and his son walking into the dust storm, they appear to be in a deserted area and they have their heads hanging as though they are distraught.   The background looks very eerie and threatening.   In addition, the picture by Lange that shows the woman and her child suggest the hardships, poverty,and misfortune that people endured as a result of the Depression; their clothes are dirty and tattered, they look desolate, and there is an empty plate in front of them.   These photographs suggest the suffering of America's economy, morale, and the awful effects the Depression had on families, particularly the children.   In the later Visalia photographs, the people seem to be oblivious to the detriments of the Depression.   They appear to be clean, the homes appear to be well-maintained, and they even seem to be having a grand time (as the pictures of the dancing and socializing suggest).  This is a different perspective of the Depression; one that reflects the efforts to reconstruct and boost the morale of the otherwise suffering American public.   The pictures attempt to depict the life in the camps that were aimed at restoration and reconstruction as "all-American"...harmonic and socially productive.   These photos allow us to not only see the different experiences of Americans during the Depression, but also to see the different perspectives of how Americans viewed the Depression or how they were personally affected by it.

Their father, long gone along with the stock market. How dismal and bleak it must have been. Eventually, the children became the victims of family welfare services and were placed into foster homes.

===message:In Lange’s “Migrant Mother”, she portrayed the mom as very poor, slightly tired-looking, but still showing much strength.  Her children are in rags and they are standing in front of a shanty-tent.  This portrays the desperate state of migrants who went wherever there was work to be found and took their kids with them, mostly to help with the work.  This is in stark contrasts with “Steel Cabins house individual families” which shows a healthy mother mom pulling a plump, clean child in a wagon past a neat, sturdy steel house.  It is apparent there is no food lacking and this home is so much better that the shanty-tent pictured in “Migrant Mother”.
<p>
Rothstein's  “Farmer and Sons” shows the desperate state of farmers during the Dustbowl.  It is obvious there are no crops in the fields because the fields no longer exist, taken over by the drought and dust.  The little boy in the back appears particularly helpless because he looks like he could be blown away with strong wind. This contrasts well with “Well-baby Clinic” which show 2 healthy, fat, well-fed, clean, babies and a young, very healthy mother getting medical care.  There is obviously no want for food, clothes, or medicine and everyone appears happy.
<p>
The Great Depression forced farmers and migrant workers to flee from areas were there was no work, good or money. The first set of photographs depicts well just how bad the Depression was and the showed that is effected the “common” man and his family. Those photographs brought the plight of the farmer and migrant worker to the attention of the public because they were published in many newspapers. People were very proud about being financially independent and did not go to camps like Visalia until the simply had to.   When the President set up camps like the one at Visalia and commissioned photographers from the FSA to document them, he was anxious to portray the camps as communities that were united and that helped the “regular” guy to get back on his feet.  This program, as part of the New Deal, help Roosevelt win re-election.

represented the conditions of a vast majority of “Americans” during the depression.  The basic necessities were becoming a thing of luxury.  Children were starving & suffering from malnutrition, and rickets.  Embarrassed mothers sent kids to school hungry and in rags.  While in contrast Visalia “Steel House” represents Hoover’s reputation as a cold & aloof protector of the privilege classes.  By the way he responded to the Bonus Marchers (1932) and in general to he response to the overwhelming suffering of the masses.  He flatly dismissed the notion of curing poverty by the enactment of law.

The first set taken were at the worst of the storm, pre New Deal organizational involvement.  As the text conveyed, the picture was, albeit based upon reality, posed.  The second set, post New Deal organizational involvement, was also posed.  The pictures were predominantly before and after shots.  They were resoundingly "look at me" pictures that were altogher political in nature.  These pictures show the harsh reality of our political system--most political leaders will take horrible circumstances, intervene, typically bettering the situation, and then turn it into a vote.

The picture is bare of life, ruins dot the landscape, sand is everywhere, and their are no clouds. These things show that their was little to no family life, nothing was growing, people had moved from rural areas, and everything was sad. The second picture contained people, things were neat and orderly, their were houses, and clouds. The people suggest that families were being created again, order had been restored, and that things were happy and looking up for many people.

Clean homes and recreation areas allow for good living while the earlier pictures of the Dust Bowl show huge dust clouds engulfing everything in sight.  Barren land, broken homes and desperate people abound.  These pictures leave you feeling broken hearted because you can almost feel the dispare and worry of those who lived off the land.  The great depression was a time of scarcity and fear.  Those who benefited from the New Deal programs were lucky because some of the programs just did not work.  Rural workers were impacted by the great depression just as industrial workers.  Times were hard all over, but if you were lucky enough to have money or receive government assistance than you were better off than most.

The Dust Bowl pictures present an America that is deserted and hostile.  The land looks extremely rugged and unable to grow profitable crops.  It looks like a wasteland.  The pioneers of America depended on harvesting and growing crops and being able to have a market for it.  During the Dust Bowl, the money that came out of farming looked impossible to obtain.

The land is completely void of any vegetation and the building is in shambles.  In one of Lange’s Migrant Mother pictures, the woman looks as if she has no hope.  She appears greatly worried because there is no work for her and there is nothing that she can do with her three children.  The children, close to their mother in tattered clothes, can only face backward - there isn’t anything for them to look forward to.

In contrast, the Rothstein picture of the people at the camp hall shows them well dressed, socializing and dancing.  These people obviously have time for recreational activities and have some money.  In another picture, the nicely dressed woman is pulling her child in a wagon and they are shown in front of decent-looking houses.  

The first set of pictures showed the great desperation and wretchedness many families had to endure during the depression in the rural areas.  At the same time, with the government’s help from the New Deal, people were shown to have a better life at the camp, almost making life seem enjoyable again. These pictures, all posed, show that the government (FSA) was trying to form false images in order to show the rest of America that the New Deal was a great idea and was actually working
