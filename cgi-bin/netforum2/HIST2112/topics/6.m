===message:I feel the way the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's helped celebrate the racial difference from society was it established a time where African Americans celebrated themselves and their talents. The great migration had brought thousands of African Americans together to New York City.  They were singers, actors, artists, musicians that strongly influenced some of "white america" culture.  For instance,  the Jazz Age.  To be black in America in the 1920's meant that you were separate from white America. You also had to be more assertive with white America.

The rise of the "New Negro" was different in the respect that they had become alone in their struggle's and the civil rights movement was a way for them to gain strength in white america.

===message:<p>The rise of the “New Negro” in the 1920s was different then the civil rights movement in that the African Americans did not push for equality or civil rights during the 1920s.  Even though they were able to create their own culture of musical taste and in the arts, segregations were still the rule by law in the South and custom in the North.  During the 1920s, African Americans were still largely economically unequal with white Americans. this was a time in which the nation would generally at least begin to accept the works and ideas of African Americans, in various arts and music.</p>      
   </p>One major concept that the Harlem Renaissance created was a new cultural terrain for African Americans.  They began to move out of the southern states and swarm into the northern industrial areas, primarily in New York City.  The Harlem Renaissance allowed for a time that African Americans would be able to portray their own accomplishments.  This was done primarily through arts and music.  Jazz music was an entertaining hit in the 1920s.  Among musicians, poets, novelists, painters, and other artists began to develop and present their ideas.  These were the various areas where African Americans could celebrate their differences from the rest of society.  Even though their works were beginning to be accepted, this was still a time in our history in which racial differences were strong.  A major example to point out is that Langston Hughes had his poetry read at an all-white gathering.  He was not a guest of this party, but a waiter.  Even though his works were accepted, as an individual and the customs of society of that time, he was not allowed to participate in the gathering formally.  Opportunities therefore did start to allow for a compromise of segregation, but not until the Civil Rights movement would true equal opportunities be available to all people.</p>
   <p>I believe to be black in the 1920s meant that the African American people could freely present their ideas and thoughts at least partially for the first time in our history.  They also created their own culture of musical taste, arts and began to come together as communities in areas such as New York.  This was a period of time in which the “New Negro” was able to freely express and begin to be fully accepted in ways of intellect and ideals.  The 1920s was only a small forecast of what would come during the Civil Rights movement.</p>

===message:The "New Negro" of the 1920's differed from the later civil rights generation in that they were more militant and assertive in regards to mistreatment by whites.   During the 1920's is when the actively strong African American organizations formed: the NAACP and the UNIA.   During this time, there was a "return to Africa, our homeland" sentiment among many African Americans, which further demonstrated the resistance of African Americans to assimilate or integrate into "White America".   This was unlike the civil rights movement era, by which time African Americans had established their ground that they were just as entitled to live and enjoy the benefits and opportunities of America that all the whites possessed; the movements by African Americans during this time demonstrated a deeper knowledge and use of politics to establish rights and opportunities for African Americans.   This was done through many groundbreaking demonstrations and court cases.

The Harlem Renaissance allowed blacks to celebrate their racial difference from the rest of society by giving blacks a sense of unity geographically (Harlem, NY), where many African Americans migrated to during the early 1900's), while individually (as a race) giving themselves a sense of distinction through an era of creativity that reflected the African American culture, voice, and perserverance.   They developed unique and enduring works of poetry, music, and literature during this time that allowed them to experience a sense of freedom that had for so long been denied: the freedom to celebrate their "blackness".   

In the 1920's, to be black meant to still have to endure discrimination, for segregation was still in practice-as law in the South and custom in the North.  There were more opportunities for blacks, but with the inequality and discrimination, it was extremely frustrating.  Even with the creativity of the Harlem Renaissance, unique to the African American community, many blacks still experienced discrimination.   For example, in music, they did receive the recognition they deserved because many records made by black musicians were not played on the radio and not sold in many stores.

===message:
The "New Negro" in the 1920's had several significant differences as compared with later civil rights generations. In the 1920's the "New Negro" was establishing a new life and new environment. Many African Americans were beginning new jobs places like New York City far from the Southern life. Also, many were returning home from assisting with the war and ready to enjoy the freedom that they had so greatly fought for. The 1920's would show African American's focusing more on their heritage and their homeland of Africa.

The Harlem Renaissance was of significant importance because it did provide an opportunity for African Americans to celebrate their talents through their artistic work of paintings, music, etc. Although there was not a huge stride made for equal opportunities for African Americans many people began to take notice of their talents and contributions through the time known as the Harlem Renaissance. 

From the historical information I have read I believe that it would be very difficult time for an African American in the 1920's...it was a time of celebration, but also  a time of sorrow as well. Although the Harlem Renaissance provided an outlet for blacks to display their unique talents it was also a reminder of the unfair discrimination that was inflicted upon them. There were many incredible talented musicians who did not receive equal treatment as compared to the white performers....the African Americans music wasn't sold in record stores and they were contantly inflicted with harsh discrimination.

The later civil rights generation was different than the generation of the 1920's. The earlier generation was forming a new life and new idenity as well as establishing and organizing representation through advocates such as W.E.B. DuBois, NAACP, and the UNIA. The later generation began fighting for and enforcing their rights that was theirs...as illustrated through the civil rights movement of the 1960's. 

An extra note...I thought a lot about the many talented contributors to the Harlem Renaissance...the poets, musicians, etc...I can't imagine the happy feelings the artists enjoyed as they got to express themselves through their wonderful talents only to be inflicted with constant discrimination of not getting the same opportunities to display their talent...the battle to display the art in museums, selling records in music stores, etc. It surely had to be a time of happiness, but continued feeling of sadness because of the unfair discrimination.

===message:This period was a positive step towards equality for African Americans.  The Harlem Renaissance was a time when African Americans could live and express the ideals of their own cultures through music and art.  In a way, this was a stand against "White America".  Thus reinforcing the idea that the African Americans couldn't value and uphold all of the ideals of "White America". The migration to New York also indicated the need to merge together.  The "New Negro"  showed a new sense of freedom and the ability to stand up to those who would discriminate against them.  I'm sure it was difficult to have such talent and still be burdened with inequality. Although a step was taken in the right direction, African Americans still lived with economic inequality.

===message:The rise of the "New Negro" in the twenties differed from the Civil Rights generation in that most of the people had not fully come to terms with who they were.  They were beginning to recognize their individuality, but had not totally grasped their autonomy.  In contrast, during the civil rights movement African Americans weren't satisfied in being "second class citizens", and rightly so.  Being confident as equal members of society, they let their voice be heard.

The Harlem Renaissance helped Blacks celebrate their racial differences from the rest of society in that through the media of the arts, they were truly free.  Their feelings, desires, intent, and expressions had no boundaries through art(music, theatre, painting etc).  They had no fear of the white man while writing poetry or singing.  For the first time they were able to express themselves. 

However, although Black Americans were able to express who they were on paper or through song, they were still limited to the reality that America was still a "white man's world".  To me, it would be like being a tiger in zoo with a natural habitat atmosphere, but knowing that you're still in a zoo.  Those people had more character than we could ever hope to have.  I hope we never forget what they worked for and what they went through.

===message:The “New Negro” in the 1920s differed from the 1960s civil rights generation in that they were not as bold.  The 1960s generation was completely unwilling to be stepped on any longer and died for equal rights. Similarly, the 1920s generation that fought in WWI was going to fight for democracy for black people.  They fought segregation and started organizations for black people that still exist today, like the NAACP. Without the foundation laid by the black people in the 1920s, it would have been much harder for the black people in the 1960s to keep the fight up, despite lynchings, murders, and persecution.
<p>
The Harlem Renaissance was a result of black people celebrating the fact that our culture is different from that of any other race. Merriam-Webster defines renaissance as “a movement or period of vigorous artistic and intellectual activity; rebirth” and this is what happened in Harlem in the 1920s.  The primary focus was on achievement in music, poetry, painting, and photography.  Jazz was a new form of music to come out of this era and was created by black people.  The Harlem Renaissance allowed black people to develop and showcase, to the extent that black people were allowed by white people, their talents and abilities. The late, great Duke Ellington had to contend with his lovely music being called “jungle music” because he was a black person.  All black artists and musicians of that time had to watch white performers mock them by appearing in “blackface” and also not receiving the credit they deserved as great artists, poet, writers, and musicians.
<p>
To be a black person in the 1920s meant that you had no rights, you were  still expected to “bow down” and to serve white people.  Black people could only be truly free in the midst of other black people, hence the reason for the extreme success of the Harlem Renaissance.  Even though black people created this “new culture” of supposed freedom and created jazz, they were still discriminated against.  Black people in the 1920s were more militant and assertive than in the past. It was a time when black people could see the light at the end of the tunnel, and knew that had to fight, even to the death, to get there and were ready for the challenge.  Black people were no longer content to be 4th class citizens.  
<p>
I am so glad that so many black people fought for the rights that we have now.  We still are not on an equal footing with white people economically and may not ever be because we are STILL discriminated against, especially in the South.  We have to remember that White people have a 100 year head-start on black people and have that great advantage of being born as a white person to begin life with. That advantage carries them throughout the rest of their life, almost unbeknownst to them. It amazes me that white people want to end “affirmative action” as though discrimination against black people no longer exists. Discrimination exists at every turn, from being pulled over for DWB (driving while black) to receiving lower salaries for the same jobs as white people.  It is possible to achieve great success as a black person in many areas because of the civil rights movement and the foundation that was laid by black people in the 1920s.

They did this as novelist, artists, musicians, and etc..  Many contributions from the time are still evident and well known today.  The jazz music and poetry are just two of these.  Their was some great inspiration present at this time in our history that stills inspires people of all colors. The "New Negro" was creating a new way of life in a new location.  Many had moved from the South to Urban areas.They were expressing and enjoying their new found freedom.  However, discrimination was still very much alive and blacks did not have the opportunties abailable to them that was present for many others.

The "New Negro" of the 1920s differed greatly from the later generation of the Civil Rights Movement.  In the 20s, blacks were just discovering and experimenting with freedom. I think they were probably consumed for a long time with just being able to express themselves more that ever.  They laid the groundwork for the Civil Rights Movement by forming the NAACP and other orgainizations.  The later generation approached matters with a more aggression and pushed and fought for equal rights.  They were not just satisified with freedom they also demanded equality.
I think that to be black in the 20s meant that you were still unequal to whites.  However, this was a time that blacks were creating their own cultures and was ralling for equality.  This was a time of new beginnings.
I agree with the responses so far concerning the existence of discrimination still today, but the generations before us fought hard to get where we are now.  I sincerly believe that equality will be reached totally in the future.

===message:The difference between the African Americans in the 1920's and the African Americans during the civil rights movement was the fact that they still were not defending themselves completely. The African Americans at that time were taking advantage of the fact that they could express themselves through music but they still were not getting what any human being deserved. They were still treated as lower. It didn't matter that they were now in the public with white people because they were still doing things that were not as important as they would like. The African Americans during the civil rights movement really fought for their rights as human beings. They actually took stands for what they believed to be true. Unlike in the 1920s where they took what they could get, not what they needed. 
The Harlem Renaissance allowed African Americans to express themselves through their music. It allowed them to show the way they felt toward the way they had been treated for so many years as slaves. The music helped them to show their culture and show there background. Their music was referred to as "jungle music". It still kept discrimination against them because it was pretty much referring to them as apes. 
In the 1920s, I could not really say what it meant to be black at that time. I guess it meant the opening of minds and the beginning of clearing of prejudice toward blacks. They were starting to become more free.

The migration of blacks to Harlem procured a kind of coming together, and this brought about a sense of comfort and opportunity that they had never known.  It seems that the blacks at this time were content with having a separate institution—they were okay with segregation because they were grateful that they were able to express themselves.  The fact that their world was still predominantly separate from whites was of no real consequence that they had yet realized.  As time went by, and blacks became more accomplished, due largely to this Renaissance, they became restless with being separate.  They wanted not only to be recognized for their talents and influence, but wanted to be recognized by all as an integral component of America’s past and future.
