===more:How well does the cartoon on page 4 of this unit in "Exploring America" capture the meaning of "White Man's Burden"? Based upon this cartoon and what you have read in this unit and the coresponding material in the text, are Americans racist, exploitive, and elitist when it comes to dealing with other people of the world? What were the views of Kipling, Tillman, and Twain on American imperialism? Was the United States justified in annexing the Philippines?
