===message:The first cartoon addressed the issue of religion in schools.  As stated, the Ameicans have had the reading of the bible since the beginning, however Catholics would say that it interfers with the holy religion.  Evans addresses this issue in his speech with the conclusion that a division betwen church and state would be deadly.  He supports his views with the fact that the illiteracy of Europe is basically because of the Catholics.
Evans draws upon the stereotypes and images connected with the Great Red Scare as he outlines the characteristics that an immigrant must possess.  He stresses that they must have a respect for the government and the law.  During the Red Scare there was a great concern about communist and Bolsheviks who were considered to have contempt for democracy.
Evans was not totally opposed to immigrantion, but he did feel that they must be of the right racial and national stock and have strong allegiance to America.

===message:In Wesley Evans' 1923 address, he was drawing upon the atereotypes and images connected with the Red Scare and the Americanization Movement; he made several comments stating the importance of the immigrants' allegiance and love for America.  He believed that assimilation was essential; however, he also felt that certain immigrant groups, as well as negroes and Jews, would always stand apart from Americans, regardless of the degree of assimilation. He believed that certain immigrant groups (such as Latins, Greeks, Balkan, and Slavs)were not able to make the assimilation into the American way of life because of certain inferiorities.  In addition, Evans remarked on the fact that Catholics had a divided allegiance, with God being foremost in line with government, which begged the question of loyalty among the immigrants who were Catholic.  He also mentioned that the most illiterate European countries were all Catholic countries, reflecting his own personal views regarding the effects that the Red Scare and Americanization had on him.

===message:<p>Hiram Evan’s was a man who strongly supported the Americanization movement.  He believed that the people in America should support American ideals and remove any attachments they might still be carrying from their previous nation of citizenship.  In his address of "The Menace of Modern Immigraion" he said that there “must be a spiritual wedding with the state – a kind and character of citizenship with no higher temporal loyalty shall exist or be permitted to exist.”  Evans was not against immigration as a concept, but was against people of other nations coming and not becoming Americanized.  Evans believed that Americans had a very high calling, in which we were a superior Christian nation.  He stated that Americans where mentally, physically, spiritually and materially better off than any other nation in the world.</p>  
   <p>With these high regards and standards for an American society, it is conceivable to see why Evans had some stereotypes against the major bodies of immigrants of peoples coming to the U.S.  He had several reasons against roman catholic immagration.  One of his attacks was against the fact that the Catholic people had a higher respect to the Church of Rome.  He felt that immigrants of Roman Catholic ethnicity would consider American citizenship second to the church.  He also discussed that the people were predominately taught to be loyal to the religious oligarchy which isn’t American by any means.</p> 
   <p>Evans also had some discrimination against African-Americans and Jewish peoples.  He believed that the African-American people would never attain any level that an Ango-Saxon individual could.  He believed they would never assimilate into the American society.  The Jewish people he thought were wanderers and would never have place they could call home and that they had customs of there own, which were inflexible.</p>
   <p>Hiram said a lot about how certain people groups would never be able to Americanize.  The era around WWI, the Great Scare, and the Americanization movement all contributed to why Anglo-Saxon American’s felt this way.  There was fear of immigrants living in American during WWI with loyalties to the fighting nations.  This is why a lot of anti-German issues, practices, and language were banned.  Many Eastern European nations were beginning to adopt the new type of government of Communism and this also shed some fear into American hearts.  This was a time in which it was desired that all peoples of the U.S. would consider themselves American and dismount any loyalties or feelings that were attached to their nation of birth.</p>
   <p>Evans wasn’t a man against immigration, but he did believe that some peoples would not blend well with the American society.  He was a strong supporter of the Americanization movement.</p>

===message:In the 1920s, the KKK attracted millions because of their opposition to immigration and anti-Catholicism views, because the climate of America after WWI (when the Irish / German – Americans strongly opposed the war as large immigrant groups).  The Anglo -Americans began to fear where the allegiances lied amongst (– American) immigrants, they began to feel threaten.  Hiram Evans strongly supported the Americanization movement and used the fears of the people to promote his agenda.  During this time immigration quotas were passed based solely on “race”.  Northern / western European (Anglo – Saxon felt kinship with) were given preference, while making it difficult for the southern / eastern Europeans (darker – skinned) immigrants to get into the U.S. Evans stated, “The British Isles, Scandinavia, Germany, Holland, and Switzerland have come people born to that divinely essential attitude.  Let more of them come.  They are our kinsmen in tradition and ideals.  But generations, nor centuries, cannot school the Latin, the Greek, the Balkan, and the Slav to that fundamental conception”.  
He is opposed to the melting pot mentality of immigration because of his fears “of people who cannot be assimilated”.  He uses the stereo - types like the cartoons to justify his narrow-minded bigotry, of the blacks (low mentality of savage ancestors, of jungle environment, is inherent in the blood). He doesn’t acknowledge the brutality of black people during slavery and afterwards at the hands of the (KKK) Anglo, (they use justification by dehumanization), or the slaughter of the “native Americans (original Americans) so his knowledge of savagery is warped to begin with.  He states there is not a semblance of racial hate in my heart, I say all this because it is true and must be said...He is here.  In love and justice must we ever promote his welfare, his health, and happiness, But not in this generation, nor any America will ever know, will real assimilation be possible.
Another absolutely unblendable element is the Jew; he has been a wanderer upon the face of the earth.  He has no national attachment. To him patriotism, as the Anglo-Saxon feels it, is impossible.  First he comes down on immigrants about their allegiance with their homeland and now he complains about the Jews not having a homeland. (This seems very contradictory to me).  “Jews are mercenary minded – money mad.  To get, “to have and to hold,” is their materialistic motto”, Once again the negative stereotypes to justify either his hate, or narrow-mindedness. He speaks about how “Our cause is true Americanism.  This means in all vital things a superior Christian civilization for America...We have the heritage, the resources, the opportunity, for the achievement of the noblest and best in human happiness and human power”.  He does not acknowledge that he too, is just another immigrant trying to hold onto his ethnic pride, culture, & religion.  While trying to live a free and prosperous life here in America, yet he feels justified in robbing others immigrants of those same rights.
His anti-Catholic views he justify by saying that the illiteracy of Europe is practically confined to Catholic countries (Italy, Spain, Greek, Serbia, etc.).  Is it unfair to suggest that Catholicism, if not actually desiring that condition, thrives upon ignorance?  He did
not like the fact that their allegiance first and foremost was with God and the church (the Vatican in Rome)

===message:“The Educator” portrayed the Irish School Commissioner and the Irish maid as sub-human; they are clearly styled to look like apes.  This just fomented the view that the Irish had low intelligence, probably because they took on low paying jobs & had a thick accent. Once again, the view is that different from the norm is “bad”. The huge influx of immigrants made Americans worry about “race suicide” or the loss of Anglo-Saxon “stock”.  What immense foolishness and baseless pride, which the Proverbs 16:18 says “is before a crash, and a haughty spirit before stumbling”! 
<p>
The “Shutting Out The Light” cartoon is  untrue of most immigrants. Many love America fiercely.  However, this was the opinion of the majority and was allowed to survive, fueled by groups like the American Legion.  The “Alien troublemakers” cartoon shows the arm of the steel workers as waving a red flag, contributing to the prevailing “Red Scare” since most steel workers were immigrants. Evans took that rage against immigrants and directed it toward KKK interests. He says his cause is “Americanism” and that any immigrant must keep the “door open to American ideas and ideals”, and in addition, have a respect for “constituted authority” in their hearts.  He fails to mention that the “constituted authority” would be biased, prejudiced, and small-minded. He is prejudiced against “the Latin, the Greek, the Balkan, and the Slav”.  He plays along with the “Step by Step” cartoon by saying that if immigrants are allowed to dominate our society, that we too, as depicted in the cartoon, will fall victim to the “chaos, catastrophes and uncertainties that characterize revolution”.  He stated that the “immigrant must be of the right racial and national stock and his highest allegiance must be to and for America”.  This statement is the height of arrogance because it completely disregards that fact that God is the highest authority, not a country.  Acts 5:29 says : “We must obey God as ruler rather than men”.   
<p>
Evans diverged from the general idea of the cartoons because felt that  only assimilation, on his terms, would bring about true social and political equality.  He uses the term un-eugenic, which Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary defines as: “a science that deals with the improvement (as by control of human mating) of hereditary qualities of a race or breed”. How absurd! As if all races aren’t the same : HUMAN. This term is from the year 1883 and should have been left back in that century. His group, the KKK, has very little, if any, power today, proving that Evans’ view of immigration is not the view of the majority of people in the United States.
<p>
Honestly, I only read the first few paragraphs on the second page.  I stopped reading with the statements Evans made about black people. As a black person, I was extremely offended. I think the amount I did read, 1.5 pages of the 3, is sufficient to prove that Evans was an uneducated, sadly misguided man.

I'm sure that Evans probably had all of these in mind when using this illustration of modern immigration.  Even then, people used the media to instill fear into the people of this country.  Can you say "Brain wash"?  For instance, the cartoon w/ the Irish Priest protesting the teaching of the Bible in school making the public think that Irish Catholics would eventually overturn Protestant practices; Evans used this same scare tactic in his article. Catholicism will bring illiteracy; Negro's are sub-human("but we must love them and treat them with respect")...ok; Jews are ok, but they are only after money and can never establish roots anywhere.  I can see where Evans uses the cartoons, Nationalism promo's and Red Scare tactics, but I am unclear how he diverges from these in his article or speech.  He contradicts himself quite frequently, as most mentally unstable people do, but I can't put my finger on where he floats away from the thrust of the articles on the web or the cartoons.

===message:
It is unfortunate that people like Hiram Wesley Evans can become so influential upon many people...especially when they posses such a ruthless, crude, unimaginable way of thinking...just the type of thinking that Evans possessed during the 1920's. America is a place for freedoms including freedom of speech, but Evans was too extreme.

The stage was already set for ill feelings towards immigrants due to the Red Scare. Because of negative events such as the mail bomb packages and the situation with N.Sacco and B.Vanzetti (p.652-553 in our textbook)the mood had been created for a sense of fear and reluctance. As our books states, "...Americans entered the 1920's with a sense of uneasiness. The were aware that their nation was now the world's strongest, but they were unsure about what that might mean for their lives." (p.654)

Evans played upon these feelings that Americans had encountered regarding immigrants. He argues that immigrants in America is a disaster and that there is no conceivable way for different races and religions to live together peacefully. In his speech, he states that "They cannot be merged because of insurmountable social, racial, and religious barriers. They will always stand apart from our own people." 

Evans had a certain advantage because of the feelings towards immigrants that was already present. He played upon these emotions that Americans were already starting to feel due to the Red Scare. Evans went to the extreme with his feelings and beliefs against different races and religions. As I read his speech I became more and more disgusted by the type of mentality that he possessed. It is unimaginable that a human being could produce ideals like his, attempt to support it with Christian beliefs, and then present them as the ultimate true authority.

===message:The Red Scare could be seen as a fear of communist, socialits, and anarchist.  It was a time of fear, sickness, and uncertainity. Americans feared a revolution was at hand and had many civil liberties witheld.  As Walter Lippman stated, Americans were "scared out of their wits!"  Increasing immigration brought a great battle of upholding the "American" ideals and their institutions.  As more and more immigrants arrived, Americans became concerned.  William Ripley stated that the US was "erruptive" meaning that there was a huge flow of immigrants.  In the cartoon "Our Educators", a display of racism to the Irish could easily be seen.  The cartoon depicted the Irish as unintelligent, apelike.  The threat of the catholicism of the Irish imposed a danger to the Americans ideals and institutions.  Wizard Hiram Wesley Evans played upon the fears that were already in place due to the Red Scare.  He spoke of sickness in comparison with the "Negro" and how these people could not uphold the ideals and passion for the name "American" and he also discriminated against Jews.  I think the cartoon is demonstrating the loss of Americans and their ideals.  The dragon swallowing the Americans might stand for the immigrants that have or are presumed as having taking aways certain ideals.  His speech used factual claims such as statistics in literacy and religious examples.  Once again, he used fear to help persuade his case.

From looking at the cartoons, basically there were some people out to insteal fear into the people by accusing the Immigrants of their shortcomings.  Immigrants came into this country to work hard and to make a better life for themselfs the American way.

===message:According to Evans being American is following what qualities that are set forth by society at the time. I do not believe it is possible to state what it means to be American as in the sense of an individual, but we can define it by a whole. To be an American is to be a group of people coming together to improve the quality of life and also be able to be the person they believe themselves to be. Weren't the Puritans looking for a place to live where they could be themselves with their religion. So how could they not allow others to do the same? 






I don't really understand the cartoon of "Our Educators" because why would an Irish man, who comes from a country where Catholicism is the norm, to tell and American, whose ancestors are more than likely Protestant, to not read the Bible? I don't know about anybody else but what were the cartoonists trying to portray that we are hipocrites. I guess so just like Evans when he doesn't know what he is talking about when he leaves the "Latins , Greeks, the Balks, and  the Slavs"  out of his list of people who can be assimilated to American culture. I guess he forgot that the person who discovered this country was of Latin decent. He forgot that Galileo discovered the uses of a telescope. He doesn't seem to know about how our uses of math started in the middle east which he probably doesn't even know there is such a place. It seems that the people who are illiterate, according to him, are really the people who discovered many things that we use today. It is unfortunate that he uses facts to back up his information but he does not show both sides to the facts he is trying to prove. It's also terrible that the klan can continue to be organized. How is it possible that even in the 21st century we are still discriminating just like they did in the last century and centuries and centuries before? Do we not learn from all the chaos and pain that is caused by these stereotypes? I guess not.

If anything, to achieve their own means, that is, to create a race with morals and values that the Ku Klux Klan designed as acceptable American traits.  Considering that there were many Germans at the time in our country, I can not help but to compare it to what Hitler tried to achieve in creating a "higher refined race", which may as well have created the Klan in the United States and influenced the Americans with their quest for a "higher race"...

===message:Fear has great power.  Indeed, the Ku Klux Klan was successful in the promotion of its ideologies throughout America in the 20s due to that very fact.  Evans built upon Americans’ fears.  Further, he took those very real and very valid fears of war and twisted them until they were altogether misplaced and exaggerated.  The cartoon images suggested that citizens with different ideas and goals were simply un-American and radicals.  The bomb in one cartoon played upon the fear of Americans and indicated that all immigrants that were not of Christian descent were lunatics who would stop at nothing until they shifted American democracy to Communism.  Instead of indicating the true, primary reasons that immigrants migrated to America—for a chance to earn a respectable living and freedom from persecution, it depicted these individuals as driven extremists who sought to destroy America.  It was interesting to me that while Evans played upon the stereotypes depicted by the cartoons, he also shied away from those depictions.  Evans did promote the idea that immigrants were extremists and un-American.  However, it seems to me the cartoons asserted that Americans were competent and able in their defense against the “extremists,” while Evans’ speech promulgated a feeling that Americans would inevitably succumb to the extremists’ influence.  In other words, the cartoon of the man with the bat showed that Americans were going to fight, to assimilate, etc.  Evans speech, to me, showed that he was untrustworthy of his fellow Americans—they might fall prey to the extremists and adopt their ideas.  Really, it seems a dichotomy exists.  While he attempts to promote the strong American, he is ultimately saying that if integration occurred, it would be the end to American ideals and religion, which doesn’t make a strong case for the American way.

The immigrants who were of Anglo-Saxon descent had to be intelligent, healthy, and have good values. 
    The stereotypes that diverged from the regular population's belief were those that described African-American's, Jewish people, and Roman Catholics. African-Americans could not be assimilated because of physical and mental differences according to Evans. Jewish people and Roman Catholics were discriminated against based on their religious preferences. These two have beliefs that make their religion more important than America which makes them suspect, as far as, loyalty to country is concerned.

The Ku Klux Klan did this with the Catholics, African-Americans, and even the Indians.  By putting the blame on someone for the problems of the nation, it made the problems easier to deal with.  One of the things that were put on these groups was the supposed lack of American values instilled in the groups as a whole.  Americanization, or the instillation of American beliefs and ideals, seemed like the best option and solution to the problems at hand.
