===message:
From my standpoint I believe that many Americans oppose unions and perceive them as "un-American" for several different reasons. A lot of Americans view unions as unfair because union members have representation and other advantages with their employer that the average non-union employee does not posses. The union basically represents the union worker and the employer has to go by an entirely different set of guidelines for the union worker than they do for the non-union worker. Americans feel that this is very unfair because in America all employees should be treated as equals and evaulated on the same scale.  Also, it seems that a lot of people that would have once been union members are joining the ranks of the other Americans who oppose unions because they are unhappy with the way a union operates...for instance potential union members may not feel comfortable with the idea of giving their support and money to a union that ultimately will decide the employee's fate...such as when a union decides to go on strike...the employee may not necessarily agree that it's the right thing to do and may not be financially equipped to do that, but the union employee does not necessarily have a voice in the matter, because the union has spoken for him or her. Also, I can imagine that a lot of Americans feel hostility towards unions because they feel that their beliefs are hard to understand and that the union's behavior creates distress and often times violence. Past examples such as the Homestead Strike only contribute support to this idea. Obviously several violent outbursts and certain union members shouldn't be a good representation of all unions. For instance our history readings show that the union members at Homestead were not pleased with Berkman's actions towards Frick. The union members were very displeased because they saw that behavior was something that could be held against them. Goldman and Berkman thought that Berkman's act of trying to kill Frick would be seen as heroic...they thought that Berman's act was going to bring a huge change. These two people were definately viewed as radicals because of their extreme behavior that they displayed. Prior to the Homestead Strike and after that incident both Berkman and Goldman continued their excessive measures to get themselves recognized...although it was always in a very negative way. J.Edgar Hoover made it his mission to deport both Berkman and Goldman. Hoover wrote in a letter concerning the two radicals that they were, "beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country." Berkman and Goldman's goals weren't obtained from the Homestead Strike and the union members did not reach their goal of ultimately winning the war. Although our textbook states that, "Homestead became one of labor's most celebrated battles," but this particular battle ended up accomplishing benefits primarily only for the employer...the steel company. Carnegie's company was able to utilize police and many more techniques to break the union at the Homestead incident. The end result was that the employer ultimately won...as often happens in the employment world the rich (employer) get richer and the poor (employees) get poorer.

They did not try to educate themselves or anyone else on ways to handle their problems. Maybe if Berkmen would have studied laws pertaining to their situation and made the people understand what steps to take and what people to talk to help with the situation he would have had more followers. Instead, he took the ignorant violent approach and was shunned for it.

===message:Historically, many Americans have been opposed to unions because it brings the people together in an organization that seems almost "defiant" towards the corporation.   And since the corporations are working alongside the government, it seems as though unions may be an anti-government mechanism...or as if they are scrutinizing the corporation and government under a "checks and balance" type system.   In addition, unions have seemed to have less power and organizations than many major corporations in the past.   Goldman and Berkman were seen as radicals because they were for the unions and felt that major corporations were depriving workers of basic human/civil rights; they were seen as being revolutionists as far as the views that they had during that time.

Berkman and Goldman were seen as radicals because of their outlandish behavior and anarchism views.  They mainly wanted to be noticed.
The Homestead strike of 1892 was considered a turning point in the battle between labor and capital, with capital winning the war.  It put an end to the Amalgamated Iron and Steel Workers in Homestead and to trade unionism in the industry until the late 1930's.  The big company once again was victorious.

===message:<p>Americans have been opposed to unions, because they basically take most of the power and authority out of the employer’s hands.  In a union, the laborers were able to set the standards for the pace of work and regulations on the job.  This allowed the employers little room to mangage work and production.  Americans have also been against unions because it sets the workforce apart between union and non-union environments.  One of the main ideologies in American is equality.  When the laborers of one factory have more freedoms and choices in work then a factory that doesn’t have these freedoms, this brings the level of equality down, in the eyes of American workers.  Unions can been see as “un-American” because it is basically taking authority and rules away from the workers.  This is equivalent to taking power away from our local authorities or federal government.  These are just a few reasons why unions have not been very popular in our history.</p>
   <p>Berkman and Goldman were seen as radicals, because they went to extreme measures and had beliefs that were un-democratic.  They tried to handle their convictions through acts of anarchy and attempted murder.  When Berkman and Goldman heard of the strike in homestead they were more than thrilled to go support the cause of the strike.  Being immigrants they had feelings of needing more power to the laborer and by participating would be a great way to support their beliefs.  Their feelings as radicals became apparent when Berkman attempted to murder Frick.  This action was at the greatest extreme, which was against federal law.  These two radicals were anti-government and had no intuition to try and solve things the legal way.  The United States has been set up upon laws and government, which these two individuals directly disobeyed.  When anyone acts differently than the majority of the people and practices, they won’t only be rejected, but also punished in this case, by being deported back to the Soviet Union.</p>
   <p>The Homestead strike did not accomplish anything positive for the laborers.  If anything it made the public loathe unions even greater, after the attacks and loss of life.  The strike ultimately benefited the employers and the business owners, making their cooperation stronger.</p>

Even though the steel company appeared glamous from afar.It was only a matter of time before the workers would rebell. The hard work, the heat and the jobs seemed inhuman, something had to be done.

===message:In a way, it could be that Americans do not like unions because they want everyone to work together even with the "boss." We are the UNITED States of America, so they could want it to apply to jobs. Also, Goldman and Berkmen were considered radicals because they believed in anarchism and that was going against the whole united as americans idea. They could really be considered the hippies of the 19th century because of there difference in their views.  They believed the government to be the enemy and that is why Berkmen tried to assassinate Frick. Really, in the end, the Homestead Strike did not accomplish anything at all. It allowed the workers to let out anger that they felt about the way their life was, but afterward almost everyone came back to work for the same jobs and for the same pay and in the same conditions. It was everything or nothing for survival. That is what really matters, especially in those times.

===message:I believe most Americans dislike unions because nobody likes a loser.  Pre1850's, workers had a bargaining chip, they could perform complicated tasks that not everyone could do.  As technology entered the scene, the workers leverage was lost.  They could threat to go on strike.  The employer would be fine with that -- they would hire new employees at lower wages to do the same jobs without losing productivity.  Most regular employees fail to realized that there job is nonexistant if production is not made, especially where there is lots of competition in the marketplace.  Also, unions have been notoriously poor negotiators because they operate on such a low budget, they fail to hire top executives that can really help their cause in contract talks.  Work pace was also mentioned in the reading.  In the late 1970's, Hormel Foods Corperation (yes, producers of Spam) paid their employees a regular wage plus a bonus for increased production.  Production standards were jointly determined by Union and Company industrial engineers.  The employees were making a killing ($40k per year in the 70's), but all good things come to an end.  The union and company could not settle on productions standards for bonuses and the company scrapped the entire program.  Instead of working harder to be borderline rich, the union blew it.  A messy strike ensued in 1982.  The employees eventually came back to work at two dollars less per hour.  The reason they lost is that they had nothing to bargain with.  Technology had made the jobs simple enough to be learned in less than a week.  People were not afaid to be scabs.  Labor laws essentially took the place of what unions did early on -- protect young workers, provide a safe work environment (osha), and limit hours worked in a day (8 hour work day). What can the union possibly do for the worker other than collect dues?
As everyone has already mentioned, Berkman and Goldman were considered radicals because of there far out beliefs and attempted murder, which actually hurt the union becuase it drew bad publicity from the public instead of symapathy.
I think the homestead strike of 1892 put in concrete what everyone already knew -- the government would back big business and the workers had nothing to hold over the employers (such as special skills).

===message:Since all "Americans" are made up of immigrants, the majority viewed the Unions as almostlike "Big Brother"; for example, if the Union decided on a strike, all employees would be forced to strike, even if they disagreed. In contrast, Berkman and Goldman viewed the rich companies as a dictator so, in turn, rebelled against "Corporations" hence, Frick as the representative.  Remembering just a little over a decade earlier, over 700,000 members of the Knights of Labor viewed consumer boycott over striking.  America has always been a country where people are free to state their opinions and in most cases, a large voice is heard to some degree.  However, Americans will not stand for insurrection no matter what the motive is.  As was evident with Berkman and Goldman, personal vendetta(sp?)executed in the wrong manner will not be very productive.   There is more than one way to skin a cat; anarchy is not one of them.

===message:Many Americans have felt the economic burdens of various unions actions. Whether they support the causes of  union's or not many people have at one time or another had to deal with the consequences of a strike called by a union in their personnal business. Also many employees do not approve of all the actions taken by unions. Especially with the various uses of union dues that not all employees agree with.

Like all anarchists Berkman and Goldmen were opposed to all forms of government and coporate control. They believed in complete individual freedom. They proved their extreme dislike of government and coporations by their actions in Homestead and in the Soviet Union which lead to their eventual exile to France. What made them radical anarchists was the belief that the assassination of Frick was not only necessary for the "producers" to gain control of their livelihood but was also morally justifiable.

The Homestead Strike may have helped to reveal to the American publc that labor reform is necessary through a national press. However, the actions of radicals like Berkman refocused the attention and brought the workers into a bad light. Ultimately the strike did nothing to help the workers at Carnegie Steel Works.

===message:Americans are opposed because some supporters of Unions are violent in nature.  Also, many unions fail to truly stand up to the ideals or primary goals they start out trying to uphold. Some Unions leaders give in to pressure from the Employers and become corrupt.  That does gender trust from Union members.  I also think Americans are selfish and only want to make things better for themselves individually –not as a group.
<br>
I think Berkman and Goldman were viewed as radicals because they were both Russian immigrants and held to extreme beliefs as to how big business and the world in general should operate. Goldman advocated free love and women’s rights at a time when it was considered that “women’s place is in the home”.  Berkman was radical in that he killed a man for a cause that he believed in by himself.  He was not really a part of the Homestead group, but imagined –wrongly- that he was killing for them.  That’s why the workingmen almost beat him to death after he shot Frick.  
<br>
I don’t think the Homestead strike accomplished very much other than to firmly establish that Big Bosses have to power to do whatever they want or pay whatever wage simply because the masses MUST work. This is still evident in that employees are generally expected to give 2 weeks notice before leaving a job (or risk a bad recommendation), and conversely, an employee will lay off or fire employees with absolutely no notice. This is not a rare occurrence and is still unfair to employees, but widely practiced.  Younger employees no longer feel the same loyalty to companies that previous generations felt and will often change jobs with little or no notice, treating the company as they have been treated.

===message:Like any  large business, they try to offer as many benefits as possible to keep from having these Unions and all the problems that arise from them.  For example, out of lets say the ten top Airlines in the US, most of them have unions and constantly are causing the passangers and the airlines additional expense every time they go on strike, many of us have to delay or cancell travel plans because of this, in the other hand Delta, does not have a Union and encourages their employees by being the highest paying airline in the US.  Yes, I believe that some times depending on the employers, it is better to have a union that represents the wellbeing of the employee, but at what expense, if the demands are unreasonable and the company can't afford the requirements of the Union, then there is not job for anyone.
The Homestead Strike did not, in my opinion accomplish any of the proposed goals it set out to accomplish.  Workers kept working without a union.

===message:I am not sure why most Americans are anti-union, but I know why I do not believe that they are in the best interest of our country now.  In the past, before many of our labor laws, unions served a very important purpose.  They helped to ensure the rights of employees, and make sure that not only did the rich get richer, but a little of the money trickled down to the little guy.  Now, our country is chock full of labor laws and government agencies that ensure most employees are taken care of.  Unions force up pay and perks until many companies can no longer compete and are forced to close.  People are opposed to unions because they are a strong arm tactic that doesn't always look out for the best interest of the employee, but for the union.  Berkman and Goldman were seen as radicals because basically the strike had nothing to do with them personally, but they were so opposed to it that Berkman tried to murder Frick and then was willing to die for the cause.  They felt that the workers should "brook no interference", "fight all obstacles" and "conquer more than his original demands".  I do not think the people of this time felt this passionatley about the stike and saw the no holds barred tactics by Berkman and Goldmand as racical.  I think the homestead strike of 1892 was empowering for employers.  It showed that workers could not always hold a company for hostage and that there were ways to fight back.  I think it set the stage for workers to be wary of threatening to strike when they are not prepared to do so.

The general attitude towards unions is that they cause separation in the work place. Having worked several different positions and corporations, both with and without unions, and being the daughter of a former union worker, I feel the topic is still a toss up for me. Unions do benefit the worker if the representation is performing in the best interest of the organization. Then again, the corporation suffers because of the higher demands that union workers want. With the growing trend of non-union workers, I believe that the idea of a union will be outdated.

The unions provide a way for these workers to feel like they have a say in their job and they don't have to feel like they are helpless when it comes to their job; however,  big businesses do not like unions and most Americans do not like unions because they are almost intimidating.  Here is a group of individuals who have a lot of power.  They have the power to strike, to rise up as a group and fight for what they want.  This gives a company's union a lot of power, and that can be terrifying for a company and the people that run it as well.  The Homestead Act was a type of reinforcement and reassurance for farmers.  It was land that was guaranteed to them for a "better life."  This gave the farmers a sense of power and a reason to work for a better life, similar to that assurance given by workers' unions.

The unions set its own minimum wage rates which are usually higher than non union rates for the same job.  This causes the overall labor costs to be higher which in turn forces the contractor to have higher bids.  The contractor can lose the job to lower bids, forcing him to lay off workers because there is no work.  Other union policies can cause hardship to the workers such as involuntary strikes.  Berkman and Goldman were seen as radicals, as previously mentioned, because of their activist beliefs and violent actions.

Many jobs don't give you any choice but to join a union, it is a condition of being hired. And Once you are apart of that union you lose most of your freedom. You have to decide everything as a group. Votes take place and if you happen to be apart of the minority you don't get your way. However, being in a union does have its advantages. The power of a group far exceeds the power of any single person. The homestead strike was an example of this. This was when Carnegis steel attemped to replace all of the union workers with non union employees. The union workers joined together to counter this and they would have succeded if it wasn't for the government comming in to protect big business. Even though the strike failed, it showed the power of unions.
