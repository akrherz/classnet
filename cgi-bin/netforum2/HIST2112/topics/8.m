===message:The universal messages that Rockwell believed were for everyone included freedom of speech,worship,freedom from want and from fear.  I don't believe his illustrations undermined these messages, but were limited to his interpretation of these messages.  Remember that at the time Rockwell was painting, civil rights and embracing different cultures was at the infant stage at best.  Most people still envisioned "Americans" as Anglo-Saxon, middle class, which describes the people in Rockwell's paintings.  They were all healthy, middle-class Americans.  I think the only painting that had an African-American was the Freedom of Worship.  Of course, Rockwell failed to include all of the different cultures that made up America at that time.  I think if Rockwell were painting today, he would most definitely include real America.


  Maybe Rockwell was so popular because the social settings, the subjects, and the themes he portrayed were what people idealized about being "American".  I am a great fan of Rockwell, but honestly, it never occured to me that he left out other American cultures.  Good article; eye-opening.

===message:During wartime, propaganda was used to instill a sense of personal menance.   It was used to play on fear, and sought to stir up patriotic hatred for enemies.  Rockwell did this by celebrating American ways, opportunities, and virtues.  His paintings displayed the "All-American" way of life.  For the most part, white, middle class people were the subjects to sell the American dream.  I think Rockwell's depiction did not undermine it's message because he showed how great America was.  He depicted the fair, easy life of dreams coming true.  In reality, though he did omit groups from this ideal.  For the most part, Blacks and foreigners (Chinese, etc.) were not shown as part of American life.  They were left out, I think, ecause there was such controversy surrounding issues within those groups.  But Rockwell did show classic Americana.

I believe that if he were to have painted today that he would also have included ALL of the great people that reside in America today, not just white, middle class america. During this time period, I feel that he did leave out the rest of the American Society.

===message:I think that Rockwell painted the best that America had to offer at that time.  He painted mainly of white middle class Americans.  His works for the most part did not include Blacks,Chinese,etc.  However, I do agree with Kim that the civil rights movement was in the early stages at this time.  I also noticed that in the Freedom of Religion painting that a Black man was included.  
I think that many people could have felt left out due to his choices but I don't think he was underminding the universal message.

===subject:Propaganda & The Four Freedoms
===message:Propaganda was used in two different ways during WWII.  In one way advertisements, paintings, and publications were used to aid the support of the war.  This was done by creating images of the axis powers as ruthless killers or monsters.  Another type of propaganda during the war to get support of the war was creating slogans and phrases for target groups to identify with the war.  The picture of the woman holding her biceps and saying “We can do it!” was strictly to encourage women to join the work force while the men were fighting the war.  Whether artists and writers used propaganda to reveal the evils of the enemy or to gain support of the people back at home together, it was done to generally get support for the war.<br><br>
   The other type of propaganda used was to celebrate American virtues and beliefs.  President Roosevelt desired for the four essential human freedoms for all members of the human race.  We find that Rockwell too supported these freedoms.  His target group which benefited from these freedoms was not every citizen of the U.S.  We can plainly see from Rockwell’s paintings that they incorporated middle-class, white Americans.  All of his paintings reveal what the ideal lifestyle of an American was desired to be.  The pictures show families sitting at a table with a fully cooked meal and also families going to sleep without thought of danger.  This is what Roosevelt felt the entire world should have.  These pictures though show that the “four freedoms” were primarily meant for the white American. <br><br> 
   The major reason that Rockwell did not provide a true representation of Americans in his photos was because true equality had not incorporated the U.S. just yet.  The Civil Rights movement wouldn’t come until the 1960’s, around two decades in the future.  Even though there were legislation for equal opportunities for work and segregation was beginning to lessen, the major concept of an Anglo-Saxon America was still predominate.  All these things basically left African Americans, Mexican Americans, and many other minorities out of Rockwell’s depiction of the four freedoms.  The war though was a starting point for which whites and black would both be needed on the war front, in the factories, and in the industrial part of the nation.  The “Four “Freedoms” would eventually be upheld for all Americans regardless of race, religious belief, or social status.

===message:I believe that Norman Rockwell did undermine the universal message that the "four freedoms" should be included everywhere in the world. I do not believe that was his intention.  During this time in history America was not such a mixed race of society. Even though all races lived here they were not recognized yet.  That is why I think that he created his works based upon what americans dreamed of.  They were mainly white and middle class in his paintings.  They rest of the people did get left out.

===message:The images that Rockwell's pictures portrayed were of the American values held by white, middle-class people.  So the four essential human freedoms were not universal in his pictures.

Propaganda was used in many other ways at this time.  A huge portion was used to support the war by portraying a sense of danger in the homeland.  Also they used pictures to make the women feel the need to keep the home going and step up while the men were away.  They used pictures of children in posters involving the war.(Genius propaganda!!! Children touch our hearts the most!)

But with all of this propaganda, it all seemed to be for the "white" American values.  All other races and classes were left out.

===message:The posters did portray good messages on the four freedoms, but it did leave out about half of the population. Any type of new immigrant was left out of those posters. With experience of advertisement, I know nowadays that it is neccessary for an advertiser to show the different cultures and races in any type of ad. If the ad is not open to all than it will not be read and understood by all. During that time the open mindedness of the American people was still not open enough to see these different faces on the front covers of magazines or billboards or posters. It still was not necessary because Americans were still getting used to the fact that immigrants were just like them eventhough they had a different color of skin or they had a different language or a different culture. I think Norman Rockwell was careful with the public just as advertisers need to be today. Anything that is seen in the public eye has to make a statement, so maybe he should have put the different colored faces and the different cultures in the posters. A good change would have caused more attention but it would have caused more outrage than support.

===message:I believe that Norman Rockwell's paintings depicting the four freedoms undermine the universal message in the sense of who America was actually comprised of.  America's immigrants, America's African-Americans, America's impoverished... none of them were depicted in his paintings; HOWEVER, in associating these freedoms with the people that were able to experience these freedoms, his paintings were probably pretty accurate. His paintings show mainly white, middle-class, conformed families that were like the "Cosby's" of their time.   Many minorities were probably still feeling that their "four freedoms" were not quite as broad as they perhaps were for the white families during this time.   In addition, the paintings show traditions and values that were established mainly by whites, that later became incorporated into the "all-American" standards and way of living.

===message:   The "Four Freedoms" that idealized America are Freedom of speech, worship, economic smarts, and freedom from fear. These freedoms were captured by Norman Rockwell as the standard of America. The pictures however show a narrow view of whom had freedom than what Norman captured in his work. In his art Rockwell tends to capture only white, protestant people as opposed to the more diverse American landscape. Blacks, immigrants, and Catholics are pretty much left out. Rockwell's images tend to undermine the universiality of Roosevelt's message. The four freedoms were meant to encompass all people not just a particular segment.

===message:Yes, I think that Rockwell did leave out people "everywhere in the world" in his depictions.  The pictures themselves are nice but when you sprall the words, Buy War Bonds or Ours...to Fight For, you are clearly promoting America and its issues.  Rockwell's subjects are clearly white, middle or upper class families.  Those who were thought of as having good values at the time.  There were many groups who were left out of his works, the africian americans, the working class, the widows or widowers to name a few.

===message:While it may be true that Norman Rockwell believed that American values were universal human values his artistic presentations does not display a universal group of people. Clearly Rockwell excluded many including African Americans and other races. He was extremely talented and his artistic contributions to illustrate the American freedoms are good...Rockwell depicts the freedoms effectively, but he only paints through rose colored glasses showing the typical American white families benefitting and enjoying the freedoms. Rockwell should have expanded his subjects to include African American families, Indians, Chinese, and many other races in America. It is unfortunate that his subjects are limited to the white families, but during this period of time I suppose that other things such as magazines, movies, etc. generally depicted the same thing. It would have been a refreshing change if an artist would have depicted all people...it would be interesting to see if it would have opened people's eyes to see things more clearly...I wonder if it would have caused any postive effects?

===message:While Rockwell's paintings did paint the portrait of the American ideal, his vision was very narrow-minded.  He saw a vision of a white, mid-to-upper class family that was perfect and did everything perfectly while upholding all of the American values that were so good they were almost unattainable at that point.  He clearly excluded the poor as well as other racial groups.  Rockwell made his vision very clear about what he thought the American ideal was.  Roosevelt's new deal was originally pin pointed at all groups, but still only helped certain groups.

===message:Rockwell’s depictions of the 4 freedoms did undermine Roosevelt’s universal message because his pictures do not portray people “everywhere in the world”.  Rockwell’s view of these 4 freedoms was extremely limited and close-minded.  President Roosevelt’s view also was limited to those people in the “world” that would be a political asset for America.  His non-action in cases where these 4 freedoms were stomped on shows the true nature of his commitment to really fighting for these rights for others.  
<p>
In Freedom of Speech, the while working man is depicted as exercising his free speech at a rally or meeting or some sort, surrounded by people who are white, just like him.  Since no women are shown in this picture, I guess Rockwell felt women did not need Freedom of Speech, since they should be at home taking care of a husband, the house and some kids.
<p>
In Freedom of Worship, white Catholics are pictures as praying at a church service, this does not show “each...according to his conscience” since only one religion is shown.  I am certain that Rockwell was a Catholic, since that is what he chose to draw as representing “America”.
<p>
In Freedom from Want, once again, a middle-class, white family is pictured eating a huge meal with the fixings.  This is probably at some family event and shows some holiday meal that only white people could afford. You definitely do not see the poor, black farmer eating beans, rice and cornbread—the reality for many during this period after the war--- EVER pictured by Rockwell.
<p>
In Freedom from Fear, the “typical” white, middle-class family is again illustrated, this time showing the pure rest the children get because they have no fears and are secure.  This picture is straight out of “Father Knows Best”. 
<p>
In all four pictures, the white people look well-fed, healthy and happy.  Such a farce from the majority of struggling America—the “real” America.  What Rockwell painted is the exact thinking of the majority of white America.  They wanted these 4 freedoms for people just like them, not for ALL of America---just White America.

African-Americans, Native Americans, women, immigrants were still being denied their freedom and rights daily.

===message:Norman Rockwell’s paintings depicted different scenes from everyday American life.  The scenes certainly did not include everybody in the world as President Roosevelt said in his speech.  Nowhere are there African Americans, Asians or Indians.  The pictures represent the working class, young and old people and families.  They were painted at time when Roosevelt was trying to get support for WWII.  Rockwell’s depictions didn’t undercut Roosevelt’s speech at that time because through these paintings, millions of dollars were raised for the war-bond effort.

===message:Rockwell was a strong idealist, which led him, inspired by Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address, to create his "Four Freedoms." They show common people in normal situations in wartime America. "Freedom to Worship," painted in monochrome so as not to accentuate the differences between people, shows many faiths praying in unison. "Freedom from Fear" shows American parents tucking their children safely into bed during the 1940 Battle of Britain. This calls on Americans to be thankful that the war was not fought on their soil. "Freedom of Speech" is Rockwell's depiction of a manual laborer speaking up at a town meeting. Finally, "Freedom from Want" is a hearty Thanksgiving dinner, based on a photograph Rockwell took of his own family.

It appears to only apply to white America and not all nations and peoples. The Americans that Rockwell depicts  are all white Americans that embody the "Four Freedoms" of Speech, Worship, Freedom from want and Freedom from fear.  All non white Americans were left out and so were farmers and poor white Americans.

Mostly President Roosevelt just refused to see the people that didn’t have it because he had these rights and the important people around him had these rights.  Norman Rockwell’s universe consisted of white middle to upper class families.  There aren’t any poor people and there are no people of color.
