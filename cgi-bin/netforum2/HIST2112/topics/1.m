===message:Immigrants have been mistreated as individuals by Americans because they look different, they speak with an accent or in broken English, they have mannerisms that may not be typical of American mannerisms, and they may not exhibit typical American styles of dress or tastes in cuisine.   As members of a social group, immigrants have been discriminated against by Americans because Americans have felt that immigrants have "invaded" their country in vast and overwhelming numbers and many Americans have felt that since the immigrants have chosen to make America their home, they should adapt their lives to the "American Ideal".   Many Americans have felt that immigrants have taken over a large majority of the labor market in America due to their work ethics and cheap labor rates.   Americans have felt that immigrants have only contributed to the already overextensive social welfare problem.   Americans do not welcome immigrants warmly because of America's past involvement and losses suffered as a result, in foreign affairs.   In addition, many Americans have felt that immigrants are entitled to or have received social and economic benefits that even Americans have difficulty receiving.   During the 19th century, the Chinese were particular targets of American oppression and hatred because as America was struggling to survive the Great Depression the Chinese were immigrating to America in large numbers, taking all of the few available jobs that were available at that time from the Americans because of their willingness to work for such little pay while enduring longer and more toiling work hours.

===message:I agree with the reply that Jade made. I believe that "Americans" feel threatened by immigrants.  They are willing to work as poorly paid wage laborers.  Alot of "Americans" feel that if they are to become "Americans" then they should be treated as such. Taxes, language, welfare restrictions, etc. Throughout history, immigrants were considered genetically inferior. Thus producing the Immigration Act of 1924 and The Chinese Exclusion Acts of 1882 and 1902. The acts were passes basically on the concepts of eugenics, hoping to breed a better human species. They are pretty much a threat to us because we have become, what I consider, a lazy society. Immigrants will work harder, longer, and for lower wages. So the question remains. How do you combine the two cultures?

===message:<p>Immigrants in the past and even today in the United States have been mistreated for many different reasons.  One reason why immigrants might not be welcomed is because of the different customs that also accompanies them.  Different practices of religion, socialization and even language set them apart from the majority of the American population during the 19th century.  Another reason why immigrants might be discriminated against is purely racist thoughts.  Even after slavery became illegal worldwide, this did not instantaneous change people’s feelings towards other races.  This one cause for mistreatment has been a problem for centuries and is still a problem today.</p>  
   <p>In general Americans do not welcome change with open arms.  Thus when masses of new cultural and people groups come over to the United States, there presence is usually looked down upon with fear, question, and even hate.  In the past this has been a major problem, such as with the Chinese in the 1880’s and for Japanese American’s during WWII.  When there have been harsh times in the US, being either economical instability, during periods of war, or threats towards national security, American’s have either generally accepted or denounced the immigrant’s presence in the country.</p>  
   <p>The Chinese were particular targets of American discrimination during a period of economic dismay and scarcity of work in the United States.  Over 300,000 Chinese came to the US between 1850 and 1882.  During the depression era in the 19th century, the Chinese who would work for less, led to more white American’s being jobless.  Even though it wasn’t a valid argument, that the shortage of jobs came from the presence of Chinese in the nation, many American’s blamed the Chinese for the job shortages.  There were hostile feelings during this time, while anti-Chinese mobs destroyed Chinese businesses and homes.  To respond with the problems Congress created the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned any more immigration from China.  This time of economic uncertainty wasn’t fair to the Chinese people, but when there are problems within a nation, it is easy to point the finger and blame others for reasons of the crisis.</p>

===subject:Discrimination and Hatred
===message:

Immigrants have been harshly treated and discriminated against essentially since the founding of America. I believe that tradition has a large part of the responsibility for the continued discrimination today, but in the beginning I believe that there were several factors contributing to the unwelcome attidue toward the immigrants. First, I believe that a lot of the American citizens felt resentment towards the immigrants because they felt that they were essentially competition...not only would they be competing against other Americans for jobs, but now they would be running against immigrants who would gladly accept lower wages and longer hours. Also, Americans didn't understand the cultural differences that the immigrants possessed. They didn't understand their way of life, their religion, traditions, etc. and the Americans didn't really want to learn or accept anything about the immigrants except for the fact that they were different. Most immigrants were entering America the same way they left their old country behind...with not much money or material things, but clinging to the dream of a better life. However, once the immigrants entered the country they were generally met with hatred and cruel opposition because the immigrants did not instantly assimilate into the American culture. I believe that immigrants clinged to their traditional home culture because it was the only way that they knew. I think that a lot of Americans shunned the immigrants and didn't welcome them thus the immigrants began to retreat to the only comfortable way of life they knew. Different groups of immigrants have all suffered through the discrimination and hatred, but the Chinese were a selected target during the 19th century. The Chinese found themselves working for America and filling the positions of many jobs such as the dangerous railroad jobs. After reading "Nothing Like it in the World" by Stephen Ambrose I was amazed at the unbearable conditions that the Chinese and Irish men endured. Many of the men were buried alive in the snow while working to build the first transcontinential railroad from Nebraska to California during 1863-1869 for America. These men were working to build a railroad which would benefit the country, but they were treated so inhumane. These groups of immigrants such as the Chinese were forced to establish their own exclusive idenities and groups such as the many Chinatowns that were formed. And yet we wonder why they just don't fit in...why would they want to when they have been treated so harshly? I think that the American citizens that feel so angry towards the immigrants should consider what their contributions to the country have been such as the Chinese who completed the first railroad. Tradition has been passed down through the years...the hatred towards the immigrants, fear of competition with jobs, and not understanding their way of life thus continuing patterns of discrimination against immigrants.  I do not agree with the hatred and immigration and feel that citizens should consider the immigrants contributions and dream of a better life. However, I do feel that all immigrants that have entered the country or will in the future enter the country should have to consider the price that has been paid for the freedom to freely enter America. Many Americans and their family members have given their lives so that American citizens and immigrants can enjoy the freedoms that are freely given and enjoyed and have given many immigrants the hope of a better life.

===message:Upon arrival to America, the sole purpose of the Chinese immigrants was to serve as cheap labor during the explosion of the international labor market.  Most arrived poor, uneducated, and lacking a bridging skill to accommodate their migration to America.  As such, there were considered an inferior race of people and did not pose as a threat to white Americans.  The Chinese laboring for cheap and working long hours forced Americans to realize that what they once thought would be cheap and advantageous labor, turned out to be a very costly market.  Due to a steady Chinese immigration flow, the continuous increase of unemployment amongst Europeans and white Americans, and the very threat of their livelihood, provoked the mistreatment and discriminating behavior against the Chinese.


In addition, when the Chinese migrated to American they brought with them their traditions and lifestyles, which included the habit of smoking opium.  At first Americans paid no attention to the then legal consumption of opium and just about any other drug.  The Chinese often stayed away from what would be considered a very racist America and secluded themselves from Americans with the exception of work interaction.  Soon, curious young white men began to frequent the Chinese opium smoking parlors, which did not bring cause for alarm.  However, opium mixed with addictive enhancers had created an opium addict population consisting predominantly of middle and upper class white middle-aged women.  This event in itself caused outrage amongst white Americans to only further discriminate and mistreat the Chinese.

It seems reasonable to assume that anyone will at times "loose-it" mentally, and unfairly blame other people for their own sufferings when faced with bad times. There was a terrible downturn of the economy during those times, and the railroad labor was no longer needed, either. Lotsa folks outa work in the city. It was not the wealthy folk who despised the "Chinaman"...rather, it was the lower class worker who hated the "coolie". Admittedly, prejudice does exist, but this thing was economically driven from the get-go! This situation made it so ripe for ol' Denis Kearney and the boys to do so well for the Workingman's party in California. What did they say?...A meat-eater can't work as cheaply as a rice-eater. Granted, there are cultural hatreds, but this was money talking.

You know,...I don't mind orderly, legal immigration, at all, but I cannot stand deliberate illegal influx. How many times I have legally arrested (or cited) a person for anything from a simple traffic offense to a more serious infraction, only to find that the person was in the United States illegally.

Even though America is a melting pot of various peoples, the white, anglo-saxon people had a stronger influence in tone and ideals.  It is part of human nature to fear the unknown or unfamiliar.  I believe that is why immigrants have been mistreated or discriminated, just as the Native Americans were;of course, as has been stated by other members of the class, it is all about money.  The more immigrants working for less pay, the less jobs available for the true "Americans?"  I believe that the Chinese people were sooo different from what Americans had become that they were feared the most by the working class; get rid of what we can't explain or don't understand.

Unfortunately, Americans are sometimes ignorant to new cultures and traditions that are brought from the immigrants, and most don't understand the reason for them coming here. Most immigrants came because their country was or is going through hard times because of the economy. Just like the Puritans when they came to America on the Mayflower, they were looking for a better opportunity. In addition, what really shocks me is the fact that eventhough the Puritans came to America for freedom they actually put restrictions on people because of their difference of religion. The Puritans pushed the freedom of the Indians away and eventually a little ways down the road into reservations. Is that fair? We should be speaking some sort of Indian language, if you think about it. The Chinese came to this country for the same reason that the Puritans came. They came and actually helped Americans out by quick building for low pay. It's sad but true that Americans are spoiled, if they can't have it their way than its no way. For that reason we are a democracy and for that reason we are the strongest country in the world. We impose ourselves with confidence and power against the other countries.

===message:As previously stated, I think immigrants are discriminated against because they are different, but many immigrants add to the feelings of prejudice by choosing to speak in their language to each other because the American will not understand it.  This is rude & inconsiderate.  As a social group, immigrants cling to their culture rather than adapt to the "American way".  The high rate of illegitimate births, adultery, pre-martial sex, & abortions attest to the fact that America generally has lower moral standards than some countries.  Those things are common & accepted in general in the U.S.  Many immigrants wisely choose to maintain their high standards in such areas while peacefully living in America, trying to earn an honest living. 
<br>
I feel Americans do not welcome immigrants because they take jobs away from Americans who cannot live off minimum wage. Immigrants are willing to work for that or less.  Due to the high level of poverty & danger in many of their homelands, immigrants are just happy to be safe, not worried about dying in a battle between warring factions, being raped, tortured, or made to join an army of dissidents & forced to kill others.  Many immigrants are here illegally & unscrupulous Americans benefit, as in the past with the railroads & highways, by paying a low wage or in cash, under the table. 
<br>
The Chinese were targets of hatred in the 1870s because Americans were in a depressed economic state & vented their anger on the Chinese. The politicians, such as Denis Kearny, used that hatred as fuel for campaign promises. Since the Chinese had no spokesman, unfounded beliefs & rumors about the Chinese persisted & became accepted fact. The Chinese Exclusion Act was unconstitutional but is no different from the later “Separate but equal” Jim Crow laws against African Americans. In the 1960s, we lost lives & had to claw for every “right” we have. Though many Americans are descendants of immigrants, nothing has really changed in over 200 years : Americans don’t really want to share the land of the “free”. They have been forced to do so, to an extent, & resent it.

They discriminated against immigrants because they too were eager to begin a new life... but in American and not their own countries.  Americans had a wonderful way to treat those they were used to, but as soon as someone different was thrown into the "melting pot," they turned up their noses and pushed away.
<br>
Unfortunately, the problem continues today for the most part.  Americans are people of habit.  It is often difficult for us to adapt to drastic changes in our routine and surroundings.  With the flood of immigrants in the early stages of America's development, things were becoming too different at a crucial developing period in those American's lives.  They wanted to live their lives, their way.
The Chinese became a true target of the American's discrimination because the Chinese were willing to work for whatever someone could give them.  They didn't require a large salary (like that many had heard of receiving in America) and they didn't really care about what kind of job it was.  This took away from the job market that the white Americans had and that bothered them terribly.  I can only assume that those Americans (and possibly some Americans today) think that by persecuting people they don't want here, that will send them back to where they came from.  This is a horrible attitude on our part.  A good point was brought up though... this IS an English speaking country.  Shouldn't everyone speak English?  Shouldn't English be THE primary language known by all in this country?  Working in retail, I find it more and more evident that those in this country don't always know English very well at all.

When the immigrants arrived and were forced to live in tenement housing in the poorest sections of town, Americans labeled them as anti-social.  In reality, they worked long, hard hours for meager wages, spending what little time they had left with their families.  When the Chinese arrived, many Americans were afraid that their jobs were being taken away and filled by these immigrants who worked for low wages.  Americans also did not like the Chinese culture and the fact that they stayed within their own section of town.  Additionally, since the Chinese chose not to argue with Americans or have a spokesperson to speak up for their inequalities, they were often ridiculed.

===message:I believe that some people view any incoming immigrant as a threat to America's future.  An immigrant may come to America seeking a job-- a job that an American may view as theirs, since they are originally from this country.  Americans tend to be afraid of change and afraid of someone taking away their choices and their opportunities that were handed to them.

===message:Immigrants have been treated badly and discriminated against as members of a social group for different reasons. For the most part Americans had it in there mind what a typical American should look like, and how they should act. When the immigrants arrived and were forced to live in tenement housing in the poorest sections of town, Americans labeled them as anti-social. In reality, they worked long, hard hours for meager wages, spending what little time they had left with their families. When the Chinese arrived, many Americans were afraid that their jobs were being taken away and filled by these immigrants who worked for low wages. Most Americans demean immigrants because they are willing to do the jobs most Americans don’t want to do,  but Americans see that as taking our jobs instead of taking the jobs most of us wouldn’t want.

===message: There are many reason as to why immigrants are mistreated. One reason why they are mistreated is because Americans felt threated by them. They felt that the Chinese would take jobs away from hard-working American families, because they worked excessive hours for very low wages. Americans also didn't like the presence of the Chinese people because of preconceived notions that might have been held about them. Another reason the Chinese were mistreated is because they had no political representation. In closing, I feel that Americans were very insensitive in their treatment of the Chinese.
