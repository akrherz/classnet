===message:I agree with you Linda on the motives behind America’s push for some policies and actions taken in the past.  After reading the text we can plainly see that the annexation of the Philippines was a strategic move that would provide economic power and naval strength in the Pacific Ocean.  On page 583 in our text book Senator Beveridge stated, “We will establish trading posts throughout the world as distributing points for American products.”  It seems like this man's feeling and even perhaps the entire view of congress and our nation was to become a leading nation in international trade.  During this time period, we did make a push for recognition as a world leader in power and economic stability.  I can see where Mark Twain came from by disagreeing with the situation over the Philippines.  We did not care about the independence or freedom of the islanders, but desired a position in the Pacific.  The motives behind annexing the Philippines and even Hawaii were purely for economic gain and American interests.
