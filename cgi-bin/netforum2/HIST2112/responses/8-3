===message:I very much agree with your posting.  This was a time of inequality amongst many races.  The "white" values were considered the superior values at this time.  But like you said, If the portraits were painted today, you would see the true American values and equality for all.

===message:I agree with you that Rockwell left out the "rest of American Society".  I have asked myself "Why" for many years now and it finally dawned on me that he was PAID for his paintings and illustrations.  If he drew American society as it really was, he would not have made the huge fortune that he did and would not have been popular at all--at least not to white people....and they run the world.
