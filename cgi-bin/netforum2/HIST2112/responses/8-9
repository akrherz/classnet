===message:That is a unique way of looking at the situation.  Emphasizing the two views the way that you did, made me think of it in the same ways that you did.  
Thanks for your comments, it helped me to think of it in a different light.

===message:Nice way of analyzing the situation, relating it to the way society thought during this time period.  It would be true if you look at Rockwell’s paintings from the perspective of the “Ideal American Society” at this time, society was thought to be primarily white Americans.  Considering these thoughts, Rockwell did undermine the universal message of the four freedoms.<br><br>
   Contrasting the fact that America did not only account for white citizens make his depiction of society wrong though.  We know that a majority of Americans at the time were immigrants, African Americans and Mexican Americans.  The issue though is that these individuals weren’t generally looked upon as equal Americans.<br><br>  
   The four freedoms were ideally for all Americans but we know that this wasn’t an accurate statement and wouldn’t be for some years until after the Civil Rights Movement.

===message:I agree with Jade, Rockwell's paintings depicted the "Americans lifestyle" from a narrow perspective, but I think it was a universal dream of most Americans. I think the fact that all his characters looked- alike showed the pervailing mentality of the government, because there were too many Americans who did not share in these freedoms and the government did nothing to correct it.
