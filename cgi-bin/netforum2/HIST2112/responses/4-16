===message:Idealistically, it is "wrong" to treat, or even think of, someone as inferior; however, it is simply human nature to do so.  Different does not always mean better, but realistically, there just are some things and methods that are better than others.  Think of the Phillipines today.  Is it any better today than it was then?  How much further has American society advanced than the Phillipino society?  I would say a great deal.  Is our society better or just different.  I think most of the world would agree that American civilization is better.  I agree with your depiction of the photo, i.e. the white man carrying what looked to me like a foreign person, struggling to make it up a steep hill, all the while carrying the other so that he too may reap the knowledge.  Yes, certainly, people in the way got discarded, but in reality, do those who hang on to things past not get discarded.  Even with technological advances, many are left behind and do not progress as those who strive to keep up with the world around them.
