===message:I have to agree with you on one point especially.   I used to live in Orlando Florida and at our church we had a large Hispanic ministry.  When the church had picnics etc, it seemed that the hispanic members of our church didn't want to comingle with the white members.  They would set up their chairs and food stuff separate from the rest of us.  If we had a holy day, the church had bilingual masses which would have one reading in English and one in Spanish.  This kind of pacified some but didn't serve either side and especially the non hispanic members.  Most of the Spanish speaking members spoke or understood spoken English.  So, those of us who don't know spanish missed out on a reading while the hispanic members got to hear both in languages they could understand.  I am feeling forced to learn spanish b/c so many people here speak it and so many jobs seem to require bilingual speakers.  But as the previous message stated:  This is an English speaking country.  Why can't we all speak English?
I don't know whether this was a factor for the Chinese but my understanding is that they kept to themselves and as we know there are Chinatowns all over the country in big cities.  I've been to Chinatown in Seattle and San Franscisco and New York and it is like being in China- rarely does anyone speak English unless they are hawking their goods at the tourists.

===message:Amy, that is sad that the Hispanics seperated themselves at church. It should not be that way, everyone should be united, especially if they share the same religious beliefs. In my religion, we do not have such separations and we are worldwide.  I, like you, am also learning Spanish due to how common it is in the United States and I've seen the ads requiring it for a job, and not a job as an interpreter. It is forecasted that Spanish will become the #1 language spoken in American within this century, and we were not even a Spanish colony. As for Chinatowns, true, true.  I got lost in New York there and store owners were angry that I did not know a single Chinese word and would not help me find my way.  An obviously Chinese-american girl, who spoke both languages, helped me get home.  Our country has not only allowed huge numbers of immigrants in, but have not even tried to require that they learn OUR language.  In most instances, the only truly universal language is MONEY.

===message:I agree with the first responder,  immigrants were discriminated against and not welcomed because they were different, they spoke a different language, they walked and dressed differently, and they were eager to work for meager wages that were beneath americans.  As a result they monopolize a large market of jobs and opportunities that americans could have had.  "300,000  chinese  came  between the 1850-1882, this  was a particularly large number of people invading the job market, as a result americans were furious and hostile towards the chinese and pressured congress to pass the chinese exclusion act..

===message:I would like to respond to your comment about the low morality that Americans share.  Do you beleive that only "Americans" have illegitimate pregnancies, or have abortions, or take durgs in the United States? It is my opinion because we are so open to immigrants that our statistics in these areas are so high. Look at the number of violent gang memebers in Los Angeles and other large cities that are Asian or Hispanic.  To say that our morals are not as high as other countries is not fair because America is a representation of all countries. 

Poverty in this country is not anything like poverty in other countries especially Asia.  Immigrants can come to this country and be fed and live in a clean apartment or have a brand new house built for them because of federally funded programs and private donations that are given be Americans.  In Thailand poverty is drinking water out of the same river that you took your Sunday bath in, and dinner is the same every night if you have dinner.  There is not public assistance.  So why not come to America where you can work for minimum wage have six, eight or ten children, and still have food to eat and a roof over your head.  This is why so many immigrants in years past and today are discriminated aganist.  We as a society expect to certain things, that does not make us spoiled, but a prosperous country.

===message:B Kornegay,
I do not see immigrants as being rude because they choose to speak in their native tongue.  They are simply speaking in the language they feel most comfortable using.  It is not necessary for immigrants to lose themselves in American culture and forget about their own culture.  It is possible to take advantage of all the diverse cultures in America and learn from them.  That is part of what makes America so great.
