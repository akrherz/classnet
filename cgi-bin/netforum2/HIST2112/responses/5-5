===message:Wesley Evan's incorporation of religion in his justification of racial stereotypes and injustices is a perfect example of how many people, throughout history and even today, can interpret, modify, or perceive the Bible or other religious principles in various ways, or in support of their particular cause or motives.

===message:As you said, the whole article was contradictory.  He wrote as if he were educated, but I believe he didn't have both arms in his poncho(sp?).  Like the one reply to your comment said, unfortunately some people who profess Christianity do not have a clue what it stands for.  Thanks for your insight.

Evans' used as you said his "low-mentality" in everything he did...his sterotypes of other religions and races was unconceivable.  It is virtually impossible to imagine possessing the type of thinking that he had...feeling that he was superior among the races and that he had some sort of right, duty to reserve America just for what he considered to be "true Americans" It is very frustrating to see people like him attempt to offer the idea that his beliefs are incorporated with the Christian faith. I enjoyed your posting on the subject...Evans was quite clearly one crazy guy!

===message:I'm a little bit torn on this one.  I do not really think that Evans was crazy or used "low-mentality".  Like I posted previously.  He used his words in a way that convinced a great deal of followers. If you think about some of the aspects in his speech, it can be closely compared to our pledge.  One nation, Under God, Indivisible..... I think these were the points he was trying to discuss.  He did not believe that certain groups could remain "Indivisible" or Uphold all American ideals because they had their own heritage/culture/background.  Once again, I'm not stating that his views are correct. I'm just stating that I do indeed think that he was an educated man who felt very strong for American ideals.

===message:I agree with your view of Evans and his speech.  While he did not ever acknowledge that his goal was to try to “hold onto his ethnic pride, culture, & religion”, his means of trying to do this were so backward and wrong.  He may have wanted to live a “free and prosperous life here in America” but he did not want anyone else of the “wrong race” to have that same right.  It is because he was this selfish and intolerant of others that his cause and his organization, the KKK, failed miserably.

===message:I suppose I selected the wrong choice of words when I selected crazy, but I guess that is the first word that came to mind when I read Evans' speech and his thoughts concerning different views and races. I agree with you I do think that Evans' was an educated individual and I do believe that he was persuasive gaining many followers. However, he used his power in the most negative way. Although he was educated I do feel that his thoughts reflect a low mentality of thinking that his race reigned supreme...it's just so hard to understand his thoughts. I guess my emotion triggers me to feel that he is a crazy man to think that he is the ultimate race and denounces all others. I understand your sentiments that his thoughts reflected our pledge, but Evans' pledge definately did not believe in liberty and justice for all people...just his own.

I think I made a mistake and typed the subject line "reply to Connie" but I meant "reply to Linda" so I am sending the reply again.
Anyway, I enjoyed your posting Linda!
