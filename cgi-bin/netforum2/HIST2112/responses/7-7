===message:I agree with Veroncia, the pain that you can read in the woman's face is hard to express, and impossible for us to relate to.  I like the analogy Veronica made with the emptu plate and it reprsenting emptiness not only in their stomachs, but also in their lives.  The Government was doing what it does best, and putting a positive spin to a terrible time.

===message:Veronica, I never even noticed that empty plate.  I read your reply and reviewed the picture.  I agree that it well represents “a period of great need and hardships”.  During the Great Depression, this is what the majority of Americans experienced.  It seemed unbelievable after all the prosperity of the 1920s.  My grandmother would talk of that time and how hard it was for a poor, rural black family trying to work a farm. She said they ate almost anything and learned how to search the wood for things that could be eaten. Many Black farmers started out in debt, trying to farm in poor soil with bad farm equipment and were hit extremely hard during the Great Depression.  They had to deal with being poor and with being discriminated against.

===message:I agree that what is pictured in Lange’s photo is hard for us to relate to because most Americans in our generation have always had food, clothing and shelter, plus most of our frivilous "wants". We are a very spoiled society of people, which is why many nations despise us. Also, it is true that the government was trying to “put a positive spin to a terrible time”.  That is so funny! Those pictures from the Visalia camp look so phony; the people are not even smiling while they are playing card games or while dancing.  And, like in our times, whatever spin the government puts out is what is recorded in the history books.

===message:I'm sure this was a very hard time for black families.  The little things that they did have were taken away with the arrival of the depression.  What a truly sad time in history for many.
