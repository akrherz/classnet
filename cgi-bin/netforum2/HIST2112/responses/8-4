===message:Yes! I think "undermining" is a strong word.  Ignorance was probably closer to the reason Rockwell would leave out different cultures. Thanks for your comment.

Rockwell Could Not have been ignorant of different cultures.  Anyone growing up in America was surrounded by them every day.  I think Rockwell was just smart enough to want to get money for his illustrations and the glam and glory that went along with being popular among rich and middle-class Caucasians.
