===message:Hey Veronica.  I like your statement that said our society is a "lazy" one.  In America, many people have grown accustomed at work by performing with least amount of effort and expecting the same results.  Another way to state this is that some people work just to get by.  With immigrants though, they work hard and well no matter what the job is.  There isn't room for being lazy with some of the jobs immigrants perform.  One reason for this is that the employees can always find someone else who is willing to work the same amount of stressful and difficult work, for the same wages, if not lower.  In this regard, the American population definitely would look down upon immigrants.  These people who come from overseas will work for less and work harder for low wages.  This diminishes the available jobs for other Americans and brings down the wages that we are willing to work for.  The other reason why Americans don’t generally accept immigrants have to do with cultural, social, and even their religious beliefs, but one of the major ones is how they contribute to the job market.  This isn’t necessarily bad, because from another point of view, they bring to the United States better work ethics and more discipline on the job.  These are the things that should always be considered, but are not, when people discriminate against immigrants

===message:I suppose that I would fall into the category of Americans that feel that immigrants should be subjected to the treatment of being a full-fledged American(taxes, welfare restrictions, etc.) I do strongly feel that immigrants should be informed of the country's history and the price that was paid for the freedom that they are enjoying. I know that the immigrants dream is to come to America for a better life...to the land of freedom. I think that the immigrants should be fully entitled to these freedoms   and should not be subjected to the terrible hatred and discrimination they have encountered. I do feel that the immigrants should embrace, respect, and be aware of the price that men and women have paid for those freedoms. I do agree with you a lot of the immigrants do work longer hours and for much less pay than the traditional American citizen because the immigrant has endured a harsh, poor life in their home country so low wages and long hours seem like a dream job to the one in their past life. However, I don't think that you can call us a lazy society for this. In any society I think that you will have those people who have no desire or drive to work or to better themselves, but I do not feel that it makes us a lazy society as a whole.

===message:I'm not saying that every American is lazy.  I am saying that Americans see immigrants as a threat due to their ability to endure a lower standard of the job force.  But if you watch the news for about 10 minutes, you can see what a society we have become.  Welfare rates of steadily increasing, Unemployment rates,etc.  Not all Americans, but several depend upon the government for financial support.  I believe that some people do need help, but everyone knows how much welfare abuse is going on. I don't like the idea of discrimination, but I do have some resentment for special privilages given to those who are capable of supporting themselves.  I have to pay taxes, A precentage of my check goes to welfare. I could use the money just as much as them.

===message:I don't know that I would call Americans lazy.  It is a known fact that Americans put in more hours at work than in any other country in the world.  Americans have evolved tremendously over the last two centuries, which has created a certain level of tolerance, or non-tolerance for low paying wages.  Therefore, when immigrants come to this country, then and now, they work diligently for severely low paying positions that Americans will not accept.  As a direct result, Americans lose the opportunity for employment increasing the American poverty level and unemployment rate.  In my opinion, immigrants are not a threat to Americans; Americans are a threat to Americans.

In addition, I think this is part of the problem in American culture.  Many believe that we are supposed to mesh, mix and live together.  Since there are so many cultures that reside in America, by human nature and sever diversities, it is not feasible to always co-exist.  It is not mandatory and it won't bring harm to any one individual or group so long as civility and laws are respected.  Differences are what make this country so unique.  If we just accept the differences in other cultures, there would be no need to ask, "How do we combine cultures?"

===message:Actually, welfare rates have dropped tremendously over the last 5 years due to welfare reform.  This is a fact.  It is very difficult to abuse the welfare system these days because of the drastic changes that took place during the Clinton administration.  It is not made an easy task for Americans and immigrants alike to receive governmental assistance if it is not needed.  Some need the assistance and cannot get it for one reason or another.  There is a lot of footwork involved.  In addition, the unemployment rates have increased because of a slumping economy, which will eventually turn itself around.  And yes, Americans do have to pay taxes some of which goes to welfare recipients who happen to be immigrants.  We also enjoy simple luxuries that we take for granted such as a driver’s license and practically free education with scholarships and grants, which many if not all immigrants who first come to American cannot afford.  We also have the ability to purchase anything from homes to cars that an immigrant cannot do without simplcities like a social security card and income tax returns.  And what special privileges are you talking about?  Can you please specify?  In my opinion, there is no special privileges that can possibly out weight the benefits of being a full fledged American citizen.  American citizens can never be deported.  We are here for life if we so chose to be.

===message:I agree with you on the welfare rates. Yes, they did infact decline. But why did they decline? Not because people wanted to better themselves. They declined because restrictions were place upon them and they had to change.

The part I find most unfair with welfare is the fact that the people who have actually worked their entire lives cannot receive medication coverage and their social security benefits are taken away by high monthly premiums. But with Medicaid, medication, dental cleanings, etc. are covered. Why should our elderly go without essential medications while the other non-working class are getting their teeth cleaned for free??

There are numerous scholarships and grants that are out their for immigrants/minorities.  Look at our medical field. How many doctors are of a different nationality?  Another privelage is the "Affirmitave Action" program.  This program is there to help immigrants receive a job over a more qualified individual due to the fact that they are a minority.

The part you said about drivers liscense and homes.  I see people of different nationalities driving every day. ( And I must say they park their very nice cars in the driveway of a very nice house.) So I am a little bit confused on that one.  My soon to be brother-in-law is an immigrant and he drives a lexus and owns a home in Eagles Landing and received grants, loans, and scholarships, to become a very successful doctor.

My previous posting was not meant in any way to offend anyone.  I was simply pointing out why Americans would treat immigrants differently.  Any special treatment given to one will cause hostility in another.  It happens everyday. So with all this discussion about Welfare, I really feel that we have strayed from the original question.

from the original questions about past Chinese immigrants.  Not what all has become today.  The questions was about the Chinese in the 19th century and why Americans didnt welcome them then.  I think  for the most part they were mistreated due to inferiority, their culture and their willingness to work hard.
