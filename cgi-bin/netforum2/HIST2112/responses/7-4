The devastation is definately displayed in the photographs that we viewed. I looked at the picture of the mother with her children in a new light after reading your posting...I thought the point that you made about the children looking to the mother for protection was a good one. As you mentioned the fact that the mother felt the responsibility with no hope anywhere. I can't imagine the feelings that the mother experienced feeling she was up against a monster that she would not be able to battle...the helplessness had to make her feel as if she was totally powerless. Thanks for your posting, I enjoyed it.

===message:I agree, the picture of the mother is heart-breaking. As a mother, the ability to provide and protect my child comes above all others.  What torment for a mother not to be able to shelter and feed her children.  The picture of the "Migrant Mother" is truely a piece of art.  You can almost tell what she is thinking and your heart goes out to her.

===message:I agree that the devastation is so evident in the photos of the “Migrant mother” and of the farmer and his sons.  You summed up the way the pictures make me feel very well.  I could almost sense the fatigue in the photos.  You are very right in the latter set of photos of the camps as being like a “government commercial”.  That is funny, but very true.  They were so perfect-looking, that you should know that it was TOO perfect-looking to be reality.  They look very staged, and come to find out, they were!.
