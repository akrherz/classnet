===message:For the most part, I agree. However, I also believe that many people feel threatened by change. If a certain group feels that they are superior and everthing they do is "right" then they are less willing to incorporate other beliefs and cultures into their world. It is like they are trying to preserve what they have created. History has shown that it has taken the ideas of many great people of different nationalities to create this great country.
