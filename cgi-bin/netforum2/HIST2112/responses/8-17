Rockwell was a strong idealist, which led him, inspired by Franklin Roosevelt's 1941 State of the Union Address, to create his "Four Freedoms." They show common people in normal situations in wartime America. "Freedom to Worship," painted in monochrome so as not to accentuate the differences between people, shows many faiths praying in unison. "Freedom from Fear" shows American parents tucking their children safely into bed during the 1940 Battle of Britain. This calls on Americans to be thankful that the war was not fought on their soil. "Freedom of Speech" is Rockwell's depiction of a manual laborer speaking up at a town meeting. Finally, "Freedom from Want" is a hearty Thanksgiving dinner, based on a photograph Rockwell took of his own family.
