===message:It is true that immigrants have been mistreated throughout our history.  American’s tend to pick and choose the bad things and leave out any good qualities that immigrants might bring along.  The one quality that the Chinese incorporated, that the American’s have not acquired at that time, was a lower standard of living, especially during a time where there was depression and low income paying jobs.  The fact that the industrial revolution was underway brought forth many low paying factory jobs.  The rail road industry was also in full motion during this time.  The income from these jobs were not very high, because they work required was a lot of repetitive motions and unskilled labor.  If someone who was not satisfied with the pay left, it was just as easy to hire another individual for that work.  The Chinese during this period of time flocked over to the U.S. and took most of these low paying jobs.  Since there was a job shortage for American’s, they blamed the Chinese for the economic problems in the United States.  It was not the Chinese fault or the American’s fault during this time of economic difficulty.  The problem was that the industrial revolution was taking place, and there was not a need for high skilled workers anymore.  The “wage laborer” was the norm now, and the American population had a difficult time adjusting to this.  Therefore, the Chinese were the best target of blame, because they had a majority of the jobs.

===message:I do not agree that Chinese workers made their money and returned home.  This is evident from the fact that there are 3rd and 4th generation Chinese still living here.  Also, the fact there some many major cities have "Chinatowns" where the entire population is made of Chinese people shows most Chinese chose to endure the discrimination and live a better life here than at home in China.
