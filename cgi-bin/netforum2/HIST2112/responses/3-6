I agree with you, Jade...I liked your illustration of unions being anti-government thus it appears they are anti-Americans. The acts displayed by Berkman & Goldman only added to the union's image of being anti-government, anti-American.

===message:I agree that the majority of American’s are anti-union.  This type of association could append disorder and a weak authority to the corporation's employers.  The Homestead Strike is an example of when this type of situation went to the extreme.  With American’s and our political system, we are all about order and law.  When you take away authority from the employers, the people do have more power to do their will within the company, but this power could also be misused.  There always needs to be some type of authority figure that makes the regulations on behalf of the employees.  When authority is taken away from the government or in this case a corporation, there is not much security.  If the people overuse their power the business or nation could fall.  If the corporation abuses it with unfair job requirements, then the people will usually retaliate.  There does need to be some sort of moderation with what is acceptable in the job place, but the employers and managers should always have the final authority over the company standards.  In summary, unions are generally looked down upon, because they do take away from the authority, which can be seen as “un-American” and also a business without leadership comes uncertainty and instability within the corporation.
