===message:I like what you said in your last paragraph.  Norman Rockwell Dipicted an America at that time in history.  The civil rights movement was not until later and all people of America are recognized now.

===message:Your comments express my views also, just more elequently.  I would have to agree with you that Rockwell could only paint what was currently accepted; his views were soo limited, as were most of white-Americans; it's a shame, too, because I bet he would have done some tremendous paintings that included all Americans.

===message:It is sad that society kept Norman Rockwell from portrayting the full American picture. Today artists are even censored from showing their complete works because of what is seen as right in society. Advertisers have to be careful in every aspect because the public can have different reactions to their works. I am sure that someone in the time of Rockwell had something negative to say about his work.

===message:Yes, I agree.   According to Norman Rockwell's paintings, it seems as though the "four freedoms" was something that was not available to anyone other than whites, which was actually a grim reality at that time.   The people in the paintings are enjoying the activities and traditions that were ideals for "white America" (family holidays, family dinners, mom and dad tucking the children safely into bed, etc.); unfortunately, this was not the "America" that most immigrants and minorities had lived or had even experienced.

===message:I do not agree that the 4 Freedoms have been upheld "for all Americans regardless of race, religious belief, or social status".  Historical facts prove this has not and is not the case.  White Americans still have the most realistic experience of the 4 Freedoms.  Black people are getting pulled over by prejudiced policemen everyday just for "DWB"--Driving While Black.  And most African-Americans know better than to protest because you will get the BEATDOWN by policemen.  Even if it is caught on tape, white justice is blind and the perpetrators of such crimes are acquitted daily...those from the past in the 1960's and today.  Not much changes except the day for minorities.

===message:I do sympathize with your thoughts Kornegay, but please note that I was not expressing <b>absolutely</b> that everyone all the time will always enjoy the four freedoms.  There will always be some individual who is racist and will abuse there police powers or other authority against a minority group.  We aren’t living in a perfect world, nor ever will be.  We are living in an era of Civil Rights though, in which “no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; <i><b>nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</i></b>”  Please note that this is the 14th amendment and all people have rights these days against in justices according to racial discrimination.  Whether or not these individuals exercise these rights in court is up to them.  To my knowledge I have not heard of any of these “beatdowns” lately.  If there are these problems, they must be few and sparse otherwise the media would surely focus on them.  I also feel that today generally “most” but not all Americans have the opportunity to experience the four freedoms.  Please note that yes, I do agree that back before WWII when Rockwell’s painting were published, the four freedoms were only focused on white Americans. <br><br>  Is there injustice in our society?  Yes.  Are there issues of racial inequality?  Of course.  Does this mean that because of these issues that the four freedoms aren’t upheld for minority groups and African Americans?  Absolutely not.  Your two examples against my statements are solely on the speculation of blacks having an ill appropriate accusation by a policeman.  I doubt that this one case entitles that nothing has changed since the Civil Rights movement.  These are cases of racial issues, not the four freedoms.  The four freedoms were cases such as “freedom from want”, “freedom of speech”, “freedom of religion”, and “freedom of fear”.  I don’t see what being pulled over by a cop, or beaten in a protest have to do with freedoms.  They are infringements on your personal liberties though, which can be taken care of in court.  The four freedoms though are ideals that everyone should be able to account for. Well, respond if you have a chance Kornegay, I'd like to hear your response.
