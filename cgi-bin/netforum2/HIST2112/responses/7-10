===message:Your memory paints a vivid picture.  Sometimes in this modern era we forget how difficult things were in this country.  My worries now pale in comparison to the things my past generations lived through.  My father was born in the depression and growing up I was always remind to be grateful for what I had because my father lived in a tent and sometimes ate nothing but bread for days.  Kind of puts things in prospective when I worry about whether or not I will get to go on the vaction I want!
