I agree with you, Jodi...I believe that the "New Negro" was a new idenity that was celebrating unique talents and contributions to society as displayed in the Harlem Renaissance. But in the Civil Rights movements it was more of a time of fighting for rights to be able to incorporate into the "white America" through the entitlements that were due such as voting.

===message:I also agree with Jodi that this was a period in our history where African Americans celebrated their racial differences.  I also believe that this was a time when they began to define their own sub-culture in the U.S.  Since this was a time when African Americans weren’t socially accepted into the white culture, this was the time for the “New Negro” to be born.<br><br>  
   In my opinion the “New Negro” was a person who separated him or herself from how things were in the past, and began to publicize and work for recognition and status.  By becoming artists, poets, and musicians, the African American community began to define and create their own ideals and traditions.  The “New Negro” didn’t sit back and allow society to run over them.  The mass movement from the Southern States to New York City was one example of coming together and making a place in the industrial socities.<br><br>
   The Harlem Renaissance began the time when African Americans could celebrate their skills and talents and also portray them to the public.  This was the small stepping stone to the Civil Rights movement.  Until that time though, African Americans would still have to deal with segregation and suppression in many areas.  In many ways though, the Harlem Renaissance began to bring forth individuals who would fight politically for true equal freedoms.

===message:I also agree with you on that the Harlem Renaissance was a stepping stone towards the civil rights movement.  It was only a matter of time before the "new negro" would be heard. African americans were tired of not being equal to "white america" and finally with the civil rights movement their voice would be heard.

===message:I agree that the “New Negro” was “alone in their struggles to gain strength in America”, because it is basically the same way today.  When the NAACP was first begun, many white people supported it.  However, when black people made it clear that they would not be content to “stay in their place”, membership by white people declined drastically.  This proves that black people were truly alone in their struggle, because no one but another black person could really understand what the struggle for equal rights was  about and see the desperate need for an organization like the NAACP, even in the year 2003, (nearly 100 years later), showing that not much changes with time and struggle.
