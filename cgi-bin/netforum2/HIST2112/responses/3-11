===message:I have to really agree with you.  That is the exact way that I see what happened with the Homestead Strike.  Worker's wanted to be heard, and they didn't know how else to be listened to, except for violence.  They were already ruled from every angle of their lives by the companies, sooner or later they would rebel.  They were heard but nothing changed.

===message:I am not sure that the workers were really heard?  I think in those times that employers felt that you were lucky to have a job and how dare you voice an opinion otherwise.  If you don't like it leave and there are others lining up to take your job.  Times were tough, jobs were tough, and the rich were tougher. Employers were ready to call your bluff and you better be ready to show your hand. It was a very hard time to be a worker in America and there was a lot of competition for employement from both Americans and Immigrants.
