===message:I also agree that Evans was not against migration.  I believe his major concerns during this time period was the fact that some immigrants were coming from nations that believed in communism or supported the war on the side of the Axis.  This was a time when the American people needed to come together as a nation and announce their unity as a country.  During WWI, there was no time for there to be fighting and disputes within our own society.<br><br>
   Evans stressed that any immigrant has to have the desire to become Americanized.  He felt that anyone coming to our country had to have the respect of our political and legal system, and adopt the American way of life.  With the Red Scare and the events of WWI, it is easy to understand why some American people were cautious and concerned about the immigration situation.  International matters and immigration should always be monitored and observed, but this was just one time in our history where the stress levels were high and the concern was on many individuals' minds.

===message:I do not agree with your view that Evans was not totally opposed to immigration. I feel that he was because he wanted immigration, but only on his terms and this was wrong.  Immigrants were already of the right racial and national stock and most had a strong allegiance to America.  Evans used that anger against immigrants to further his own selfish causes.  However, I do agree with the rest of your analyzation of Evans’ speech; very insightful.
