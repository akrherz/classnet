===message:In the 1920's this is true that Blacks culture shined in the 20's. The expression of jazz was smooth and was a release from society. People were able to exert energy like never before. Blacks also participated in Athletics. These were the good ole days even though, blacks were still discriminated against. In the 60's things were different. Blacks fought for their future.
