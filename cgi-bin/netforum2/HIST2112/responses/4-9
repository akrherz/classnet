Your points were good...I agree with you that often times it is necessary for our country to take actions to preserve the freedoms that we enjoy. Many people flock to our homeland to escape their countries and enjoy our freedoms and I believe as you stated that we try to help other countries so they can enjoy our freedoms, but yet we are seen as dominanting and controlling.

===message:I believe that most countries view us as dominating.  But why do so many immigrants flock to our country?  That is because life seems to be better as an American. Our actions sometimes may be seen as overbearing, but we have to protect our freedoms.  Some Americans do feel that we are superior to other countries and that is what the cartoon seems to interpret to me, also.

===message:I understand protecting our freedom. But protecting our freedom at the expense of others is very costly. Aren't our freedoms the same freedoms that should be available to all people?

===message:I think the current view of our country in protection is protecting our selves first and then protecting people who are being hurt and abused by their leaders.  We don't just wage wars to help with job security...we wage wars to fight poverty, homelessness, sickness, rape and murder.  Not many people can say the victims of the crimes do not share our views inregard to the injustice of these problems.  The United States have been given the reputiation of a bully...some may feel that at times we have earned it but we have done much more good than harm.

===message:I was talking about the cartoon and the way Americans felt about us then.  I do not believe that as Americans today that we feel the same way.  Having been given a broader knowledge of Americans past, we are more than welcoming to all people today.

===message:I do not agree that the actions of America preserve our freedoms.  Our freedoms were not in danger by Iraq, but we attacked them anyway. And you can take a look at any third world country and see the bad influence that America has had. Last year, I spent 3 weeks in Belize, Central America. The majority of people there do not have running water or phones, but almost everyone has cable and they dress as Americans are depicted in music videos. It is really sad to see what America has accomplished with this culture that was at one time simple. This sad situation is repeated in many other countries.
