  Wow, you are pretty knowledgable about Unions.  I agree with what you said about labor laws/gov't regulations taking the place of Unions.  I guess that's why only 15% of workers are part of a union.  And yes, gov't will always back big business--I think it has something to do with campaign donations(tongue-n-cheek)
