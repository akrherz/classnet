===message:I agree with you but I think people also viewed immigrants as people who thought Americans had it good and wanted to come into the country and live the life that the natives had made for themselves.  I think they thought "well, now that we've done the hard part they want to come and prosper here".  In all reality it was not them but their ancestors who had suffered and worked to establish the US as a country to be envied.  Unfortunatly, There will always be people who feel they have the "right" to be Americans because they were born here and that others are just trying to get a free ride.
