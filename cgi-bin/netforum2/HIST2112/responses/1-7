===message:Now, that is something I definitely agree with John on.   I wholeheartedly believe in orderly and legal immigration.   I think that in the end, through all of the illegal immigration incidents, there appears the stark realization that it ends up detrimental in many ways...many illegal immigrants have lost their lives (and continue to lose their lives)trying to come to America, and like John said, it is a sad story to find out that illegal activity has been manuevered by an illegal immigrant, especially when our preconceived belief is that many immigrants desire to come to America for a "better life" and that any contribution that they DO make to American society should definitely NOT be a negative one...

I thoroughly enjoyed your posting. I agree with you entirely...especially about protecting our borders. I don't understand some of the actions of the INS. I work for a doctor who is from Costa Rica. He is very active in contributing to society through his volunteer work and other good deeds. To hear some of his stories that he has endured with the INS just to continue working in America is totally crazy when there are all these illegal immigrants walking around. The system makes absolutely no sense to me.

===message:If it really was only about the power and money, then, why did they start to bring and make Nationalization Clubs for the French Canadians to become Citizens of the United States?

Was it because they were white and acted like "white men"?

PLEASE...
