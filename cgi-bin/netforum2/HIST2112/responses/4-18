===message:to support Karissa's analogy, even though America is all of the things that Ashley stated(and others have also stated, including me)America is still the greatest country on earth.  Despite all of its shortcomings, corruptions, injustices, people risk their lives to come here.  Maybe it is our freedom to be able to make all of these mistakes that draws people here.  Maybe it is what Bradford claimed when he and the Puritans landed here soo many years ago that "This would be city on hill" for all who would desire freedom could come to and find a home.(hope that doesn't sound too corny) oh well;whatever the reason, Karissa is right.  America is great and I am proud to live here.

===message:I have to say that many people get this confused.  Richest country does not mean the best country.  I am happy to be American, but I don't think life would be that much worse if I were British.  I'm glad I wasn't born in a Third World country, but we as Americans need to wake up - we have a lot of issues.
