===message:Every country wants to be the best.  America has proven itself so.  We must be the judge and jury of the world and keep ourselves apprised of all that surrounds us.  Ultimately, if we let other country's do as they please, then we will suffer.  Every one wants to be the best.  When one lets his guard down, his position suffers.

===message:The U.S. enjoys shaking its fingers at other nations and strives to be the leader in everything. I agree with your statement that America is still the same as it was back in the 1800s. Even though it has become a social faux pas to have racist views, which does not mean people do not hide their socially unacceptable opinions. Again, prior to the 20th century and the various ground breaking movements, it was common for people to automatically accept the views of the masses.
