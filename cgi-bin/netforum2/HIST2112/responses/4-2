===message:I'm having trouble with your argument against the US actions in Iraq.  Perhaps you don't believe the threat of the Iraqi leaders to the United States.  We didn't go into Iraq to "make the Iraqi people's life better" as a primary reason.  The correlation between this and the white man's burden isn't clear to me from your argument.  Also, the Iraqi people were far from "free" so we weren't taking away their freedoms.  You are female- imagine yourself in the Iraqi woman's position- do the research on what their life was like before Saddam's fall.  Put on a burka in 115 degree weather and do all your grocery shopping.  Don't ever go to school just b/c you are a woman.  They had no freedoms at all.  Period.   Not the same as the men.  In this instance, the "white man" or the US came in to try to rid the country of a terrible dictator.

===message:The current actions being taken by the U.S. military and government are hotly debated.  I think right now it is politically correct to knock the U.S.  I find this very disturbing.  We are a country who feels it is our obligation to take care of the little guy.  We spend our money and sacrifice our lives for the freedom of others and contrary to popular belief, there are those who are grateful for our help.  Most of us have lived in the U.S. our entire lives and know freedom and safety.  I think that in politics and the military you have the occasional bad apple but does that spoil the bushel?  I don't think so!
