===message:I agree that Evans' ideas and thoughts were disgusting but you have to remember the times in which they were expressed.  American's were fearful of life from many aspects.  It was easy for people listening to his Rhetoric to become convinced that he was right in his beliefs.  Sometimes people are so afraid of the truth that they are willing to find scapegoats everywhere.  Power can be scary when it is held by the wrong people.
