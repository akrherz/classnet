===message:Yes, I agree that the Homestead Strike did not accomplish anything.   I think that what Berkman and Goodman were trying to do was for a good cause; however, due to the era in which they lived, which at that time was dominated by "BIG BUSINESSES", their views were neither openly prevalent or strong enough to survive such a revolution.   I think they would have had more success defending such a cause in today's times...
