===message:I don't want to get into a big 9/11 discussion but, I think Americans are so detached from reality that 9/11 still only affect those who lost loved ones and those who live in the cities in which the tragedy occurred.  Many Americans still believe that certain things cannot happen to them.  Freeway accidents, for instance, occur every day on a phenomenal scale and yet there are still more than a few idiot drivers!  Our leadership plays an enormous role in our society.  If they endorse an ignorant notion it is then embraced by ignorant minds.  This same philosophy, "White Man's Burden", is still embraced today.  The flavor of the decade is the Latin American community.  Long before Latin Americans, there were the Indians who were the "white man's burden".  They needed Christianity in order fit into American society.  Other cultures have been required to give up their identities in order to be accepted.  Is that the sacrifice that will make Americans accept you?  No, because that would not be the end of their demands, not even today.
