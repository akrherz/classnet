===message:B. I was impressed with your analysis of the material.  I whole-heartily agree with you.  I am anglo-saxon by birth, but Jewish by adoption.  Being raised in the south, I always knew of prejudice, although never practicing, but I am shocked at how narrow-minded our nation was during those years.  It almost seems like a paradox.  Where do they think their ancestors came from?  Are we all not descendants of Noah's three sons?  Well, I guess everyone doesn't believe in the Bible, but I am embarrassed that we treated immigrants with such disdain.  Thank you for your thoughts and candor; it's refreshing to hear someone to speak the truth.

===message:You've got to keep in mind that during this time period all races were not considered equal.  Racial-ethnic stratification had a huge impact during this time. And the Eugenics Movement occured during 1905 - 1933. It was founded by Sir Francis Galton. He had hoped to improve the intellectual, economic, and social level of mankind.  So the era of Evans was involved in Eugenics. I do not think that Evans was an uneducated man.  I believe that he was smart enough to manipulate many followers by scaring them.  He knew what points would make people more reluctant to accept immigrants.  I don't agree with his ideals but sadly, many did.

===message:I have to agree with Veronica on that in that day and time, we were not created equal sadly. It is a shame that so many people were in agreement with Evans.  I am glad that today we can see things ALOT differently.

===message:Thank you for the compliment, Kim.  I think Americans at that time forgot that they came to American as the “original immigrants” from England.  I, like you, am embarrassed that the history, current and past, of discrimination that the United States exhibits. I cannot believe that many “Americans” want to hide from this past rather than learn from it.  Americans still have not improved much on the same false stereotypes about race and immigrants that was established at that time.  Very Sad.

===message:I agree with what you said about discrimination. It does exist today, but not just with one race.  All races to some extent are discriminated against by another.  I believe the US has learned from the past a great deal.  So many great changes have taken place and all races are given equal opportunities to better their lives.  I also believe that "Americans" are very willing to help those who help themselves.

===message:I totally agree with everything you said. It is sad to see how ignorant this country was and still is. There are many stereotypes thrown around that people believe to be true. There will always be many stereotypes for example right now for people of middle eastern decent. It's sad how people can follow stereotypes so strictly even before getting to realize the true important points of that person. Evan's just like the rest of the KKK did not realize that this country is made by immigrants including large amounts of the people he believes to be savages. but anyway you as an African American have completely proved him wrong. America is not the land of stereotypes, but it is the land of the free...where people can be whoever they want to be.

===message:I still find it interesting when people find out about the harsh reality of history. It is just that, harsh. If history was always painted in a nice pretty picture, would anyone trully learn from it? But back to the original idea of this response, I do agree that it the Klan is a sad sad aspect of American history. It's quite shameful that the KKK opposed imigration when, as previously mentioned, they were descendants of imigrants themselves. 

However, hasn't the U.S. as a whole followed in a similar suit after September 11th? I'm not accusing anyone one person nor group, but it seems that having a hateful outlook on race, religion, etc. has risen up again. Granted, there have been no publicized reports of Klan memberships rising, but one has to consider that there seems to be a common feeling of hate is around us.

With that said, Evans used the fears of white America to create an urgency. This urgency and slandering practices caused mass membership enrollment with the Klan.

===message:Ms. Kornegay:

The sad reality is that Mr. Evans was probably an educated man.  One being educated does not bar him from possessing altogether undesireable ideologies.  In fact, it is my opinion that, the more educated a person is that possesses these types of ideologies, the more dangerous he is.  We cannot defend our ideologies against another's by stating that his lack of education is the reason for the same.
