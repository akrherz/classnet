===message:It is pretty much impossible for most Americans today to understand how the desperate situation was during the great depression.  Even though our unemployment rate is above the desired level now, and the economy is in a slump, our economical situation today is nowhere near as rough as it was in the 1930’s.  I’m sure if anyone has traveled to a poverty stricken nation somewhere else in our world today, then we might have some insight on how it was during the depression.<br><br>  
   The pictures we are provided in our text book are our only visual way of observing how things appeared.  The pictures of the children and mother certainly show how devastating it was to live during that time.  Clothing was as rags.  Hunger and uncomfortable living situations persisted in millions of peoples lives.  People migrated from city to city hoping that somewhere a working opportunity would show itself.  Everyone was affected in some way or another during this time.  Businesses were affected by the tariffs which prevented trade with foreign nations.  The wealthy individuals were heavily taxed due to the Revenue Act proposed by the New Deal programs.  Millions of folks were out of work and wandering for employment.  <br><br>
This was definitely a time when society had little hope.  After learning more about the great depression, I can say that I am grateful we are in relatively good shape today compared to the 1930s.

===message:wow, Trisha--yes, you said it all.  The photo of the woman and child does humanize the whole scenario.  I also agree that the government "propaganda" in the camp photos sent a strong message to the rest of America who were on-lookers of the tragedy.  Nice insight.
