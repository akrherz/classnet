===message:This seems like a very good comparison.  At one point in history, a group of Americans became fixated on becoming a more Americanized country.  The Ku Klux Klan did seem to be on the track of making a "master race" to a certain extent like Hitler did.  They obviously did not go to the extremes that Hitler did, but it was close.
