===message:I agree that Americans do not -down to this day- acknowledge how it acquired its' weatlth. Immigrants from all over did the hard jobs "Americans" did not want.  Similarly, through forced slave labor, African Americans, especially in the South, built up America. Through their blood, sweat, and tears, the South was built. Crops of cotton and tobacco were sold making Slave Owners wealthy. This wealth was passed down thier generations, making it so much easier for Whites today. This is considered "old" money.
