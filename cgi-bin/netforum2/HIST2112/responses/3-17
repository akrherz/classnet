===message:Unions seem to be somewhat of a thing fo the past, However there are some fileds of work that the employees can only benefit from the protection and the publicity that only a union can provide.  I beleive that some unions in past years as well as currently can have unreasonable requests on employers, but they can do it in the name of protecting the employees (union members), and their lifestyle.  Americans are opposed to unions because they can be unreasonable and can halt an entire industry in an instant.  Think back to last year when the dock workers in Seattle were on strike the entire country felt the ripple affects.  In my own job our shipments coming into the store were delayed by weeks because of the strike and even though it was over within a couple weeks it took several more weeks to get caught up with the back log. In my opinion Homestead act of 1897 did not accomplish anything.
