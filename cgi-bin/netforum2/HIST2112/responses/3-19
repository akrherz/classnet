===message:I agree with you that before there may have been a purpose for unions - to protect the worker from the overdemanding boss - but now there are labor laws saying how many hours a person can work in a day and what the minimum wage a person can earn, etc.  Unfortunately, the benefits of some unions are not as great as they once used to be.  For example, my husband's medical benefits keep decreasing while the union dues keep going up.  Something definitely needs to be changed.
