===message:I can agree with many of the points that you have made here.  However, it sounds a bit sympathetic and I do not, personally, believe that it is deserving.  Wizard Evans is simply playing on the same "fears" that pre-Wizard Evans Americans played on.  Each time native born Americans fell on unfortunate times, the blame was never placed at the feet of the Commander-in-Chief, the local politicians, Americans themselves, or foreign policies that lay behind mass immigration but simply placed squarely on the shoulders of the immigrants themselves.  All of a sudden, the jobs that payed meager wages were like prime rib and the fact that immigrants were maintaining their employment meant stability to those who had lost employment.  Of course, at this particular point in history and before, the Irish and African had always been the "subhuman" made to bear the blame for "causing" the economic disarray of the Anglo-Saxons.
