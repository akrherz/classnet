===message:I think we all agree that immigrants are a threat to Americans.  I agree strongly with you point about taxes and special benefits.  If they want to create an atmosphere where everyone lives equal, then everything should be equal.

===message:When immigrants come to this country it is often with hopes and dreams of a better life than what was had.  More often than not, immigrants come from other countries that are beyond any American's scope of the reality of true poverty.  Are we to not allow any tax breaks or governmental assistance to these people?  Do we allow them to continue to starve and suffer here in our country?  No.  We help them to help themselves exactly how we assist natural born American citizens. Because of the many different people who come to reside here, our country is the richest in culture and finance around the globe.  Why shouldn't we offer immigrants many if not all of the same luxuries as Americans?  If they work hard and take "our" jobs then Americans have to work harder to get them back.  In addition, you say that immigrants get special treatment.  Can you give an example?  And for every example that you give I can promise, that I can give you an example where it is much more advantageous just to be an American.  I can assure you that it is not an easy task to be an immigrant in this country.  Especially these days.

===message:In order to assist immigrants in becoming self-sufficient, it is a necessity that the U.S. maintain and enforce an orderly and reasonable system of intake. It is reasonable to help the newcomer, but only thru a system that is orderly, and affordable, will we remain able to help anyone.

===message:The chinese immigration should have helped America. But what we founded was they became an inferior race to us.  When they threated "white America" with lower wages and long working hours, Americans resented the fact they the Chinese were literally robbing them of their dreams.  It is hard enough being an American in America. I can only imagine being an immigrant.

===message:I understand what you are saying. But answer me this.  Do we help immigrants? or do we help our elderly? I can give example after example of the lack of assitance given to the elderly. And keep in mind that these are people that have worked hard as Americans all of their lives. Do we tell them that they have to die due to lack of medication coverage. Many of their prescriptions range from $300 - $600. How can we live with ourselves as Americans when we do not help those Americans who need the greatest help.

===message:The example of tax breaks are what I consider special treatment.  It seems that you agree that so called special treatment has been given and therefore  has breed hostility in many.  I gave valid reasons that causes many Americans to look at immigrants in a different light. I not getting into the debate about whether it's much better to be an American or not.

===message:Connie,
It seems that if immigrants are willing to come to America and work really hard (long hours at menial jobs) for low pay, Americans should realize the greatness of this country.  So many people come here looking for a better life than where they come from and are willing to work harder than those who were born here.  Who would put the brick on your house or do the landscaping at your country club or wait tables at the restaurant you eat in or do your nails in the local nail salon etc.  Look around at those who are doing a good job for a good wage and not moaning and complaining about wages and benefits.  I live in a place where many immigrants, possibly illegals, live and work and I see them riding bicycles to work and carpooling and sharing apartments with many people and doing the jobs I mentioned above.  My question to all is who would do these jobs, really, if they weren't here?  Most Americans I know think they are "above" this kind of work.  I have teenagers who don't even want to work for less than $8 an hour because they found a job to pay that.  When that job was no longer available, they balked at getting a minimum wage job.  We are spoiled as Americans and could learn a lot from these immigrants who value life in America so much that they risk deportation and sacrifice much to be here.
