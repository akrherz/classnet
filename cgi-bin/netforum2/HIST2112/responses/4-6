===message:<p>I thought your breakdown of each of the individual men mentioned and their reasons for supporting or being against the white man’s burden was well analyzed.  I also would like to state for Kipling, that I think he justified Imperialism for the same reasons that other English colonists did around that period.  They believed that they were doing the morally right choice by transferring an “uncivilized or savage race” and turning them into properly educated individuals.  It wasn’t a matter of whether or not invading foreign lands were right, the main reason for doing this was because it was an obligation for the English empire.  These reasons are of course up to debate, pending that we look at these colonies as territorial and economical gains.  All that can be said about Kipling is that he supported imperialism, publicly wrote and published his beliefs, and also that he supported what was a large part of the competing nations during the 19th century.</p>
   <p>To briefly mention, Tillman and Twain, we know they were against the White Man’s Burden.  Tillman of course stated that the peoples were not worth conforming or accepting into our own culture.  He probably could be seen as having political reasons for being against annexations and imperialism.  The more diverse the nation was, the more varied the values and beliefs of the country would be.  Tillman probably looked at annexation as a means of bringing new voters into the population, with values that greatly differed from American’s back in the states.  Mark Twain looked at the annexation of the Philippines similarly to that of hypocrisy.  It was just wrong in his eyes, to bring one colony to independence through war, grant their freedom, only to take the newfound nation as our own territory.</p>
   <p>All these men had different ideals and beliefs.  They probably only touch the surface of many American’s and their feelings on such issues during this period of Imperialism.</p>

===message:I don't believe that Tillman was implying the Phillipinos weren't worth their time in conforming them to American culture.  I could be wrong, but I believe he was attempting to convey that America was already suffering from trying to integrate the races and cultures that were in America without bringing in yet another, completely different, culture.
