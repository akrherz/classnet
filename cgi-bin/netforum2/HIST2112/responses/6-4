===message:It must have been a sad time during the Harlem Renaissance as you had mentioned.  Today our talents of all races are praised and to have had such great strengths and talent back then and not felt important im sure was hard for most African Americans. Being repressed for so many years, I feel that was alot to do with the civil rights movement.
