===message:True, even for the people who did share the views of Berkman & Goldman, I just don't think they were ready to commit themselves to such outspoken measures...they were used to having to accept certain things; thus, they probably felt that liberating themselves from (or at least, attempting to liberate themselves from)their suffering was not worth the chance of what they might lose in the end...
