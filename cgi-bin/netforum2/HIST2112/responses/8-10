===message:I think that Roosevelt wanted us to think that these Four Freedoms should be universal to people everywhere in the world, but I think he was being political.  Although he turned down Rockwell's depictions in the begining, once they were well liked he joined the bandwagon.  I am never sure that we can every fully trust what a President says and take it at face value.  Every statement is well thought out for reprocussions, and this one was probably no different.  But I agree that yes, Rockwell's pictures did undermine this universal message.

===message:I agree, Roosevelt's concept of "universiality" was not very inclusive and was strictly a political move. Much like some decisions that are made today. Rockwell on the other hand captured those in society he felt should be afforded these freedoms.
