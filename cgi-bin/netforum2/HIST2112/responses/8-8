===message:I think you brought some good insight to the discussion Stephanie.  Rockwell’s paintings and advertisements weren’t only of his own feelings or beliefs, but also probably influenced somewhat on the general public.  During this time we know whites had a great deal more power over any other race in the country.  Whites dominated the industry, legislative system, and were the primary voters.  Almost all major concerns were reflected by white people.  This is probably a reason why Rockwell’s art didn’t reflect minorities in America.  Back before the free rights movement this is how our nation worked.  You were correct that a more broad display of American values would have brought outrage.<br><br>  
   Whenever a major politician of president proposed law or legislation to support equal rights the white population, generally the southern states were against it.  From our text book on page 759 when Truman set up the Committee on Civil Rights, anger was apparent from the southern states.  It was difficult for some people to express their feelings on the four freedoms for all Americans.  This was especially true for the politicians who required the votes of the primarily voting white population.  After WWII the Civil Rights movement would gain greater momentum.  President Truman knew that it would be deceitful to support freedom and democracy around the world if it wasn’t truly represented here in America.<br><br>
   The four freedoms were important during WWII.  They helped support the democratic movement for free nations to govern themselves apart from a socialistic government.  Sadly though, the supporters who were able to express their thoughts on the issue, such as Norman Rockwell, had a limited view of who should receive these freedoms in the U.S.  After the war and matters back in the States would try to normalize, women and African Americans would not allow these freedoms to remain solely in white male hands.  Eventually after the laws to support anti-discrimination and the Civil Rights movement, all Americans would be able to fully experience the four freedoms.
