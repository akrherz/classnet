===message:I am in agreement with you and it was an eyeopener for me, as well.  I had not thought of it in those terms either.

===message:You are so right!  I have seen many of his pictures, but not once have I ever noticed that there is only one race present.  I think he did feel strongly about the four freedoms, but like you said, these freedoms were restricted due to his era.  Good Posting!!

===message:I think that what I was suprised about was the slogans on the pictures.  My grandmother gave me a set of Norman Rockwell plates before she died and they have these depictions on them but not the slogans...Buy War Bonds and Ours...to Fight For.  I think that these slogans are very important when we look at which groups were alienated.

===message:I agree with you overall assessment of Rockwell’s paintings.  Rockwell had one other painting, “The Problem We All Live With”, that showed an African-American little girl in it.  It was based on what Ruby Bridges went through as a little girl de-segregating an all-white school under military escort.  Rockwell was so popular because Americans really wanted to believe that America would stay as it was BEFORE the war…white, prosperous and male-dominated. Women and minorities had another vision of “America” and fought to gain it.
