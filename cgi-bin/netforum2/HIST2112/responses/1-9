===message:I agree that there are some fundamental differences in work ethic between Chinese and American societies at that period of time. Not to mention differences in culture and appearance. But the real perceived threat to Americans from the Chinese was an economic one due to the depressed conditions in America at that time, especially the scarcity of jobs. Although the Chinese did indeed seem to make it harder for SOME white Americans to get work, the economic situation just served to intensify the underlying prejudices. That caused some political leaders to turn the Chinese as a people into a scapegoat for those would or could not find other answers to dealing with the difficult economic conditions.

===message:We all know that still today we are dealing with the same thing that was going on back in the 19th century. The immigrants have been a threat to American for a long time because they are smart and self motivated people.  Therefore, we as American do what we do best when we are inferror of other.  We make them feel rejected in society.  Consquently, they do not feel part of America.  That is where the separation comes.  However, rejection makes them stronger.

===message:I agree that Americans do reject anything not the “norm”.  I do not agree that rejection from society makes those discriminated against stronger. Black Americans are still discriminated against and our society is NOT stronger because of it. I think the result is a constant struggle to try to achieve what is easy for “Americans”.  Statistics show that the job market favors white Americans. For performing the same job, white male Americans are paid the most, female white Americans are second, black male Americans are next and black female Americans are last. Immigrants are paid even lower. No, victims of discrimination and prejudice do not “feel part of America”, as Ms. Bush stated, but we make the best of what is available to us and fight for what we deserve : equal rights for ALL "Americans".
