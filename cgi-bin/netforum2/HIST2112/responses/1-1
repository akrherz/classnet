===message:I agree with a lot of what Jade says, however... weren't most Americans descendants of immigrants?  My parent's parents came from Austria and Germany and came to New York through Ellis island in the early 1900's.  So aren't I a result of their immigration?  Aren't I an American because of it?  We should embrace immigrants- remember the "melting" pot?  As for the Chinese, of course they were brought here in the thousands to do a job and when the job was over, stayed on to try to find work in an economic depression.  This exacerbated the already skewed prejudices people had.  I grew up in New York and I remember when waves of Puerto Ricans came into the city...it seemed that there were more than could get work.  As depicted in Leonard Bernsteins "West Side Story", the prejudices were often totally unsubstantiated.  Perhaps that contributed to the culture of the Californian's disdain for the Chinese.

===message:Yes, most Americans are descendants of immigrants...I myself am one.   In saying "Americans" (and in context with the questions that were given), I was referring to those particular Americans who perhaps do have a problem with immigration and/or are biased against them.  It's funny, though...I'm sure that a number of the Americans who do have a problem with immigrants are probably descendants of immigrants, and may not even know or realize it...

===message:I believe you have alot of good points.  The main issue seems to be the threat that immigrants create in the work field. I feel that American have a huge amount of racial-ethnic stratification.  But this usually appears in most societies.

===message:I agree with everyone on the subject of discriminating against chinese immigrants. Denis Kearney obviously forgot he was an immigrant himself. The so called "Workingmen's Party" remind me of a group of men who like to wear their own bed sheets. It is true people fear what they know little or nothing about. Denis Kearney knew nothing about chinese people.

===message:
In general it does seem that Americans strongly feel that immigrants should easily adapt to as you called it the "American Ideal" I agree with you Americans seem to display opposition when immigrants don't fit in to their American role and the immigrants display their differences. When considering the transition that immigrants encounter I can't even imagine how it would feel to arrive in an unfamiliar land with a completely different language, customs, and traditions. I think a lot of Americans feel that immigrants come to enforce their own way of life, but I think the immigrants aren't simply welcomed to assimilate into the American life and so they retreat to the only way they know thus establishing their own communities, identities, etc.

===message:Yes, that could be a strong factor.   In addition, many immigrants come to America for a better economic and political situation...but many view the American social situation as detrimental to their values regarding family, so they choose not to assimilate in that aspect.
