===message:Stephanie I agree with many of the issues that you bring up in your discussion and, as you say "do we not learn".  To me this is a very interesting point, not only did the Ku Klux Klan felt that they had to protect the American "Race and Values" from the immigrants that discovered and built this Nation, they had to punish them and make them beleive something other than what and who they are.  How can they try to change what is basically so beautifull about this country, "the melting pot" that is what constitutes the United States of America.  I will say that again, The United States of America, this is what has made and makes this country so ambitioned and hated at the same time by all other countries.  They want to protray an image of friendship and being "United", as long as the color of your skin and your physical features, and your language falls into their qualifying criteria of what an American is.  So, refering to the cartoon of "Our Educators", they were really portraying the hipocrites that they are!

===message:Please take note that I am not promoting the ideologies of the Ku Klux Klan in any way, but truthfully, would we not be just as discriminating if we did not allow the Ku Klux Klan the right to organization?  We must govern their activities as we do any other, making sure that they do not promote or participate in unlawful activity.  I'm sure there are existing members of the Black Panthers or other hate organizations.  It seems to me that, all too often, we only berate those "hate organizations" that were traditionally promoters of segregation, instead of berating all of the hate organizations, no matter how they were formed or for what they stood.  If we ban one, we must ban them all.

===message:Well, Stephanie..things are a bit puzzling regarding Wizard Evans.  That's because he was as ignorant as he was long winded.  As with all situations throughout history where someone decides to speak unintelligibly on behalf of Anglo-Saxons, The Wizard decided to use "facts" in a way that would misrepresent themselves in the eyes of a distraught public.  This type of discrimination continues today for very simple reasons.  What you may consider harmless terminology helps to promote it.  For example, events such as the Tennis Masters Series, the PGA Masters Series, in aircraft there are such components as the Master Governor and the Slave Governor.  Discrimination and prejudice is perpetuated in our society on a much more discreet level but just as prevalent as "The Red Scare".

===message:I enjoyed your analysis of this material.  The reference to Asia and math, and Galileo and Columbus was brilliant.  I never really thought about those things in that light.  It is painfully evident that, as you say,  Evans is a hypocrite.  
<p>
The Klan is still organized, and even puts on marches.  Its' ignorant members still have not “learn[ed] from all the chaos and pain that is caused by…stereotypes”.   After all these years, it is a pitiful state of affairs.
