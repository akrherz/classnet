===message:As they were gaining their freedom and establishing their place amongs the Americans and showing them that they too were American, in sharing their talents and making a living of what they loved and is part of their culture and a part of them, Americans looked at the African Americans of the 1920's diferently.  Americans enjoyed their music, paintings, photography, poetry, etc...all of this probably paved the way to the Civil Rights to become posible for them.

===message:It think it is more than just a continuation. By the 1960's many minorities had suffered for so long that they were ready for a change. This motivated them to fight for those freedoms and equalities promised to "all people". Yes, the blacks of the 1920's did contribute a great deal to this movement. However, it took a collective people to set the movement in motion and continue the fight.
