===message:And indeed they did.  African American influence is such a vital part of America's present day that it's hard to distinguish from any other influential group.

===message:This was a time when African Americans, despite a lack of progress in establishing their free and equal status within society at large, were continuing to realize their own potential for contributing to the arts and intellectual ideas of the age. It is remarkable the amount of influence African american artists, writers and musicians (especially) had and continue to have on the popular culture of all of America considering the ongoing suppression of their rights.

===message:Yes, the artists of the Harlem Renaissance created a place for themselves in history.  I think it would be wonderful if they all could have seen how their work was revered and studied for years to come.  They created art out of celebration and expression and it came to mean so much more in American history.
