===message:I agree that the government went to great lengths to show its generousity in the "staged" photos.  I also concur with your assessment that these photos give us a glimpse into the pain these people must have felt.  I don't know how we would handle a catastophy like the depression/dust bowl, probably not as courageously.  Good insight.
