===message:I'm not sure American equality means each worker in every workplace should be treated the same.  Granted we don't want sweatshops like there used to be but this society is a capitalist society. As long as conditions are humane, they can be different depending on the individual company's philosophy and objectives.  Some companies will spend much on lavish offices and workplace settings and others will be in a stark utalitatian office and workplace.  Ever wonder how Sam Walton made his millions?  Frugality.  So, if workers don't like the conditions in one place (ie/ benefits, pay, environment) they have the freedom (another American ideal) to leave and seek employment elsewhere.  Competitive pay and benefits will be generated by the workforce exercising this right.  Unions are not necessarily the best way for workers to get better conditions etc.  Federal laws protect the worker from basic inequalities like equal # of rest rooms for women and men etc, but not to regulate pay beyond the minimum wage.

===message:I very much agree with your reply.  We do have the choice to choose more desirable conditions. If you are unhappy with a job, choose a different one.  If you are not qualified for a job, obtain an education.  And yes, there are federal laws that support equality.  Equal pay for equal work act, etc.

===message:I agree that Berkman and Goldman, as immigrants, felt this need to help the "underdog".  As you stated, they "had no intuition to try and solve things the legal way".  There was no method to their madness. They did not even have the support of the workingmen or their union. Apparently, both were misguided extreme idealists. It is interesting that after prison, Berkman toned his tune down quite a bit and seemed to live a much quieter life.  His death was not a he had written it should be, "a sacrifice on the alter of the people", rather a cowards way out.
