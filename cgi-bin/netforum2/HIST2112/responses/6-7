===message:I have to say that this is a very difficult and uncomfortable subject.  But I have to express my views on the issue of discrimination.  Like I said earlier, every race is to some extent a victim of discrimination.  A comment was made earlier about economic inequality involving "white" people.  A large factor to this aspect is high school drop out rates and college degrees.  Although these numbers have been steadily rising since 1978, African Americans had much higher rates of drop outs than whites did.  Also college degree's were seen to be much higher amongst the white's.  Like I said, these rates have been climbing steadily since 1978.  As more and more African Americans pursue college degrees, I'm sure you will find that economic equality will follow.  The "affirmative action" comment is not really something I can reply to due to lack of knowledge. But I will say that I do not beleive that someone should get a job over a more qualified individual just because of their race. If someone works hard for their knowledge, then they should be rewarded for their hard work. I think that all of this resentment is the single most important aspect that feeds discrimination.  The most important thing is to learn from the past, improve your future, and move on with life.  I am a woman, I am Irish, and I am middle-class. All of these characteristics have been discriminated against at one time or another. But I love the fact that I'm a middle-class, Irish woman. I truly hope that this reply has not offended any of my fellow classmates.  That is certainly not my intent.

===message:Veronica,
  I am from a Jewish family and I married into a Cuban family.  Although I was raised in the South and have never been personally discriminated against, I do get angry when assumptions are made about Jewish/hispanic people.  I can see "B's" view very clearly, that the whites have had a "head start" in this country: the history of the African-American in the US is tragic. However, I whole-heartedly agree with you that, in this day and time, anyone who wishes to move ahead can.  That does not discount the fact that there are deep-rooted prejudices, especially here in the South, but attitude and determination is something we all have a choice in.  Thank you for your courage and Thank you "B" for expressing yourself so beautifully.

===message:I completely agree with you on the affirmative action deal.   I myself am a minority; however, I still believe that someone should be given a position based on their qualification, rather than due to their race...or "quotas".  I think that if I was a well accomplished individual who had worked really hard to obtain success, I would actually be insulted if my efforts were passed over and my race, NOT my accomplishments, were the only consideration in the selection process for hiring me.

===message:After reading your explenation I have to say that it is not only well put and deep, you are right.
Eventhough the African-Americans were not free in the 1920's and had to vow down before white folks, they were claiming their freedom amongs each other, but more importantly amongs the white people by demonstrating that they were more than a color, that they could read, write and compose some incredible music & poems as well as paint and exel in many arts.  The Harlem Renaissance was the begining of the long road to freedom and when they were ready they took the moment and claimed their rights to it.
Very nice B.

===message:Veronica,  
I just have to comment on your reply.  African Americans have a higher drop out rate than whites because of the inequalities that they suffer from day one.  Being treated as an inferior does not change just because you go to high school or college.  Most African-Americans come from a single parent home.  Disadvantage #1.  Their one parent is not getting paid what a white person doing the same job is getting paid. Disadvantage #2.  This is a stressful situation for kids to grow up in.  Many African-American parents are so discouraged by their inability to progress in the world that they turn to drugs and/or alcohol. Disadvantage #3. Not that YOU ever had to, but many young African-Americans begin to work to help support their families as soon as they are able to.   This in turn causes grades to slip because it is more important to help pay the rent than to make straight A’s. And who has time for homework when you get off work at 9:00 p.m.?  This is not good for getting scholarships to colleges.  Disadvantage #4.  The list is endless. 
<p>
Speaking of colleges, when was the last time you looked at the rising cost of tuition and books?  When your family is already at or just above the poverty line, do you REALLY think there is money for you to go to college???  NO, there isn’t.  Sad to say, this is just a spiral that begins at young age and persistently follows you throughout the rest of your life. I’m talking from my own experience and countless of my associates.  You will never experience discrimination to this extent because you LOOK like the rest of the world that is in control, even if your roots are Irish. That look ALONE will get you hired for a job that I would be more qualified for. 
<p>
Being that you are of middle-class, you know better than I that money has it's own advantages.  Most middle-class kids are given a car when they turn 16 and wear designer clothes to school; get braces when needed and shop at big-name department stores wherever they like with no financial consequences. Middle-class people usually have great credit, since there is no need to use credit to buy basic necessities; they also drive late model, expensive cars that they got for a great, low interest rate...because they are white,....need I go on??  Did you ever have to work a mall job and go to school at the same time?? I think not. 
<p>
Though more African-Americans are getting degrees, as you say, “economic equality” has not followed.  College degree or not, we cannot change our color and force employers to hire us or pay us what our white counterparts make.  
<p>
I am not going to comment on the affirmative action issue, because like most typical “Americans”, you just don’t understand.

===message:I must say, "B" things got a bit heated there..I'd like to lend my knowledge of the subject and interject that I am a minority with a college degree, I am furthering my career by achieving a certificate.  I took my previous history class in North Dakota (not very broad history) and was not accepted at CCSU.  But, I digress.  I am currently employed with a major corporation and with all of the "real world" experience and knowledge, I have not been able to advance with my company because it is so rooted in the "good ole boy" network.  If one is not a good "kiss up" and won't hesitate to challenge, then one is considered a threat.  So far, I have been just that type of employee.  Though I am well spoken and have briefed very high officials with the U.S. government, I have not been deemed worthy of a position of authority.  I have actually been told by an Executive with my company that certain people are "groomed" for high positions.  As for Veronica and her comments regarding the drop-out rate of African Americans, I would like to ask if she knows anything about the funding for "majority" (all) black schools?  Does she know anything about school consolidations?  Does she know that public schools in wealthy areas mislead the public into believing they are private.  These same schools make it nearly impossible for blacks to be accepted, unless you know someone with direct connection to the acceptance process.  No, these are not colleges but Pre-k programs and grammar schools.  So, you see, there is a societal "disadvantage" at birth for African-Americans.  I, personally, consider myself American, because as far as I know my ancestors were American born.  Sure, you could make the argument that if I trace back far enough I would find that someone on my family tree was African born.  But, as far as I can tell those African born ancestors were abandoned on the island of the Bahamas when the Anglo-Saxons had no further use for them and migrated to the Carolinas.  I guess, in short Veronica, I am saying that the need for discriptive suffixes onto the word American has been exhausted and a tool for discrimination.  Also, the statistics that you gave for African-American "non-success"  often come with extenuating circumstances that you don't seem to be aware of.
