===message:Yes, Veronica you are so right.  I think that many times we look at all the negativity and forget about all of the postive things that came from this time.  I agree with you that this was a postive time for blacks in our history.

===message:You were right with all of your statements in your posting.  This was a seriously needed time for African Americans to join together as one body and create a culture of their own and also to take a stand against the predominately white community.  The migrations to New York, not only was a choice for new job opportunities and economic profitability, but also a chance for the people to unite and stand firm in creating their culture.  There were many intellectual artists, writers and musicians who desired to have their works expressed publicly.  The creation of Jazz music helped to make this happen, and assimilate itself into the white community too, as young white Americans enjoyed this new breed of music.<br><br>  
   The “New Negro” was a person who was willing to stand up against discrimination and express the right to be equal.  Although this movement was strong, it was not focused on civil rights.  The African American communities did find more opportunities, but they were still economically unequal to whites.  This time wasn’t wasted though, as in decades to come, true legal equality would prevail.

===message:I think many of you have completely missed the point and result of the Harlem Renaissance.  As stated earlier, it was a developing of the Negro culture for blacks by blacks.  Blacks ceased to try to be accepted by Anglo-Saxons and turned to developing and distiguishing their own culture.  The music was then accepted by some "whites" but the musicians were not.  In some places frequented by "whites" the music was banned because it was deemed too seductive and poisonous.  Much of the time the music was allowed to be played at small, seedy, underground clubs where "whites" could enjoy the music secretly.  When blacks decided to travel north, it was simply to escape the persecution experienced in the south where it was still a way of life for "whites" to lynch blacks for being on the same side of the street with them.  "Segregation was rule in the south but habit in the north".  Unfortunately, Veronica, discomfort in discussing a topic is the reason for idleness on certain societal problems.
