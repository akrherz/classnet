===message:I agree that what happen to the Chinese was pure prejudice from people what felt their economy and social environment was about to change. Politics became a major part of the Chinese problems in American. They didn’t have so call leaders as other groups to speak in there defend. The politicians use this as a way of the exposing lies and false information about the Chinese people. American who had no dealing with the Chinese became threaten with information they were receiving from their American political leaders. Such as, they were lazy and drunkard people, who stole their jobs. The attitudes of some Americans are still the same over one hundred years later.
