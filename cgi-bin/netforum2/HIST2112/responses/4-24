===message:I agree with AnnMarie.  I also think that the picture on page 4 depicts accurately what Americans thought the "white man's burden" was.  Still, today, Americans invade a country under the guise of "liberation" citing a country's poor leadership and meager survival as other reasons for "bearing the burden".  American leaders did and do count on the ignorance of the majority of its citizens regarding another country's welfare and then our country becomes a self-appointed liberator and savior.  Many of us know that it is simply greed but choose not to acknowledge it.  Kipling thought that other cultures were, indeed, subcultures and were weaker and altogether inferior to Americans and was steadfast in his views.  He did not say in these exact words but I'm sure he would have enjoyed a global invasion by America.
