Your words definately ring true about the pictures of the Dust Bowl. I thought you made a great point about how each pictures tells a story of survival...that is so true. Each picture is displaying sadness and a sense of loss, but also the fact that the people, the family has survived.

===message:I disagree that the Visalia pictures show that “It was Camp life for most”.  There were very few people who actually benefited from these camps. Although eventually 95 of these camps were in operation, it still did little to give relief to those who needed it most---the poorest of the poor.  It is bad that only land owners benefited from programs that Roosevelt set up, like the ERA or the TVA.  People who were landless; migrants, tenants, and sharecroppers, did not benefit from the New Deal programs.
