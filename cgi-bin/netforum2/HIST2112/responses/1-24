I agree with your position about Americans wanting to preserve their ways and not wanting to infuse other cultures, but what about the difficult times Americans were going through then?  Everyone wanted and needed a job, but now with the rush of Chinese on the west coast, Americans had it that much harder to find a job.
Anyone have an opinion about why we (Americans) still find it difficult to accept other cultures?
