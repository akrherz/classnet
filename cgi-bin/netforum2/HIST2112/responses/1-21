===message:Linda Simmons I like the fact that you mentioned the fact that Americans didn't and in fact, still don't, acknowlege how they have acquired certain things.  Even in the 19th century, the Americans should have been thankful for the Chinese laborers instead of hating and trying to ban them from the country.  Had it not been for those immigrants, the transcontinental railroad may not have been built, many of the small restaurants and small businesses that we so frequently visit may not exist.  Instead of hating, we need to be thankful for not only the chinese, but also for the many other immigrants we have in out country that add diversity and bring new businesses to America.

===message:I agree with your saying that the Chinese were mistreated because they didn't have anyone to stand up for them.  American's did not understand or seem to want to understand why the Chinese had their own culture.  The Chinese came to America for the same reasons as the other immigrants and were hard workers.  The unfortunate timing of their arrival during the depression only made their experiences much worse.
