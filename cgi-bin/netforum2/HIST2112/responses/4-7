===message:I also see that America has assumed itself as an elite nation among the other nations today.  Our government tends to try to negotiate hostilities between nations and aid the weak and helpless nations.  In most ways we do help and protect other nations.  We have been in a relationship with Israel for over 50 years.  This is one example of us helping another nation stand tall, in the midst of the surrounding nations who are against it.  Even though we have gave aid and helped so many countries, that doesn’t mean we have not abused our powers ever in the past.  The Philippines in my opinion, is an example when we took our powers to the extreme to our own advantage.  We helped bring this colony out of rule from Spanish rule, only to take the territory as our own.  It was a economic move to have a better stand in foreign trades and for a position in the West Pacific, but does that justify domination?  <br><br>  I do believe that our Nation does assist other nations in the world, but we also follow our own self interests also.  It can almost be seen as a game over economic gain and stability.  If a Nation is strong enough to influence and take what they that will further need make them great, then they will use this influence and power to attain this.

I agree with you, Jodi. I know others feel that America is dominating and controlling, but I do not feel that America sets out to be a big controlling force, but rather attempts to assist other countries, situations in need because it is almost an unspoken duty to help out.

===message:There is no doubt that America has helped many countries in times of need and made humanitarian contributions to these societies; however, let's remember what we are dealing with-America is such a powerful country, and with power comes a drive to maintain that position. It is impossible for such a powerful country to make any acquisitions on a completely humanitarian basis...politics and economics play a major role in such events, more than we know...which can be good or bad.
