===message:I agree that Americans are greedy. Many Americans see wealth and social stature as the ultimate gage of having a perfect life. Many of these same Americans will do whatever it takes to establish this "perfect life". Including and not limited to using others weakness for their own financial gain. It is very sad that this is still occurring today, being that so many people have lost their lives in the process.

===message:I thought our country was based on the ideals of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, but to many that happiness comes from being rich.  Are we all so shallow, I am begining to belive yes!  We want other people to do the cheap grunt work, but do not let immigrants make a fortune at our expense.  I am a teacher ed major and you would not believe how many people say...if your going to college you should do something that pays more money.  Even other students in my teacher ed classes are already complaining about teacher pay...teachers are underpaid but it that really the point.  Does happiness always come from the almighty dollar...not usually.
