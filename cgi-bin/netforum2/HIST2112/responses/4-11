===message:I completely agree with you about what the "burden" should actually be...To many people in other nations, America is seen as the "the final destiny", the "land of golden opportunities", etc.   They come to escape from a life of what we as present day Americans could never even imagine having to experience.   Many Americans are against immigration because they feel that the immigrants are "invading" America, as if America belonged to a certain one entity or group of people.  What many fail to realize is that they themselves are able to enjoy this "land of the free" because of the sacrifices that their ancestors may have made to come to this country long ago.   Which begs the question, to whom does America belong to anyway?

===message:I, also, do not understand why Kipling and others felt that their ideas and beliefs were superior above all others.  They did not respect other cultures and diversity; they simply imposed their beliefs on others.  I on the other hand do think that America is still racist and exploitive.

===message:I agree that America has earned the "image" of being racist and elitist.  It is more than an image, it is fact. Also, history bears out the fact that the U.S. is very good at stripping other countries of their rights under the guise of "civilization".  I agree with Mark Twain that this is obvious hypocrisy.  I do not agree that America currently is not racist. Quite the opposite, racism is alive and thriving in the U.S. today.  After 9/11, this racism was evident in the way Iraqis and those who looked like Iraqis were treated.  I flew to Minnesota and New Jersey this month and the only people specially selected for further searches were those who looked Middle Eastern. Also, the top leaders in management in the leading Fortune 500 companies are all white men. That is clearly racism in action.  Non-whites are quite capable of performing these jobs but are not even granted an equal chance to prove this. Yes, "America the free", if you are the right color, class, and know the right people.
