Your posting was very helpful for me...it summed up into words exactly how I felt concerning the unfairness that the African Americans received. The analogy of the tiger in the zoo with an attempted natural habitat was a good one...that has to be how the African Americans felt...for once they felt that their was a glimpse of freedom through the expression of their artistic abilities, but yet they didn't get to fully enjoy the freedom because they still suffered unfair, cruel treatment. It definately had to be a time of happiness for the partial freedom, but also sadness because of the continued cruel treatment.
