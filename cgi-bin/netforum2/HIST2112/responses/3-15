You were right on target with your response.  Americans are selfish and only want to make things better for themselves individually –not as a group.  Also, your comparison of corporations yesterday compared to today was awesome.  I have never pictured it that way before but it is still true today that employees are generally expected to give 2 weeks notice before leaving a job (or risk a bad recommendation), and conversely, an employer will lay off or fire employees with absolutely no notice.  The corporations still have the power.
