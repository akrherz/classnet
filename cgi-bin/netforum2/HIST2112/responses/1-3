===message:It's interesting to note that, a major part of the immigrants' "customs" or should I say ethics, involves hard work and a tolerance for low wages..this is contributed mainly to the fact that in most of their originating countries, this a normal and accepted way of life.  Then we they bring those same ethics and values to America, and suddenly they become undeserving "benefactors" of American capitalism...

===message:I agree that some of those customs are related to work ethic, but some of them also are related to religion, family values, and government beliefs.  I think the members of the "workingmen's party"  discriminated against the chinese based mostly on the scarcity of jobs, but alot of discrimination is based on some of the other cultural differences.  Sometimes our greatest fears are of things we don't understand...that doesn't make them right, it just makes us ignorant.
