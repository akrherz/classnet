===message:I agree the the U.S tries to maintain superiority over other nations. It does this by using money to control other nations. I also agree that the U.S. has been and is guilty of unjustified acts.  History books, as in the past, will leave out the ugly truth and include the glorified lie.

===message:It is very east to sit back and read about something that happened 100 years or 1 year ago and say it was unjustified when you know the outcome, and the after shocks of an act.  Every race and every country has done things that they should not be proud about, however as far as leaving out ugly truths in history, History is left up to perception, and interpretation, different historians will tell the tale differently.
