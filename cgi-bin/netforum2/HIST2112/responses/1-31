===message:I think you're right on all counts.  Americans were not just insensitive and discriminative towards the Chinese but the Irish as well.  I believe in the cartoon with Foo Manchu, the caption was "embrace America" where he was hugging a whiskey bottle it was a direct insult to the Irish.  Kearney, however, was too ignorant to realize that he was being insulted.
