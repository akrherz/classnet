===message:Brenda Miller, I TOTALLY agree with everything you said about Americans being a generally spoiled people.  We want what we want, when we want it, and how we want it.  We are so quick to put others down for things they may be willing to do that we aren't and we assume they are wrong for doing them.  The Chinese Exclusion is a prime example.  Because the Americans in the 19th century were only willing to work for a set wage and nothing lower, they looked down on the Chinese who were willing to work for much lower wages to get the same job done.  Instead of competing with other countries/people, we should all be able to come together to accomplish one common goal!

===message:Are Americans any more "spoiled" then other prosperoius countries such as Sweden or France.  To say that we do not welcome immigrants warmly is not the case our country has opened it's boarders to those that wish to come to our country legally, and have public assistace to help them in their endevour.  How many other countries can say that?  In Sweden if you are not a citizen either by birth or marriage you are not able to purchase real estate directly.  THe United States has never put such stipulations on the purchase of our property.  Is it so much ot ask that if you choose to live in this country that you speak our language, and live by the same laws then natural born citizens do.  It is my opinion that the Chinese were discriminated aganist because they were willing to work for less money and work longer hours because it still provided a better living for them then if they were in their native country.

===message:Karissa, it is true that the American society isn’t the only nation that can be viewed as being spoiled.  In this discussion I would have to attest though that the American’s at this time period were spoiled, because they were getting use to a capitalist society with a steady job and income and believing that their every need should be met.  During the depressions in the late 1800s, this steady job flow was challenged.  I think that the American society can be viewed as spoiled, because they didn’t take the initiative at being hard workers, in comparison to the Chinese or other immigrants of that time period.   I don’t think in this discussion it was meant that American’s are just spoiled as a way of defining us, but because we are a society based on meeting our needs and desires.  That is what a capitalist society is all about right?  As a capitalist nation it can be said that that the people are always having the urge to purchase the sweetest and newest thing on the market.  We have this feeling of being able to get what we want, when we want it.  Without money this is difficult to attain.  Without a job, we have no moeny.  It is true that America has had its borders opened for hundreds of years and has rarely put up restrictions as harsh as the Chinese Exclusion.  I do believe also that the Chinese were discriminated against because of their hard working abilities and at low wages.  All in all, this was a time period when immigrants were looked down upon, because they took job positions where citizen of the U.S. were finding it difficult to get work.
