===message:   Nice assessment Kim.  It is apparent from our reading and the photographs that the farmers and citizens of the agricultural society were desperate victims of the great depression.  With the loss of production there was no way to provide for the family and many people were in desperate situations.  The dust storms also worsened the tragedy by destroying what crops were grown and also destroying the soils.<br><br>  
   The presidents during the great depression tried to alleviate the deprived situation for the farming communities in different ways.  Months before the crash, Hoover enacted the Agricultural Marketing Act in 1929.  This legislation allowed the government to purchase any excess produce and distribute it efficiently throughout the nation.  This act also transferred 500 million dollars in federal loans to help assist the farmers.  Eventually though, the prices of crops feel so dramatically that the government wasn’t able to afford purchasing any more.  Not much was offered under the Hoover administration, and that is a major reason why the American people elected the new democratic president Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Roosevelt pushed for many reform and social programs to help stabilize the economy.<br><br> 
   One of the major New Deal programs that were developed to help the farmers was the Tennessee Valley Authority.  This program was very successful in that it built many dams that would help control flooding and create reservoirs for irrigation.  The dams also provided for hydroelectric power for some of the farming communities in the region.  With the introduction of electricity in these areas, new industries were also able to be build and this allowed some of the unemployed farmers work in different areas.  This program was helpful, but it was strictly located in the Tennessee and North Carolina area, therefore the Midwestern states did not benefit at all from this program.  As mentioned in Kim's posting and my original posting, the FSA camps allowed farmers a new chance at life in the Midwest.<br><br>  
   The great depression was a horrible time for many Americans, but it was very devastating most to the poor individuals such as the common laborer and crop farmer.  Even though legislation and programs were created to help with the dire situation, there were still many people who were unaffected and hurting during this time.  It truly was a though time for America.

===message:The strength that these people had to try to rebuild themselves and survive was remarkable. The government did try to save these people.  I think that you made a good point about this.

===message:I agree, the strength that these families showed was astonishing.  To lose everything and still move forward must be a huge challenge. I look at the pictures of the camps and see little storage sheds, but these people probably considered them as wonderful blessings.  It's almost sinful the things that we now take for granted.

===message:I believe that the contrasting photographs depict the effects of the Depression from two opposite ends of the  spectrum.  Obviously, the people that were not as negatively impacted (such as the wealthy elite) didn't see particular hardships such as lacking the basic essentials of life such as food, clothing, and shelter.

===message:Kim, I agree with your analysis of those 2 sets of photographs.  The contrast is so amazing between the people being extremely poor to being well-cared for.  Just the fact that the President paid people to take “staged” photographs shows how much he wanted to show the whole world that the government had taken care of the “common people”.  I also thought these photos were candid shots, especially those taken of the Dust Bowl.  I love to take photographs and many that are taken candid just do not turn out as well as those were you ask the subjects to pose or show them how to stand for the best effect. Photographers such as Lange were experts at this concept and the excellent, dramatic resulting photographs bring this to bear.
