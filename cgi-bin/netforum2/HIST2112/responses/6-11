===message:I disagree with you Stephanie, because after the war and after being suppressed for so many years, moving from the South was a big part of the African-Americans's way of saying goodbye to the oppression and let's make something of our selfs.  Let's leave and find a better life for us.  I think that if they had stayed in the South with all constant lynching that was occuring at the time, for them to stay there would have been to give up themselves completely.  As they moved North and showed what they could do, displayed their talents so openly and to be accepted or partially accepted was a big step for the New Negro, as they developed and evolved and new leaders started to arrise and led them to the Civil Rights movement.  Rome was not invented in one day.  And, Yes, if they had tried to claim the Civil Rights in the 1920's, they would have not been victorious, but, in a way that was a little step that moved them closer to their goal.

===message:I agree with Carmen....progress is made in baby steps and the 1920's were a time of independence.  African Americans were celebrating themselves and their culture, but they probably did not feel strong enough to attempt anything like the civil rights movement.  The Harlem Renaissance was a stepping stone to greater things to come.

===message:I disagree with your comment about "jungle music" being the music of apes. Since blacks were taken from the jungles of Africa, "jungle music" makes more since in that context. I don't know of any apes that listen to music.

===message:Ok Stephanie, I totally agree with you.  Your perception of the subject has shone through even though you "could not really say what it meant to be black at that time". You have expressed enough empathy to really comprehend the basics of what it meant to be black at that time.  Thank you. I wish more people would put forth just a fraction of the same empathy.
