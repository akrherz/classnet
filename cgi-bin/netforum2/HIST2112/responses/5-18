===message:I agree that the easiest outlets to blame for the disarray of the U.S. were immigrants, etc., and that this definitely helped lead to a resurgence in membership in the K.K.K.  I do not agree that Evans was just against “immigrants that came from communist locations”.

I think that Evans was totally against any non-whites, regardless of where they came from.

===message:Evans was seemingly pointing out the stereo types of this Society. I think in the image he showed a little remorse toward immagrants. If you were not born in America for one you would'nt be considered American even if you got a green card. If you were born in America and you're ethnic is not an American back ground. In criticizing some of the European countries, He expresses his opinion of hte Red Scare.
