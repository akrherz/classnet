===message:The immigrants came to this country with an attitude that much difference than what American were use to dealing with. American felt threaten by their hard work and culture difference. What it really amounted to be prejudice not only against individual, but also against a race of people? American felt by accepting the Chinese people they would lose part of what they had established as a nation to people that thought to be lazy and incompetent. New laws were made to target only the Chinese because of their work ethics. The worked log hours on job American refuse to work and they would work for lower pay. Moreover, the Chinese culture was difference than American. They wanted to maintain their heritages something the American wanted them to forget by Americanize them.
