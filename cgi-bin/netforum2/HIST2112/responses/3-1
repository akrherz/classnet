===message:I think the unions were definitely the "Losers" in that case.  The power of the company to create an atmosphere of "family" either through real concern or by intimidation and monopoly is the challenge for unions.  The larger unions are as intimidating to workers as the company "management".  Many people fear unions and joining unions b/c they want to have a say in how their company is treating them and the unions seem to take that power away.  The union rep may not have the individual's best interest at heart.

===message:I think Americans oppose unions because it is absolutely impossible to get everyone to agree on the same issues. Someone may be a member of a union, but like Chrisi said, what happens when the union decides to strike and some of the members cannot afford to do so, or they disagree with the reasons for the strike. Then what? As far as unions having an advantage over non-uninon workers, if a change is made in a company due to a union strike the change would apply to all workers not just those who are part of the union.

===message:I definitely agree with you on the fact that the union was the Loser in that case.  Unions do take away from the individual, they become managed beyond their control as long as they remain active in the union.
