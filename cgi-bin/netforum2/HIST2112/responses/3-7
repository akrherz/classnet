===message:It is true that these two radicals had anarchist views and wanted something to happen, and they certainly had beliefs that got the attention of the country.  It seems to me at the very most these two young Russians were just getting by economically, working that small ice cream parlor in Worchester, MA.  Alongside other individuals in America, there were many people who wanted some kind of reform to take place, which would give the laborers more control over the industry.  The election of a Socialist in the state of New York was one interesting sign that the people were willing to vote in new types leaders to start a reform.  If the path to reform was the eventual socialistic system, then Goldman and Berkman were willing support the cause.  Their open support of the Homestead Strike and the attempted assassination upon Frick, demonstrated they were willing to pay the consequences for taking drastic measures to change the system.  These two characters were some who took matters to the extreme, and even got evicted from the United States for their beliefs.  This story proves that these two individuals were willing to go to whatever necessary to have their ideas heard, even if it was against the political and legal system of the U.S.

Unions definately seem to take as you said the "hard ball" approach when arguing rights for the union workers who sometimes don't always agree with the point that the union is fighting for...and as you stated the end result is often times the union workers lose their jobs. It seems like a no-win situation for the union worker. The union is supposed to protect the interest of the worker, but it appears that often times the union is no more concerned with the worker's benefits than the employer is.

===message:I also agree with you on this point.  The union does seem to create more problems than solutions for the worker.  I think that is another reason that Americans views unions as undesirable.  Yes, everyone would like something different with their jobs, but creating conflict usually ends up with the termination of that job.

===message:Remember, American Wasn’t always anti-union. The government also helped support big business by passing laws to weaken the unions. Another thing that hurt the union was the lost of so many jobs because of the strikes. People needed way to feed their family and pay their bills. As American began to see the strength of the unions decline they were less likely to join a union. But, many people still believed in the strength of the union such as, the United Auto Workers. Sometime the strength of the union can bring a bargaining chip to the table when it represents so many people like the UAW.

===message:I agree that the when union workers lose their jobs because of struggle between the union and employers, that is not a good thing.  I think some unions can be good. They keep employers from taking advantage of employees.  And if union members are laid off, there is unemployment insurance to help defray expenses.  There is also a department that helps workers find another job.  If there were more unions, I know there would be higher wages for all across the board.
