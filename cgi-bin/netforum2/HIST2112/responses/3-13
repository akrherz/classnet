===message:Kim, I agree with your assessment about anarchy.  However, I'm not so sure that the Big Brother analogy fits for me.  Big Brother was about manipulating and controlling.  The power of unions isn't all corrupt (like some movies depict) and often are extremely beneficial (like other movies depict-such as "Norma Rae").  In cases like the textile industry and some of the more dangerous workplaces like coalmining and steelworkers, the unions brought great sweeping changes for the good in terms of working conditions and wage equality etc.

===message:Not only Americans have freedom of speach, but we use it too.  A Union is expensive, time consuming and, it really causes a lot of trouble, in most cases.  When the company that you work for has a union, you do not have a choice, because if you choose not to be in the union than you become uninsured and the employer can do anything to you because you are not part of the union.  And you will have to leave your job because the other employees who are part of the union will not make it easy for you.

===message:In college my husband worked part time for UPS.  Out of his first pay check came his first dues to the teamsters.  Did he get any warning, any handbook, any introduction to the union.....NO!  You paid your dues and you shut up about it because that's the way it was.  Part time employees were paid very well, had one of the best insurance policies in the nation and some of the best perks, but was that enough...no.  They went on stike for new back supports, new rules for shoes, etc.  We were punished everytime because my husband was out of work.  The union did not care that you couldn't pay your mortage or that you were willing to buy your own tax-duductible supplies, they wanted to WIN!  Unions had their place...but now they are out of control.
