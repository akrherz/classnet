===message:I must agree with you in part, but I do not think they are heathens. Chinese are just naturally born hard working people and they know how to survive.  As I was reading the quote by Rudgard Kipling, chinese life style is somewhat like the egyptian.  When Isreal was delivered out of the hands of Pharo, they thought their life would be all peaches and cream.  However, as they wondered in the wildnes they found out that there were still obstickles in their way.  That is why the chinaman do not complain about their work and how people treat the because they have come a long way from where they used to be, and they have a tremendous amount of things to be thankful for.
