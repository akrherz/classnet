===message:I looked at the picture of the dragon in the opposite direction.  When I first looked at this picture I thoguht it was a dragon spitting out all the peoples that Hiram thoguht would never blend with the American people.  Since the title of his speech was "The Menace of Modern Migration" I just felt that these people were migrating from the dragon.  The dragon in the picture could be looked upon as people coming from pre-modern lands or just the individuals Hiram spoke against.  I don't think there is a right or wrong way to read this picture, since it is art everyone has a different perception on it.

===message:I think the dragon consuming people represent what he considers "race suicide" and if not carful Anglo stock would be out bred by the immigrants and thus "mongrelize" and "pollute" the American "stock".  Then he goes on to elaborate and justify his perspective using the stereo-types used in the cartoons during the "Red Scare".

===message:I agree with your descriptions of the cartoon illustrations...at first I thought the very same thing regarding the dragon picture in "The Menace of Modern Immigration" The dragon represents the "non-true Americans" that are swallowing up the "true Americans" causing Evans' fear of the true Anglo-Saxan Americans to eventually be swallowed up and disappeared. However, after examining the same illustration I believe that the dragon picture may be portraying the dragon as the "true Americans" being a strong powerful creature trying to rid the "non-true Americans" It's so hard to understand Evans' points and thoughts...it is all so crazy!!!

===message:Jordan, good perception.  I didn't see the dragon picture that way at all, but I can see it now.  Good point.  You're right, no two people see things the same very often.

===message:You represent a good point about the dragon.  At first that was my thoughts that the dragon was the Americans.  But after reading Evans' speech, I would have to say that I am still confused that it could be taken either way, also.  Either way Evans' thought that evil would destroy America.
