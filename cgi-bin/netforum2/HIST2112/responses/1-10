===message:I agree.  If it was not for the immigrants, nobody would be building houses, or fixing your roofs, or fixing your cars, etc.  The point is that without the immigrants this Country would not be as advanced and profitable as it is today.  It was because of them back in the 19th century that the Country was able to rise above the depresion it was facing, while the Americans kept looking for a way to get rid of them.  As humans, we have to learn to work together, because our troops composed of many different backgrounds and countries, are fighting toghether, YES, Immigrants to, are fighting for you to defend the Great United States of America.
