===message:Jordan, nice book!(not screaming, emphatic) I enjoy reading your analysese, as I have stated before. I can see your interpretation of the photos and I concur.  Didn't the text say that the pictures of the Dust Bowl were posed and not candid?  I know what you were saying in that the Photographers wanted America to see the truth.  I believe that's why he posed them.  Still, devestatingly impacting.

===message:Oops, your right Kim.  I did say candid, but my definition of that was meant for a truth describing picture.  I do remember from reading the text that the pictures were posed and everything in the pictures were arranged and put together.  Good eye at catching how my words might be misinterpretated.  Thanks for the response!

===message:You made an excellent observation about these times.  I also have to agree with Connie that we have never had to experience anything like this.  I do not think that we can even truly imagine what it must have been like.

===message:I agree that the “FSA wanted accurate…pictures, to show how their camps… were relieving poverty stricken citizens”.  I think that Hoover was trying to ignore the dire situation of most Americans and did nothing to help them. He was, as you stated, one of the “extremely wealthy individuals” who were not threatened personally by this economic crisis. President Roosevelt stepped in with these camps and did truly help out the migrant workers and farmers.  The shots taken by Lange and Rothstein, however, were not candid shots.  They were staged, but still accurately reflected the depressed state of rural American during this time. Your analyzation of the photographs was enjoyable and accurate.

===message:The one picture that hit home with me was the pic of the sharecropper family outside that was evicted from their home by their landowner. I couldnt imagine having to live in those times. Those people were strong. What was their motivation? The Dust Bowl was a devastating event. Despite these hard times their pressed their way on. This picture definitely speaks a thousand words
