===message:But, don't you see?  That's precisely the point!  The U.S. wants something and will go after at whatever the cost, but under the guise of education, liberation, or uplifting.  The U.S. has never helped a people simply because they needed helping but, there was always something in it for our country whether it be trade ports, cheaper imports and exports, or natural resources.  Large American companies today are contracting work in other countries and paying the employees approximately one-third or less what American employees are paid.  They don't do this because those countries need the jobs but because it saves the American companies millions daily.  So because we established a presence in the Phillippines before WWII under auspicious pretenses is the reason the Far East ports were such a help during the war.  And believe me, WWII was a discussion topic even before we were in the Phillippines.  America may have underestimated it slightly but it had been "run up the flagpole".
