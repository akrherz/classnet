===message:I believe that what you said about Rockwell was very interesting.  His work reflected the America as Americans saw it, the dream.  The way that America should be.  He for the most part, did not include anyone but white people in his paintings.

===message:I agree with the fact that propaganda is used to create fear and urgency in a person. Norman Rockwell's illustrations captured what White America was willing to preserve. However Rockwell's ideas did not pass down to other races. In fact, one could argue that its only what you can do if you are white. Pretty much excludes all others from the ideal "American" life.

===message:C. Lucas,
  I guess your whole comment may have been included in your reply to Trisha.  So, you think that only white people received the message that Rockwell conveyed in his paintings?  Do you really think that all of the other races in America felt excluded from these ideals?  I am truly interested in your opinion.  I am still formulating mine, but as of now I would think that anyone in America may have accepted these as the total American Ideal (even though most did not live as well as the paintings dipicted) only because all of the advertisements had white people in them.  There were rarely any advertisements or publicized paintings that included different races, don't you think?  Even today, most of the media is still inundated with "white" people.  Everyone was used to seeing white people in magazines and billboards etc. Don't know, just a thought.  Reply if you have time.

===message:I totally believe that the Rockwell images as well as advertisements in that period were geared towards whites. I'm sure I will receive a lot of flack for this comment, but I feel that the cause of this is because of economical reasons. White's had more buying power thus the reason for white representation. As races have been able to acheive equal buying power, the more "integration" of commercials, etc. Then again, times have changed and companies want to have a good appearance buy not just using white actors and models.

===message:I thought your comment on Rockwell “selling” the American dream to be pretty accurate.  Advertising and propaganda can go hand in hand, in the fact that they both are used to gain something or get attention.  With advertising you want to sell an idea.  Propaganda in this case was used to celebrate American values or a way of life.  It does appear as if Rockwell was trying to use both of these measures to gain the interest of the public.  By advertising these messages he could sell the idea that Americans had a full dinner table, had the freedom from want, and also could feel safe while sleeping at night.  If Americans bought into this dream, they of course would have to start practicing these four freedoms.  As you said Rockwell probably did leave out every group but whites, because the white population was the ones with the purchasing powers.  The goal from this perspective was to get the white population to believe in this American dream and start living life as it depicted.  This would of course help gain support for the war, as Americans fought overseas for causes the general public had no knowledge about.

===message:I disagree that Rockwell showed “classic Americana”. Rockwell just showed middle-class white people and the things they did in everyday life.  America was built on diversity and variety in race and ethnic origin.  Rockwell pictures none of these things.  He left out Asians, Germans, Poles, Mexicans, African-Americans, and women in leadership roles.  I’m sorry, but Rockwell did not show any of the things that MY relatives experienced during his time. He could have, but chose not to.  It’s not like he didn’t see “Whites Only” signs posted everywhere he went, from restaurants to hotels to street cars and trains..  He did not show lynchings, burning of homes of immigrants, beatings, rapes, murders, hard economical times, hunger and need.  That is MY “classic Americana”, and for most poor, non-whites. For not using his gift to speak out against such things, he is forever guilty of DENIAL.  His long legacy of pictures condemns him.
