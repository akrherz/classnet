===message:What language could a US pres know that would be useful? Bush spoke excellent Spanish. However,
remember taht it is dangerous to use another language in
official business unless you are totally fluent. Otherwise
you might make a horrible mistake with earth shaking results.
Also it is good that we can all communicate isn't it? If English is
de facto the language so be it. Chinese is much too difficult to be a workd
language. French was when they were a big world power. So, yes
it does depend on power and influence. If the US falls apart someone
else will likely lick up the global leardership.
