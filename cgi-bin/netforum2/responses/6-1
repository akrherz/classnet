===message:I like your arguments re English. You are correct that there
is a commercial and life style connection to English.

That's really all we mean when we say that English is
the world language. Most people who want to be successful have always
studied "other" lanmguages. Now they study English instead
of, say Latin during the Roman Empire, or German during the 
powerful rule of Austro-Hungarian Empire, or Spansih during the
colonian times of Spain.

===message:Due to the current economic power of the U.S., I agree that 
English has become a sort of universal language.  It seems 
that in many of the non-English countries I have visited one
can almost always find someone who speaks some English.

The developing countries who want tourism and trade with the
U.S. realize it is to their advantage to promote English as
a second language for their population.  People in the U.S. are
rather ethnocentric and many do not feel the need to learn 
a second language.  'If the world wants to do business with
the U.S., they should learn English.'  This scenario could change
in the future if the hispanic minority in the U.S. countinues
to grow and the Latin American countries in Central and South
America 'takeoff' economically.  We may have to change our 
thinking.
