===message:    You must realize also that people who are found with 
evidence on them proving their guilt (i.e. a dead body or a 
murder weapon with their prints on it) are getting off on 
technicalities. People are constantly talking about rights
yet the rights of criminals seem to be more important than 
those of the victim, whose rights the criminal violated in 
the first place. Two rights don't make a wrong, but criminals
are literally getting away with murder because we want to 
protect their rights. Maybe it's about time we limit a few
personal rights in order to better serve the people as a 
whole.
