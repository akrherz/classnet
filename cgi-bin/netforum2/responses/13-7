===message:Interesting comments. There are no UGLY people ! It's all in the eyes of the beholder.  I wrote elsewhere on diversity "The difficulty with diversity is that the institutions of government, as you said, have to be suited for promoting and supporting stable, non-violent diversity.The ability to find leaders who are willing to bring people together and will use their moral power to do so is essential. Without that, diversity can truly be a disaster."

In the case of the US, diversity has generally gradually chaged the look of society. It's when the existing equilibrium is challenged by a flood that people get nervous. There is also an American rule that immigrants should want to learn English and become citizens quickly. Some of the policies of the 1970's and early 80's and some of the apparent resistance to this by "multiculturalists" has also made people in the "middle-majority" feel angry. That's where the immigration backlash comes from.
