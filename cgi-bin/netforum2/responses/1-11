I completely agree with you.Look at the Frisians.They have 
like the Romans conquered great parts of the world.Frisian
too is a world spoken language.Drachten, I believe can thus
be seen as the centre of the world(although it's not in the
position of owning a railway station).Even Bill Clinton, who
visited the Netherlands lately came to Friesland and admired.
Yes, we too have influenced a great part of the world.Even an 
Iowan boy is believed to come to Groningen(that's close enough
to Friesland).I look forward to your opinion about this.

===message:   I couldn't tell, was that statement about Latin and 
the Roman Empire supposed to be sarcastic? If it was not,
you should realize that the Romans had a very important
influence on the the modern world, that they did not just
leave as their mark on the world a bunch of ruins. I think
it's important to realize that 62% of the English language 
is either derived or directly taken from Latin, and that the
Romans were responsible for developing and honing most modern
forms of government just to name a few of their influences on 
modern culture. The fact that they are still a major influence
1500 years after their fall is pretty impressive. However, 
what worries me is, as the modern equivalent of the Roman 
Empire, what will be left to remind our descendants of America 
1500 years from now?
