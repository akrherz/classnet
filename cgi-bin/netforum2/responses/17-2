Of course there are laws (immigration, drug, etc) with  which one should be in compliance.

People who claim they are Iowa residents but are not must pay out of state tuition.

Non-citizens cannot vote.

In the past this prop would not have been necessary because the state generally didn't provide much in terms of health and other services.

I agree kids should not be pawns and sick people should not be left untreated.
