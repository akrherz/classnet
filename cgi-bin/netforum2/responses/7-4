===message:I do believe in the Gaia theory.  Even though the world may
seem to be becoming over populated, I think that once the earth
reaches its "breaking" point, then nature(Gaia) will unleash
it's fury and dispose of the weak.  Disease and famine have 
already started wipeing out people on the other side of the
earth.  Eventually, after time, the other side of the earth
will be fertile ground for habitation where as we (Americans) 
will have exahusted our resources. It's sort of like leaving
half of a farm alone so that it can replenish itself through nature
and time.  The other half of the farm you work until it is
no longer useful.

===message:  If anything the fact that these families are being motivated
to destroy their female offspring could in fact support the 
Gaia theory. These individuals are eliminating the number
of fertile child-bearing females of the next generation, 
thus limiting the number of reproducing individuals in the 
second generation who will probably desire male offspring 
just as much as their predecessors and in turn destroy their
own female offspring, therefore reducing the possible number
of surviving and child bearing females of the third
generation. And before you know it, you have negative 
population growth and Gaia has limited human population growth
without having to resort to any cruel or painful means of
doing so.
