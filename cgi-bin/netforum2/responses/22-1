===message:Many countries can't defend themselves because of too few people, too much of an infrastructure shortage, etc. The U.S. also likes to play a big role and serve as a defense shield for its allies or interests. It's like a division of labor.

The Islamic countries all have people who hate the U.S. some but some find it  an importnat partner and in many the elites and the average person may differ in their views of the U.S. so there is a division of the culture as well.
