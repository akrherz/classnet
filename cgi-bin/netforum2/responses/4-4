If you think about it, the history of the world is
really just the history of people, countries, empires,
and governments encroaching on other people (colonialism?).

If you prtefer "untouched" or isolated ancient cultures then so
be it. But most places in the world for better or worse are
an amalgam of cultures - we are all mongroles!
