===message:     The violence that is occurs between different ethic, 
religious, etc. groups usually isn't the product of the 
people's making, leaders, individuals are who sow the seeds of 
tension and distrust for others, directing and spreading hate
for specific groups. I honestly do not believe that any one
group of people would on their own decide to attack another.
Leaders are using mob mentality and fear as a tool to achieve
their own goals and bids for increased power. They are 
exploiting the baser aspect of human nature, greed, envy, hate,
to accumulate power for themselves.
