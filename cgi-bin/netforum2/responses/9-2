===message:    Maybe it's part of America's problem that we're too
accepting of social problems like adultery. I not saying 
that we should publicly stone people for commiting such 
acts, but SOMETHING should be done. There is something really
wrong with this country that its priority isn't on the family.
Everyone talks about "family values", but what is really done
to promote them? Most of our social problems stem from 
problems within the family. Responsible and considerate
citizens are the product of a responsible and considerate
households. Values are taught over a lifetime, not suddenly
aquired at legal voting age. People seem to take it for
granted that acts like adultery, though not condoned, are an
acceptable alternative to actually dealing with one's marrital
problems. Not only are these people hurting there spouse, but 
through their actions they're sending a message to their
children that immorality is an acceptable option.
