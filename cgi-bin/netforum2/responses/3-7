is and will always be controversial to different cultures but
there should be an universal understanding that everybody has
the "right" to agree to disagree.  I learned about a lot of
ethical concepts through Philosophy 230 and Anthropology
class.  One thing that I am sure of is that certain cultures are not required to practice the same beliefs as another culture but rather to be tolerant of the beliefs of another culture.  I think that people should sometimes let knowledge outweigh religion for the safety of its people.  For instance; female circumcision is dangerous to the health because of infection.  In this case I would think that the cons outweigh the pros.  Cultures that perform this would probably disagree because they feel they are keeping the "unwanted" population down, and more of their people are not living in "sin." Everything will always be a matter of opinion.  Differences is what makes this world so mysterious and exciting.  Who really is to say what is right, wrong, moral, and immoral?  I don't think any one person or group of this world could say they have the right to judge.  As far as wanting everyone to practice the same beliefs, and have the same morals, why would anyone want to be the same as someone else.  If that was the case, yes we would still all look different but we would all act the same.
