===message:This is a really tough issue.

I would prefer politicians, soldiers, and everyone else to
separate out personal life choices and behavior from
public scrutiny. Sex and sexual attraction are a very powerful
force in the life of the human species (as it true of all living things plants and animals included). You can
look that up. It seems as though, in the 1990's, we are saying
that people who are physically attracted to each other must,
under all circumstances and under all situations, keep their
hands off each other!
Is that doable? Is that realistic given the nature of such
attraction? Is it NECESSARY to pry people apart for them
to be able to discharge their work effectively? Does it really
affect Pres. Clinton's ability to lead what he does after hours
and with whom?

The 1990's are a very trying time because the answer to
these questions is judged by whether the two (or three and more) 
parties to such encounters are willing and free participants in  the
relationship or whether there is real coercion on one of the
parties. Starting with rape which is not permissible and must
be harshly punished, you go on a continuum of less and less
coercion until, at some point, it becomes a consensual affair.
I believe that it would be smart in the military if the rules
were changed so that this point (i.e. when a relationship is concensual
and truly voluntary on both parties) is identified and personnel are not 
destroyed when they really want, mutually, to engage with each other.

(Words of wisdom from Dr. Politics who has discussed this on his radio program several times)

===message: I think it's important to realize that individuals in the 
military are just as suseptable to weakness and indiscretions
as anyone else, however they have chosen a life style that 
demands more of them then just a nine to five commitment. In
the military you are a soldier twenty-four hours a day, not 
just while you are on the job. Most especially for officers,
you are setting an example for both your fellow enlisted 
people as well as the public. The military is like your older 
brother, he is expected by your parents (the government) to
leed a lifestyle, at least outwardly, that sets an a good 
example for younger siblings (us, the public). 
   I think that it's absolutely disgusting that Americans no 
longer expect exemplary behavior from their public servants, 
and that is exactly what the military is. They are there to 
serve and protect the American people. Standards of behavior 
have gone down the toilet in this country, children cursing 
in school, public officials having blatant sexual 
indiscretions, just to name a few.
