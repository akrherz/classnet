===message:I think it is depressing but I believe that the United States
really is the "BIG BULLY."  I think that because we got the
bombs and the weapons, a huge country, and a good sense of 
nationalism, other countries strive to either be like us or
try to whip our butts.  We are a well developed country with
many flaws.  Our crime is tremendously high per capita.  Our
domestic problems seem to be a lot bigger since we decided
that we are so powerful that we can butt into everybody's
problems.  Homelessness is astronomical.  Unemployment is
still bad although it has improved.  Why else would other
countries want to adopt our language if we weren't the "big bully."  They almost have to because of our huge market requires countries that want to buy or trade products to adapt to us, not the other way around.
Yes, the whole world revolves around us for the wrong reasons.  People get along with the United States because they are obligated to, not because they want to.  Is this wrong?  You are darn right.  Some day when all these countries that we whipped develops enough to stand on there own, we will find ourselves in the middle of World War 3 with nobody to back us up because we couldn't keep to ourselves.  Instead we put our heads where they didn't belong; up someone else's butt.
