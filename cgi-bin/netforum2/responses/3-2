===message:The question of who owns what and how we enforce property rights is complex. The big and powerful seem to always
be able top beat out the little guy. 
On the other hand competition means you are always trying to 
improve on the other guy (bigger, Better, chaeper) etc.

===message:<pre>    Drug companies are NOT creating and distributing these 
medications "for the betterment of mankind". They are doing
it purely for profit. The fact that what they are doing may 
be helping someone is only a side benefit. Take for example
organ recipients. Once they receive their live-prolonging 
organ, surprise! They are confronted with the fact that for
the rest of their lives they will be taking medications daily,
prescriptions which cost approximately $400-600 dollars per
month. 
    THe the posibility of some other company coming along 
and making your product and distributing it at a lower cost 
is not likely. Companies patent drugs just like any other 
creation. A single drug company can hold the sole distribution 
rights on a drug for great lengths of time (I'm not quite sure 
of the exact amount of time, but it's several years) and even 
renew those patents when the original time frame is expended.
This means that there is literally no competition and they 
can and do charge the consumer anything they want. The  
comsumer has no options. On new medications, drug companies
often charge several times more than the drug's actual
fabrication price. Now is that ethical? Robbing those that 
have no other choice, buy or die.       </pre>
