===message:I don't think population is a problem.  I agree that diseases
are controlling the population in "other countries".  AIDS is
certainly a problem.  In more advanced societies, using the U.S.
as an example, married couples are having fewer children and more
people are staying single.  In the end I feel it is all balancing
out.
