===message:    Also with jobs at such places as IPB meat packing (just as
an example, I have nothing against IBP specifically), you're
looking at a job where the environment isn't very safe (my 
brother worked there for a year and there was at least one
knifing a month), on the cutting floor your job causes 
repetitive movement problems like carpel tunnel (I have no 
idea how to spell that), and finally its just disgusting. 
    Americans seem to be under the impression that they are
intitled to a good job that pays ten to twenty bucks an hour
and keeps them entertained, as if manual labor is beneath 
them. Illegal immagrants and foreign based factories wouldn't
be in such high demand if Americans were more concerned with
making an honest living earning their own money, rather than
accepting government handouts because they can't find a job 
that meets their overblown expectations.
