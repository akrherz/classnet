===message:Well that's a huge discussion and very complex all right!

Ethics is relative - yes   no? Ethics is (are) universal - yes, no? Is emplying children unethical (after all, in most countries they work all day for nothing and get beaten by their parents if they slack off). So is it an idealized, Western, high income value that kids should not work? Kids working in Nike factories often bring home more than all the other family members put together. Good or bad? If products are made by $20 an hour workers they get so expensive no one wants to buy them so there is a consumer issue as well (except in Socialist - communist states).

go figure!

===message:   You mentioned that if a person was still able to look at 
themselves, that their decisions were ethical enough, but I 
strongly disagree. People have the ability to close their 
eyes to injustices that occur right in front of them, to 
become desensitized to the suffering of their fellow man. 
The only reason that people are able to do nothing, to ignore 
the suffering of others is because they are able to convince
themselves that there is no connection between themselves and
this other person. Because this other persons suffering has 
no direct affect on our own lives, we feel that we don't need
to take action, that the problem will resolve itself or that 
someone else will get involved. Take for example domestic 
violence or child abuse. Every day, neighbors, supposed
friends are aware of violence taking place in someone they
knows household, but because they either feel that it isn't 
their place to interfer with another family's problems or 
because they are simply able to ignore it these things are 
able to continue unabated. We talk about a "global village",
and yet how can we be involved and participate in the global
village  and its problems when we are unwilling or unable to 
participate in our own neighborhoods or communities?
