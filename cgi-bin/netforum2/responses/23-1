===message:Equal rights? What in the world does that have to do with this? I don't think the cultures that practice this do it in the name of equal rights. Also, there is no comparison between male circumcision and female genital mutilation. The only point I will concede is the cultural one. However, I still think the procedure should be banned.

===message:Circumcision is generally a public health procedure to reduce male infection. It has some religious links but with the medical or sanitary goal. Female surgery is to reduce or destroy sexual pleasure, to prevent girls and women from having intercourse and it is a very painful and brutal prcedure which has a lot to do with maintaining women's place as subordinate people in the societies where it's practiced. That is not the case with male circumcision. Cultural yes. But I also object to slavery and torture where these are still practiced. it has to do with the natural rights of all human beings as premised in the idea of human dignity, freedom and self-respect. We are different. Cultures which supress and deny human dignity are wrong - unless we defend those principles we are relativists who may then accept anything as "OK" as long as a different group of peoplke demand it and claim that it's ok. I think we can reason about what's right and what's wrong. In other words I think there is such a thing as right and wrong.
