===message:Most cynical people see everything as stupid! Also, even HS students are smart and can see that diversity has many challenges and many risks - they see the black and Latino and White (and Asian) kids hanging together separately. They experience group think by students (druggies, nerds, jocks etc.) and so diversity or difference is something that students know and feel. And,..... it is actually a quite important part of peoples life. So some assembly that masks the difficulties and says we should all love one another may seem cynical and not real-worlds.
By the way ....have you had discussion groups on-line like this in HS.? Do you find it useful and/or interesting or not?
