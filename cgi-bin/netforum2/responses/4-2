The ability of a people (or nation) to defend and
protect itself against cultural, military, and economic imperialism is itself a measure of the significance anmd viability of a society in a global world.

does that make any sense?

In other words, coping with external threats
is one of the challenges and obligations of govt.  (and has always been one of
the primary functrions of govt. since cave days).

one can't whine about "those nasty, big bullies who came here and ruined our place and should not have done so".

Big bullies always do so and one must prepare to defend against them!
