===message:    I disagree with your statement that Nationalism is 
something to be fought. Though like most things, if taken to 
extremes, nationalism can be dangerous, it is important to 
realize it is also a means of unity. Nationalism is exactly 
what ties together such diverse places and peoples as Iowans
and Louisianans(?). Though you and I may not have much in 
common with a Union worker in Missouri or a stock broker on 
Wall Street, the fact that we're Americans and enjoy the 
rights and privileges of this country tie us together under
the banner of Nationalism. It's for this very reason that 
Nationalism is dangerous. Politicians have exploited this 
sense of unity as a means of seperating the people of a 
nation into "us and them."
