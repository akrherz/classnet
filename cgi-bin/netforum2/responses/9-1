===message:I believe that many American events are seen with disgust or horror in other cultures. Gay rights, rape, divorce, violence, drug use, death penalty, race relations. We are not very good at understanding how others see us but we are quick to look at others and criticize. As you said!

===message:I agree that other countries judge American culture on what 
see on television.  It is easy to blame the media for this.
But, ultimatly, it is our own fault for what the media 
broadcasts on television.  Americans are facinated with violence
and that rubs off on television.  Hollywood produces violent
movies, the local news leads off with how many people were
murdered, etc.  If our culture doesn't want to see this, then
the media would not report it.  If our media doesn't report this,
then other countries' news won't report it.

===message:It is not only what people want to see and hear.  It is the fact that the
U.S. has the freedom of speech.  Reporters can write and speak about 
whatever they feel is newsworthy.  Most of the time what the press feels
is important is all of the violence and crimes that are committed.  Not 
many people would have anything to talk about if it were not for what the
press reports.  Violence and crime are things that disgusts people and it
gives them something in common that they can talk about.
