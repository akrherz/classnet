===message:I found the lack of nationalism in Belarus to be the most intriguing aspect of Uri's presentation.  The lack of national identity which causes the people of Belarus to hope for reunification with Russia has implications for the subject of foreign direct investment.  Growth of foreign direct investment (in actual dollars) has grown tremendously in the past 5 years.  The majority of the investors behind this increase are private entities from the European Union and the United States.  Since risk is an integral part of any investment, the predominance of the pro-Russian sentiment in Belarus increases the risk of FDI in Belarus from the standpoint of the European/American businessperson.  Therefore, the lack of nationalism in Belarus contributes to its political instability, which decreases the likelihood of capital inflows from FDI. What can be done to empower the Belarusians to take responsibility for fighting poverty?

===message:Yes they need a lot of help and ideas, and moral support.

On the other hand that's the breaks - a people has to get their act together and find their own path.

Outsiders are sometimes resented so the world has to be careful lest it be rejected.
