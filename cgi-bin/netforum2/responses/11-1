ourselves.  I don't know anyone who calls themself a United Statean.
I much prefer to be called an American.  What part of Europe were you 
in?  There are many countries over there and they might not like to 
be called Europeans.  They might want to be called Spainards or Italians
if that was the country you happen to be in.

I don't know of anyone from Argentina who, when asked "where are you from" or "what are you" answers 

"I am an American from the Southern part"

She will say "I'm from Argentina".

It is just fiction that we are all Americans. When someone says in the Czech Republic "I love America" and "I want to go study in America" we all know what that person means. Relax. It's OK. Language has a life of its own.
