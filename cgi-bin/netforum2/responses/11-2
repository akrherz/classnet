===message:In case my comment didn't come through...Language is a very tricky business.  

When you say "American" or "I'm an American" or "the American way of Life" what does that mean to 89% of the people who hear it (even people in Japan, Colombia, or Belarus?). 
That's how language and concepts work not what things "should be" or how meaning "should be interpreted". Things mean what people undersstand them to mean now (not at some future date when the con cept has been redefined). 

In France they've tried to replace the word Computer which everyone
understands with some French gobble de gook
term that the Academy of language made up.
No one knows what it is. And surely no one
will use it (say it's L'appart electronique pur faire de
calculaciones et processe les mots" Get Real!.

===message:Most people in then world use American the same way. If U say "I'm an American.. " does that really mean "I'm a Maya Indian" or "I'm a Colombiano" to anyone?
