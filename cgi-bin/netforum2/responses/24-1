I do know that we need to cool off and work hard to be personally successful. Personal success by every American will lead to a better life and more tranquility for all. If you feel uncomfortabel don't go there would be an old saying that may have vailidity here. Mary Chapin Catt ! I love it! I think you mean Carrie Chapman! The other one is Carpenter isn't it?
