===message:Of Course, America is going to have a significant effect on the rest of the world.  A lot of countries are striving to be like us, while others believe that their route to economic success is by doing things as opposite from the United States system as possible.  I find it disheartening to know that our pop culture is what makes people throughout the world want to be like us.  I would prefer that other countries would want to be like us because of the way we handle our crime problems, or our innovative system of government.  But, our crime rates are astronomical, and our system of governmnet is one of the major things that have been criticized about our country.  Sadly there is one thing that does make us great, our pop culture.  We are the film and music powerhouse of the world.  We conform to all cultures so we can sell the most products. There isn't anything really special about most of our films and music.  I think the American ideal is what really makes our music and films special.  Everyone from other parts of the world has heard about America, "the land of the free."  They want to feel such a freedom that they never experienced before in their homeland.  They can feel our freedom and dreams in our music and film.  Pop Culture happens to be one of the United States strengths.  Every country has strengths and weaknesses.  Although I would prefer that other countries would look to the United States for things other than our pop culture and for "butting into other countries' business,"  being known so well for our pop culture isn't such a terrible thing.  Other than war, films and music are things that have a lasting impression in history.
