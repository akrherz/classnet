===message:I agree with part of this statement.  Our morals are based on how we
were raised but it is also about what is happening in our own life.
Take for example if a member of your family was seriously ill and the
only way you could cure them was by stealing the cure is it ethical to
steal.  This question has been raised by sociologists and nobody knows
how to really answer this question.  On one hand you may feel that it 
is wrong to steal but yet you feel compelled to help someone you love.
The excuses we use to determine if something is ethical or not is just
our judgement about how we feel and how it affects us personally.
