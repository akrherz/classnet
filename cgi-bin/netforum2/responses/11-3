===message:Good comments but ..... When you say "American" or "I'm an American" or "the American way of Life" what does that mean to 89% of the people who hear it (even people in Japan, Colombia, or Belarus?). That's how language and concepts work not what things "should be" or how meaning "should be interpreted". Things mean what people undersstand them to mean now (not at some future date when the con cept has been redefined). 

Good comments and thought provoking.
