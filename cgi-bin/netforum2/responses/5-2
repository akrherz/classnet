===message:I think that English should become the universal lang of the world.  The United States is the top financial country in the world, there are only a few countries the the world that do not do business with the U.S., these countries are small or wouldnt really make a big inpact on the U.S. economy.  I feel that most of the money passing is done directly with the U.S. and we need one or at least fewer different lang barriers to deal with.

===message:English is referred to as the universal language but I think a lot of times Americans take it for granted that everyone should speak english.  I also think that we should take into consideration that if other countries learn to speak english we should learn to speak at least one other language.  For instance, America has a huge spanish speaking population.  Maybe one of these days spanish will be considered our second language.  Something else that bothers me is when people are traveling to another country they don't even bother to learn simple words such as please or thank-you.  If another country holds us high enough to use our symbolism and looks up to us I think it shows a grave lack of respect to not learn at least a few phrases of their language when visiting their country.
