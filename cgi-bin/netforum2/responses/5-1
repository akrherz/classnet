===message:The idea of a Universal language is an interesting topic.
English is definitely used as that language in a lot of
instances.  Air traffic controlers and pilots around the 
world use English in the air.  If I'm not mistaken the same 
is true for international naval traffic.  In these cases 
it is crucial that everybody is speaking the same language.
If a jet from Toyko and a jet from New York arrive in Berlin
and there are three languages being spoken the possibilty of
a devastating wreck seems almost assured.  The loss of a 
native/traditional languange in opting for a universal 
spoken language would be tragic.  The individual and unique 
cultures around the world are so interesting.  I have not 
yet had the opertunity to be a world traveler, but when I 
do I am looking forward to being emersed into the foreign 
cultures and languages.  So I think the reason behind English
being the "Universal" language has a lot to do with English
domination at the crucial point of international 
developement that there needs to be some sort of unity 
in language in order to navigate the world safely and 
efficiently.

===message:English being the national language is very interesting topic.  In some part of Europe English is the second language for them.  I think the reason why was that America have so much economic power that other country like to learn and trade with us.  We the nation that exported so many things out into different countries that you would not believe.  By do this we have influence different parts of the world.  Other country like to known us more, because we are the country which is pretty young compare with other countries.  I have relative who live in France and they pretty much like only American stuff.  For example, like movies, clothes, and foods.  My cousin mentioned to me that a lot of kids now have American's name. 
The ironic thing about it is that in some part of California English was not spoken that much.  Like in Chinatown, most people speak chinese only.  Some can not speak English at all.
