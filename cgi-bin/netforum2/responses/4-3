I believe that how you assess colonialism all depends
on your perspective about who people and nations are.

If you believe in "purity" then you lament outside values.
If you believe or prefer "traditional, rural, pre industrial"
society then the industrial revolution and modernization
is bad.

Change is so relatively uncotrollable that I sometimes
wonder if it's all fate!
