===message:Yeah, me too Mike. I've used the resources listed in Moodle and I also use 2 other web sites, just to compare their forecasts with this one so I can get a good comparison. I have trouble with 13 also.  It is hard to predict all 3 pieces together. The front one is easy, but moisture with unstable is hard. I've been banking on the fact that if the cloud cover is heavy in the afternoon and gets heavier, then there's a pretty good chance that warm air is rising causing unstable atmosphere. Good luck to you too!

===message:I have been looking at the weather channel site, and other websites. I haven't found any good websites with maps. Can anyone let me know what map sites they are using? And what site is listed on moodle???

===message:I'm having some "heartburn" with the answers I am getting from ISU.  Last Friday was a spectacular day and I forecasted it to be just that.  I predicted the 18Z temp to be 74 from the NWS KMSP and ISU's answer was 62.  The actual temp was in the low 70's.  The sky was clear with minimal clouds and the wind out of the south at 20 kts.  Their answer was that the temp would be held down because of cloudiness.  Anybody else having problems?
