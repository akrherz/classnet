===more:Ahoy!  I'm curious what method everyone has for figuring out 
their forcasts.  Mine is pretty lame and un-refined as of yet.  On the course 
website there is a link to <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/forecast/
MapClick.php?
TempBox=1&ExtraBox=1&HumidBox=1&RainBox=1&PoPBox=1&Submit=Sub
mit&FcstType=graphical&textField1=44.9336051940918&textField2=-93.30
86166381836&site=mpx&DewBox=1&WindBox=1&SkyBox=1&ThunderBox=
1&AheadHour=0">an hourly weather site</a> with all sorts of lines and 
charts and graphs, so I open that and use the relevent info.  On this site, 
please note that if your mouse-over a time on the charts, it gives a text read-
out on the bottom, below the graphic charts.
<p>
But that lacks front information and the causes of percipitation questions 
(#13).  I am so far guessing on the last question, but for questions on fronts, 
I open up <a href="http://www.ral.ucar.edu/weather/progs/">the 00, 12, 
24, and 36 hour front forecasts</a> and use those to make a well 
educated guess.  Anyone else find any good, interesting ways to make 
forecasts?  I'm 
personally especially stumped on question 13, if you have good resources for 
that question.  Good luck with your forecasting!
