===message:I think we need some answers about the specific questions in the forecasting.  I am using the NWS Minneapolis for my info and have been doing pretty well.  My lowest grade is 29 and my highest is 40.  Question 13 has always been wrong.  It appears that "Unstable atmosphere" is a good bet, whatever that is.  Let's keep in touch.
