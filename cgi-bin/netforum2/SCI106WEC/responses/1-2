===message:I have been using the NWS Forecast Minneapolis at the bottom of the Moodle page for the course.  I have had pretty good luck with my forecasting using these figures.  Be careful.  The wind is in MPH and the answer for your forecast has to be in knots.  I got 40 on my last forecast submitted.  My problem is advection.
