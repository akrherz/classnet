My name is Lisa Procyk, pronounced as pro-sick.  I am married and have 2 wonderful teenage girls.  I attend off-campus classes part-time and work full-time.  At times it can be quite hectic trying to juggle day-to-day responsiblities.  I work at Pioneer and have been in research for 5 years.  Research deals with finding new novel genes for a variety of corn insect pests.  The reason for taking the class is to learn the classical distinctions between weeds and the herbicides used to control them.  It would be useful to know this especially with the type of background that I am currently in.  Can't wait to chat with you all.
Lisa
