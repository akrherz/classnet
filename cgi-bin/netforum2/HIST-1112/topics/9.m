===message:     I think what Nikita Khrushchev was talking about when he commented on “the truly free world of communism” was the fact that Soviet communism is based on the Marxists-Leninist idea of equality for the masses. The “so-called free world of capitalism” was referring to the idea that capitalism is just a way for the elitists to control the masses of  working people. If what I believe he was talking about, is truly what he was talking about, then his definition of free is lack of control or coercion of the masses by the elitists. 
     
<p>
The foundation of the Cold War was the differences in ideology between communism and capitalism. With both superpowers, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., trying to expand the ideology of there country and control the spread of the spread of the ideology of the other country this led to the foundation of the cold war. In the years of the cold war with both countries trying to expand and control the ideology of the other country they put pressure and fear on most of the world. In 1962 when the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. almost went to war over the Cuban missile crisis this revealed to the world the danger that could happen if the superpowers encountered each other in another war. With the threat of the apocalypse hanging in the balance should the superpowers decide to confront each other on the battlefield I believe this insured that no one in the world could truly be free because they could never feel safe as long as someone or some government has the ability to destroy all that they have and love. I don’t believe someone can truly be free if they are in fear of there life or the lives of there loved ones.

===message:To understand Khrushchev's definition of free, one must possibly understand a little about the man himself. Khrushchev was the son of poor illiterate peasants and began work himself at an early age. My research indicates that Khrushchev was not very well educated, either. He was pro Stalin and rose to power on Stalin's coattails. Khrushchev participated in purges and some of the atrocities of the Stalin era, yet denounced the Stalin atrocities (keeping his participation secret) after gaining control of the USSR. 
<p>
I think his definition of free was based more on the pure socialist definition of free....equality and opportunity for the working man, yet free from the greed and monopolism of capitalist society. Khrushchev was a common man placed in an extraordinary position at a most difficult period in history. From banging a shoe on table to squaring off with Nixon in the kitchen Khrushchev, in his own way, tried to correct some of the Stalin atrocities, preserve world peace, and protect the common man of all nations. In my opinion, Khrushchev was the most human of all the Soviet leaders since Stalin and probably the truest proponent of socialism.
 
<p>
The foundations of the Cold War were the competing idealogies of communism and capitalism. The world became divided by the two "superpowers" that emerged from WWII. The United States championing capitalism and democracy. The Soviet Union espousing communism. The devastation of WWI leaving nations weak and subject to the influence of the one or the other.
<p>
Tensions were so great during that time for the domination of each nation under one system or the other that neither system's citizens were truly free. McCarthyism and it's chilling effects to cookie cutter conformity coerced onto  the American people of having to live by a political standard as opposed to one of personal preference. Except for the postwar economic boon in America and Europe conditions would have been much worse with the resultant arms race.
<p>
The Cold War left the average Soviet citizen less free, also. A true socialism could not be achieved because the abuses of Stalin were not so easily remedied and the constant pressure on the citizens to compete with capitalists on every front. From trying to produce the finest weapons, athletes, and products the Soviets were bombarded with propaganda exhorting their systems as the best and still lived in fear and very little personal freedom, though somewhat better after the death of Stalin. The economic devastation wrought by the arms race in no small way contributed to less freedoms, also.

===message:The emergence of two superpowers at the conclusion of World War II with competing social and political ideals set the stage for the fifty year cold war.  As the Soviets clung to Communism and the United States held firmly to their philosophy of Capitalism each felt an equal desire and responsibility to preserve their way of life and prevent the spread of a form of government that was in direct conflict of their own.
<p>
Nikita Khrushchev believed freedom could be found through a social organization so harmonious that capitalism and the greed that accompanies it would become totally unappealing.  Through the elimination of private property and free enterprise, common good could be achieved for all citizens.  This humanistic approach would eliminate class warfare and promote unity through equality.  Through complete government control everyone does what they do best, and enjoys it, while meeting everyone’s basic needs equally in the process. 
<p>
One might wonder how the contrast between theory and practice could possibly be as extreme as it is in the application of Communism.  The USSR had to resort to violence to keep it’s citizen in the country.  They built walls and used brutal oppression to force their way of life onto their people.  It seems odd that this would be necessary in what should be a utopian society.  Communism provided few consumer goods and limited opportunities while capitalism saw prosperity and growth as well as a much higher standard of living.  
<p>
An argument could be made that during the cold war these superpowers prevented real freedom for the world’s people due to the constant underlying fear of nuclear war or even human annihilation.  However, if we are to assign blame it seems clear that the U.S. vision of a world where individual freedoms are possible was a viewpoint worth standing behind.  No one is trying to escape from the United States under threat of retribution.  The continuing movements toward freedom throughout the world are evidence that many aspire to enjoy the kind of life that we have.

The foundations of the cold war were the competing ideologies of capitalism and communism.  After WWII the United States and the Soviet Union were the two world super powers with each having different ideologies.  The United States wanted to stop the spread of communism, and the Soviet Union supported communism.  It was a war where neither side was willing to give, but there was never a clash of arms.

The rivalry between the two super powers affected every corner of the world.  Because many nations relied on economic and military aid from either of the superpowers, no one was truly free.  These nations had to align themselves with one of the superpowers to guarantee support, which would help aid in the development of their countries.

He believed in a communal society where everyone work together to achieve a common goal for the better of the entire people of his country. The capatalst society is built on a merit system that is unbalanced between the rich and the poor. The cold war started with the occupation of new land conquered and the mistrust between the Soviets and the United States after world war 2. The Soviets refused to leave the occupied territory of Germany. The two powers took up arms and gained new allies against each other. The Soviets and United States made the world paranoid because of the nuclear arms race and the encounters the two had in the past that could have resulted in a third world war. With this in mind people felt that anything could spark a war and during the cold war tensions between nations were high. When I was in the Army in the 80's the US Army always used the Soviets as the enemy when conducting training for the preparation of war.It often made us feel a little anxiety knowing there were tension in the air concerning us as people with family going to war for reasons we know nothing of.

	In Khrushchev’s speech to the communist party he explained that a free world was one in which people can come from abroad freely with open hearts.  A free world is open to honest trade, to scientific, technical, and cultural exchanges, to the exchange of truthful information.   Khrushchev argued that the world of capitalism is really where the “Iron Curtain” exists.  The capitalist world is free but its freedom is conditional.  One minute it is open to the Soviet people, the next minute it is closed.  They lets the Soviet cooks in one day, and forbade their entrance the next.  While the goal of the capitalist was to create a world where economic enterprise could thrive, the goal of the communist was to improve the lives of the working people and creating preferential trading arrangements in the region of soviet dominance.  Khrushchev was confident that people would choose the free world of communism over the so-called “free world” of capitalism.
	After World War II Europe was divided into competing political, military, and economic blocs.   U.S. allies consisting of parliamentary governments, and capitalist economies dominated Western Europe.  Eastern Europe was dominated by the Soviet Union, which consisted of communist governments.  The Cold War was an ideological contest between these two powers of capitalism and communism that avoided direct full-scale war.  It was a competition to see who would be the superpower to gain world control.  In the end, it came to shape foreign policy, economic systems, and political institutions of nations throughout the world.

He believed that capitalism was incapable of solving any urgent problems confronting mankind and communism was the solution. The cold war developed between the US and USSR after WWII. The confrontation was not only a great power rivalry; it was also a tense encounter between rival social and economic systems and competing ideologies. It was a clash between forces of capitalism and communism that gave rise to a new set of global relationships, shaping foreign policies, economic systems, and political institutions of nations throughout the world (1070). I believe it could be argued that in the cold war noone was truly free. People were expected to be on the capitalist side or the communist side and to support one of the two superpowers. For example, when western Germany decided to merge their occupation zones into a single economic unit and introduce new currency, the Soviets retaliated with a blockade andthe four power administration of Berlin was no longer in effect. People were not allowed to be truly free. It was either a communist world or capitalist world, not a free world.

They (men and women) would work, he would take what they earned, take his share, and then ration out equally what he wanted them to have.  The people wouldn't have to worry if they were going to get "paid" for their hard labors.  They knew that they would receive an equal ration.  Not what they deserved or earned, but what he rationed out.  Why would they want to take a risk on the capitalist's society by going out and having to take a chance on earning their own stability when they could have a little bit guarenteed to them?  What they didn't know did hurt them.

The Cold War was a power struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union.  Capitalism against communism, which would out-weigh the other.  They both sacrificed cooperation for their own country's interests.  They clashed over their political institutions and ideaologies, economic systems,  and foreign policies.

I do feel like both the Americans and Soviets insured that no one felt truly free.  How can one feel free when their government is at a nuclear war's edge?  How can one feel free when the two most powerful nations are threatening and intimidating each other?

<p>The foundations of the Cold War actually began before the end of World War II. The differences between the Soviet Union and the Western World really began when Russia was securing the front against Germany in Eastern Europe and asked for assistance from the Western allies. Instead of immediately aiding Russia, the Western allies went to war in Africa and then in France before coming to the aid of Russia. By this time Russia was building up more confidence and more power as a nation. This was also evident to the US as they used atomic bombs on Japan before Russia could enter the war in the Pacific. One of the main reasons the US resorted to atomic bombs was to intimidate Russia. At the end of the WWII, the Soviet Union and US became the world’s two economic and military superpowers. Both then made an effort to increase their sphere of influence throughout the world. When they butt heads with regards to the division of Germany into East and West Germany the Cold War came into full effect.</p>

<p>Arguing that in the Cold War the Americans and Soviets insured that no one was truly free would be a valid argument. This is evident by the speed at which each country raced to influence other countries to become allies. The mere fact that these two countries were both the military and economic superpowers of the world made other countries very dependent on them. Therefore countries obviously felt as if they had no choice but to align with one of the two superpowers. The superpowers also tried to divide the world in half by creating NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

The foundations of the Cold War began during the latter years of World War II. The United States and the Soviet Union had to come to a compromise despite their differenes to defeat their opponents; however once the war was over, so was the alliance between the two superpowers. the United States wanted the Soviet Union to redesign their government from communist to capitalist; while the Soviet Union felt the United States should redesign the government from capitalist to communist. The book explains how the cold war effected the world, "the first manifestations of the Cold war was the division of the European continent into competing political, military, and economic blocs- one dependent on the United States and the other subservient to the USSR - seperated by what Winston Churchill called the 'iron curtain'"(p.1070).
I do believe that during the Cold War no country- not individual- was "truly free". Either the government sided with the USSR or the United States. The book also explains why this "conflict of interest" was referred to as the cold war, "It was a contest in which neither side gave way, yet in the end the US and the Soviet Union always avoided  a direct clash of arms, hence the term cold war"(p.1070).

It was a heated rival between social, political, and economic systems (capitalism versus communism). The Cold War gave way to newly created global relationships, influencing foreign policies all over the world. It was a major realignment affecting the whole world that would last for decades.

What was Khrushchev's definition of free? I don't think he knew himself nor did we (US). I think both the Soviets and the US had equally interpreted definitions of what they thought "freedom" was based upon the stubbornness of each one's ideologies that has lasted for centuries. It is unfortunate that each one could have learned from each other to refine the thinking of both the US and the Soviets!    

In both countries stiff boundaries were created that stifled the freedoms and the security of many. For instance, the ensurance of freedom was blocked by the creation of the "Iron Curtain" whereby millions of people attempted to escape the ways of the east to the ways of the west. Unfortunately, for many lost their lives in the trek for freedom.

In the Kitchen Debate, Khrushchev saw the modern appliances and new kitchen gadgetry created for the stay at home woman (moms, housewives) to make their lives more comfortable and convenient as wastefulness of a capitalistic society.

On the other hand, the US capitalistic society had created a sense of freedom for some but opened the floodgates of bondage for others. It did not ensure that the needs of all (as did socialism) people were met. Many people were oppressed and struggling to just make it. Capitalism made way for racism, prejudice, inequalities, etc. While women complained about the unfairness of their roles in society, unequal employment (wage imbalances), gender conflicts, inequalities (they began to side with the ideals of Marxism), racism took it grip as well. Many black leaders such as ML King, and vocal figures as Bob Marley began to cry to voice of equality for their people. The society of capitalism was apparent to many that it was only for the elite!

Another added thing was the nuclear stand off between the US and the Soviets that kept the world in the bondages of fear. As nuclear arms were amounting, both sides recognized that a nuclear standoff was not the solution.

So in essence, yes, both the US and the Soviets insured that no one was truly free! 


P.S. Do you think that the new kitchen gadgets were a ploy to keep women attracted to the home? (Hmmm....)

Because of the sheer different ness of them they could not and would not contemplate coexistence. The fact that neither found the other acceptable also contributed. 
It can be most certainly argued that both the Americans and the Soviets insured that no one was truly free. Both nations felt that their way of governing was the correct way. Maybe for some people within those nations it was correct but it was not for everyone around the world. Unfortunately both tried to push their political, and consequently their social views on people other than the ones they governed directly. As a result they both came off as hypocrites around the world. 
	Through the governments actions the US showed they felt that democracy and capitalism was the correct way to govern and run a nation. They felt so strongly that they considered it necessary to push their views on other sovereign nations. During the Cold War they were known to over throw completely legitimate governments if they did not favor that government’s ideals. The same could be said about the Soviet Union.
