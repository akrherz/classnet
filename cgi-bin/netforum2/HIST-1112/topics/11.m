===message:US influence (domination) is like none other in history. We are the last remaining "superpower". The advanced superior military capability alone is an influential factor in world affairs. The permeation of US capitalism, technology, and culture in this increasingly interdependent world is unparalleled.
<p>
Are countries frightened by this rampant invasion of US culture characterized as Mcdonaldization? Absolutely. The cultural changes in this country frighten me. I certainly don't want to export the pseudo-food McDonald's anywhere. Convenience is not always the best choice in food or cultural lifestyle.
<p>
The Americanization of America itself should give any thinking person cause for concern. The various regional cultures of America characterized by such phrases as "Yankee ingenuity", "Midwest sensibilities", "Southern hospitality" are rapidly homogenizing into "Generation X"...the generation with no clear identity.
<p>
English is the universal business language. Almost anyone under the age of 50 in Europe speaks fluent English. Popular American music is sold and played around the world. American fast food has a presence in most of the world along with American fashion and other consumer goods. Mass communications such a television and the Internet give the world an instantaneous view of this culture.
<p>
That view in the last twenty years has included the Gulf War, an American President "who didn't inhale" and oral sexual acts are "not really sexual relations". His partner in "not really sexual relations" has parlayed that infamy into a pseudo television career. Does anyone remember the "Long Island Lolita"? She now writes a newspaper column and "Joey" has capitalized on his "fame", also. The OJ Simpson trial and the perversion of the American justice system. The ongoing racial intolerance and the widespread emergence of the black racists exacting payback by any means available on whites for injustices of previous generations. The recent rise and fall of the American stock market and the now revealed deceptions by accounting firms, corporate leaders, stock analysts and the bastion of misinformation (which should be investigated and prosecuted) CNBC.
<p>
What country would not want such entertainment fare such as "The Osbornes", "Anna Nicole", "Survivor", and the "WWF" piped into citizens homes on a daily basis? Just as recently as last week, a professional baseball player struck a mascot from behind with a baseball bat for absolutely no reason whatsoever.
<p>
Why would it frighten some countries to have these types of influences on it's culture and citizens? The real question here is why is it not disturbing more Americans that we even have a culture such as this?

===message:America is influencing other countries economically, politically, and socialy because of technology. Technology has helped bridge the gap between other nations and influence the way people see the world today. This feet is done through music television and computers. These are main access to other parts of the world. Many countries see America as a corrupt society that excepts bad as being good.For example women in America get to wear whatever they want and not feel ashamed where in other countries women are seen wearing more appropriate traditional clothing that do not expose their bodies and drive men to inappropriate desire for them.

===message:<p>First of all America is the most influential country in the world today because it is the only superpower in the world. The mere fact that it is the only superpower in the world gives America advantages and opportunities that no other countries have. This power allows America to have a major role in all global organizations and hence the power to control international laws and barriers such as trade. America’s economic and military power has allowed it to gain control of industries and resources in other countries because of its ability to provide technical assistance and military aid. Therefore the concept of Americanization and McDonaldization has been able to spread throughout the world. The US has been able spread hundreds of thousands of its corporations such as Burger King and McDonald’s, Coke and Pepsi, Barbie all over the world.</p>

<p>Countries are often wary and for good reason of the spread of Americanization and McDonaldization. For example in France, people were used to having traditionally lengthy lunches, but with introduction of American fast food restaurants, people are leaving the traditional bistros and cafes of France for fast food restaurants instead. This is leading to the close of many traditional restaurants in France and the disappearance of their traditional lengthy eating habits. This intrusion of traditional culture could also be found in Iran with the introduction of the Barbie doll. Barbie represented a "woman who never wanted to get pregnant and have babies" an this contradicted the traditional Iranian culture.</p>

===message:The terms "Americanization" and "McDonaldization" suggest that the consumer culture that developed in the US during the mid-twentieth century has been exported throughout the world (1144). The US is a major influence in the world today. Although controversial, Barbie had a big influence on people around the world. The US portrayed Barbie as a beautiful American woman and later modified her design to market her in Japan. Even Iranian children took an interest in Barbie, so Iran created the "Sara" doll to compete with Barbie while promoting Islamic values. Other than toys, American food and beverages took on a global influence. Pepsi, Coke, Burger King, McDonalds, and Pizza Hut can be found throughout the world. French cafes closed down due to the preference of "fashionable fast food." The success in the spread of US culture seems to threaten cultures everywhere. Instead of continuing traditional cultural practices, people are taking advantage of the fun, modern day advantages the US culture has to offer. This creates a tension from the US intervening in foreign countries and taking away what they once held so dear. I believe some countries are frightened by this influence because their people have become more concerned with wants and desires rather than needs and necessities. They want more than they need and often times their wants can become symbolic. This act of differentiation is a major threat to other countries who consider their traditional cultures and values the only way of life. They are afraid of change and don't want another country to come in and alter their lifestyle; even if it is beneficial.

===message:Examine concepts such as Americanization and McDonaldization. How influential is the United States in the world today? Why are some countries frightened by this influence? 
Americanization and McDonaldization.  To me means the spread of not only our views but also the sell of our views to the world.  We have been very influntial in the changing of culture as many regions of the world knew it to be.  We are a strong influence on the world as a whole.  By way of television we allow the world to see the worst that we have to offer with very little of the good.  Because contrary to belief A lot of the world only broadcast the things that view us as savages and greed.  Now we must take into consideration that everyone does not have 1000 channels to surf the net and certian leisures that we have but when they do its not all good.

The United States is very influntial in the world today.  We spread our views and ideas to many countries.  We have been a major force in youthful trends in several countries.  Now wether that is good or bad I cant say.  I know that when I was in the military in Germany During the Reagon ERA.  I was very proud to be an American but I was also very proud of the heritage that was seen in Germany.  As my tour ended I realized how Americanized the youth had become.  Many of the adults remained the same.  I don't know wether it was rebellion as all kids do or exactly what it was.  But it was so out of place to see a Frenchman wearing hammer pants or walking around with a Michael Jackson outfit.  It just did not fit.

Many countries are frightened by our influence because it is taken away from thier culture.  Many Americans a long time ago had pride in passing on the farm to Johnny and I think in other countries the same values exist.  The American influence has demoralized many of the traditions that have allowed a nation to keep its history and influence on thier children.  I mean if you go online you will find chat rooms from everywhere.  Now that has it good and bad.  I dont really know where this world is headed but one thing I do believe in is culture and heritage and really believing in something and unfortunately we truly dont believe in anything in the US.  And this is spreading worldwide through the children of the world.  

I have really enjoyed this class and I hope no one was offended by any statements in this discussion or any other reply.  I hope everyone does well and stay safe.  OUT!!!!!!!!

===message:<p>The two concepts of “Americanization” and “McDonaldization” are two terms which basically describe the changing of societies today, which are accepting and progressing towards an Americanized culture.  Our American culture can basically be summed up into the phrase, “Consumer Nation”.  This is basically the desire for Americans to want more stuff, material items, and the newer and better model.  We work to pay off our credit debts, while we purchase new cars and houses.  While we have credit debt to pay, our continuous desires for more things further pushes our society to a greater materialized possessing nation.  Despite that some nations reject this culture, the United States continues to influence and alter other cultures as the years pass.</p>
   <p>The United States has many different ways it influences its culture and interests other nations today.  In one regard we are the most wealthy and fortunate nation in the world, and have much to offer in investments and other economic gains to other nations.  One example of our economic power is the Marshall Plan, which provided more than $13 billion to the reconstruction of Western Europe after WWII.  This not only rebuilt nations and their economy, but also helped progress them towards making consumer based markets.  One of the countries that have prospered the most is Japan.  The U.S. gave this country from $2 billion alone, and by the 1980’s was almost surpassing the United States with the largest economy.  Now Japan is one of the world’s leading marketers in electronics, cars, and technology.</p>
   <p>Another way that the United States is able to influence the world today is through its military.  Since we are the last remaining superpower, having various Armed Forces divisions, that is a sure advantage to match and surpass any other threat to our nation.  Without the aid of presence of a military, there would have been little that America could have done through the cold war in suppressing communism.  Just recently with the attacks on Iraq, the U.S. could not have put a stop to the terrorism and evils over in that land, without the presence of military action.  This isn’t to say that U.S. intervention in every national matter is necessary, and I believe it is not.  Although, whenever we need to defend our rights, or assist another nation in need, we are a nation that is more than able to do that.</p>
   <p>The last point I’d like to make on our influence is the use of technology.  With the internet, airline systems, and television, it is no wonder that the world knows so much about our culture and what we are.  The ability to advertise and bring our presence to other nations in itself is a major factor.  The fact that the English language is dominating the internet and communications, gives Americans a greater push in influence.  The best way to influence people is by having your presence in your neighbor’s backyard.  With the internet and our food, clothing, and entertainment markets being advertised in other countries, it is only a matter of time before the peoples will either totally reject or accept it.</p>
   <p>The reason that some countries might be frightened and reject our American concepts is because it goes against their cultural beliefs and is also possibly inappropriate in that society.  The scenario with the Barbie doll is a great example to talk about.  Iran saw the perception and personality of the doll, totally against the values and beliefs of their Islamic culture.  The women of this culture are not as freely allowed to express themselves as American women, and thus why the Barbie concept was rejected and changed.  Japan saw the doll as inappropriate and changed the appearance of it.  Since I have been to Japan, and experienced this culture, I can totally understand the way they changed the appearance of their Barbie doll.  In the Japanese culture, the people are more modest.  Only young people wear shorts.  In Japan people are quieter in public than here in America and avoid eye contact.  So the description of the doll in our history book well fits how I have perceived the Japanese culture.  Anyway, the basic reason why countries are afraid of “Americanization” is that it conforms their culture and combines it with ours, which in some areas of the world is greatly unwanted.</p>

===message:I think the spread of Americanization and McDonaldization is both good and bad. I don’t really hold with the idea that one country should force its itself on another country or try to manipulate its ideas on another country by advertising and propaganda. I can understand that we do this for greed, now most people feel this is a bad thing but I personally don’t think it is. I think greed is just another tool that is used to make our lives better and safer. Corporations are out to make money, the money they make is then paid to company personnel, owners and stockholders. This money is used to enhance peoples lives and safety. The corporation doesn’t care if you are male, female, black, white, brown, yellow or blue, they will sell you a Big Mac as long as you have the money. I think that is the problem with some of these other countries, they want to keep segregation and discrimination alive and well and thriving were they live. As global corporation and free trade spread around the world the pay for labor in undeveloped counties will increase as personnel in those counties learn what personnel in other country’s make and unions spread to the undeveloped world. From my point of view this is a good thing and the American way.

I was watching an episode of Star Trek the Next Generation when it hit me that we as a nation should heed the Prime Directive of the Federation of Starships, that being “the passive observance of new worlds and cultures without interrupting their normal evolution.”  Can you imagine going to the planet Neptune and telling them, “I know you’ve been existing for 1000’s of years without our input, but we have this concept call McDonald’s that we think would be great for your economy.”  Now, I realize this is an oversimplification, but sometimes such an extreme view can bring us back to reality.
<p>
The US goes into countries with the attitude of an Alien landing on earth, spewing out the statement “We come in peace,” with hands stretched out humbly.  This quickly changes to, “We come in the name of humanitarian aid,” as, symbolically, we give meat to vegetarians (something that they don’t necessarily need or want).  Which later changes to, “We come in the name of progress,” as we interject fast foods restaurants into a culture that doesn’t know what “processed, pasteurized, imitation cheese” is, or it’s adverse affects on a culture that’s totally virgin to “junk food”.
<p>
Yes, Captain Picard and the Federation are correct in their enforcement of the Prime Directive.  For how the influence of a culture, that may be somewhat superior in culture and technology, affects the natural evolution of a society cannot be controlled or predicted.  Yes that small country in “Live-Long Province”, where all the inhabitants live to the age of 150, should be frightened by the 80-year US humanitarian coming “in the name of progress” to help them live longer; rrrright!

===message:Americanization and McDonaldization has in every aspect dominated the world. It is not uncommon to find a McDonald's in some of the most remote places on the map! As cultures clashed and intermingled even on friendly terms, they had opoprtunity to exchange ideas, technology, cultural practices, lifestyles, and set up corporations, whereby each other had the opportunity to experience diverse goods, services, etc. For instance, after the Berlin Wall fell, East Germans experienced drinking Coca-Cola served to them by West Berlin store owners. The Burger Kings, McDonalds and Pizza Huts were globalizing rapidly. Likewise, in the US, Armani, Gucci, Rolex became US household brands. People began to comsume and try new things. Television and global communication systems and networks helped to expose people to see "new" places, faces, and things. 

But on the other hand, there was still a resistance experienced amongst some. For the likes of the Barbie Doll...well, she was not well liked in Iran. Barbie was the embodiedment of American cultural influences stating that Barbie was the "Trojan Horse". She exemplified the western cultural influences with "indecent clothes" and "make-up" and staying young (which was not welcomed in Islamic cultures because they did not hold to feministic views). They were afraid that those influences would eventually be passed on to the children.

I think that there are other reasons why people are not open to change:

1 - some governments do not allow for the freedom of expresion and fear that might shake the foundations of their cultural and traditional beliefs.
2 - people might just have the opportunity to think for themselves!
3 - some societies are comfortable living "their" way
4 - they see the US as an intimidator and aggressor whereby we might take advantage of an opportunity to ease in, taking over their lands, societies, influence their governments, and creating "little western images". Little Mini-Me's.

The urban areas of Itlay want to take advantage of US tourist vacationing in their ancient treasures. Most hotels, restaurants, train stations,and other places visited by tourist will most certainly have english speaking personnel to adcomandate Americans who are ignorant of the native language. McDonald's represents America's culinary skills for most of the world. Once you see some of the other countries first hand you realize that there are a lot of cultures and difference, but we are all so much the same in some many ways. We all say the same thing just in different ways of speech. America is very influecial, but so much of America is influenced by the widest external influece there is.

Most likely if we give aid or protection, we want something in return. That doesn't mean that they want to be forced or obligated to choose one country over another in a time of global conflict.

===message:Many countries/nations have had either direct interaction with Americans through media, music, and fashion or a little more indirectly through economics and politics. Invariably they will to some extent be affected by this interaction. The American way of live and its people’s ideals are bound to effect if not change some people. 
	English today is spoken all over the world. It didn’t start with the United States because they were not the first people to speak English. Rather it started with the British and their colonies and was pushed further when the US started making economic contracts with other countries. US businesses would move in and with them would come American businessmen. Some times with these businessmen would come their families. Another example would be the various military bases positioned around the world. A good portion of the people overseas at these bases don’t speak the language of the natives, instead they speak English. Around, or on these bases are English catering businesses. So it’s like they never even left the states. The native people might decide that in order to get the business that’s desired from those Americans they will need to learn the language. The extent the English language is used outside of the traditionally English speaking countries means a lot. The US didn’t do it all but it did, in this last century contribute considerably to the spread of the language to other countries/nations. 
	The amount of crap someone can get away with shows the amount of influence they have on those surrounding them. Concerning US foreign policy it seems that they are extremely influential. During Carters presidency he was able to overthrow legitimate governments without the surrounding nations moving against the US. That had to do with the power of the US. Also during the Cold War when the US government purposely instigated, or more so flamed the fires of discontent in certain Latin American countries there was not so much as a squeak from the national community. Well to be fair there was a squeak but nothing loud enough to distract the US government from its agenda. Now in the present day the US uses foreign policy in Middle Eastern countries that they would consider worth steeping in to prevent if it were anyone else. This time there has been quite a squeak in the national community but still the US has not been, in reality, challenged. Those are all examples of the amount of influence the US has around the world. 
	Of course when one person has such influence other people without it or affected by it in a negative way are going to be weary at the least. Influence at this magnitude also allows for change. US influence is strong in some countries, and this influence is strong enough to slowly erode the traditions of a society. Some times it can be for the better and other times it isn’t. It all depends on the society and the people who are being influenced. Some want to take the good of a situation but leave the bad off to the side. With the US it is hard to do that because its influence is like dust. It just seeps in everywhere. The books that people can buy, the clothes or styles they may have, the music that they listen to the food they eat and, I feel, most importantly the ideas and ideals of that nations that is influencing. Some people are ready and willing for the change that the influence of an outside source will bring and some people aren’t. Those who aren’t are frightened by the influence this outside source may have on its peoples.

The United States has the best military forces in the world.  They are smart and most of all they take pride in being an American.  When the United States decided to seek Osama Binladen for the 9-11 attacks, the UN was opposed to their decision, as well as other countries that said that they either will not support them or go against them,but, instead, when the President of the United States along with military intelligence and all of the soldiers, ( you get the point) charged to defend our country for what had happened, no one stepped in to counter attak or defend our aggressors.

As far as influence,  what is done in the United States is always more comercialized than other countries that are set in their religions and their way of life and do not want this liberal influence to turn their people against their form of government.

===message:The United States has been a very influential nation for centuries and still consists to be a world wide influence.  Americanization and McDonaldization are prime examples of this.  Almost everywhere you go you can see some form of American influence instilled in that society.  Whether it is in the way they dress, the music they listen to, or the food they eat American influence cannot be denied.  It is therefore no surprise that certain societies fear this influence.  The prime reason being that they believe this influence will destroy indigenous cultures in the country.

===subject:Do you think it is good or bad to be an influential country?
===message:I believe it is good to have influence and power. It is not bad to have the two only the way it is distributed. If a country abuses the influence or use it wrongly than it can be a problem. I think that it is wonderful to have a country that is powerful and very respected. So to answer the question I think it is good to have to influence.
