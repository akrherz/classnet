===more:Anthropologist William Weatherford entitles his book on
the Columbian Exchange "Indian Givers." When you think
about it, the so-called "New World" has given the "Old
World" a great deal. Who do you think benefited most
from the Columbian exchange? Europeans, Asians,
Africans, or Americans? Which was the most important
"gift" from the Americas? Which was the most important
"gift" given to Native Americans? Defend your answer.
