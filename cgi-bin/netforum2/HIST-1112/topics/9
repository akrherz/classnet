===more:Nikita Khrushchev predicted that eventually people “will give their preference to the truly free world of communism and turn their back on the so-called `free world' of capitalism.”  What was his definition of free?  What were the foundations of the Cold War?  Could it be argued that in the Cold War the Americans and Soviets insured that no one was truly free?
