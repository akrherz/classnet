===message:Paintings no longer depicted recognizable objects from the everyday world and beauty was expressed in pure color or shape (1008). Some artists used distortion of forms or tried to communicate an inner dream or vision. The paintings of Marcel Duchamp and Pablo Picasso made a statement about the beauty of nudity in art form, Dechamps being more abstract. These paintings, although controversial, reflected the freedom of expression. The painting by Paul Gauguin shows the beauty of things as they used to be with vivid colors and strong outlines. As far as the photographs, they reflect the introduction of photography. The one of the mother with her children reflects the sadness and worry caused from the great depression. The one of Hitler reflects the hatred and evil that many people experienced. There were many sources of anxiety during this age. Employment, freedom, the economy, and just plain survival to name a few. Fascism was to regenerate the social, political, and cultural life of societies that had been ruined. Communism was used by strong leaders to come in to weaker countries and transform them. Nationalism thrived due to the dream of intellectuals and goals of political leaders to gain independence from foreign powers and attain national unity.

===message:<p>The Age of Anxiety brought a change of mind and ideals to many individuals of this era.  Most notably was the change from contemporary painting to the freedom of expression with art.  No longer did structure precede a masterpiece, but how the artist perceived appearance and reality.  A painting also could be a distorted image without recognition and still be seen as beautiful.  This new change in art was a pointer to the changing imaginations and ideals for the generations during the Age of Anxiety.  The photos also express the depression and prejudice during these years.  The face of the woman (1014) clearly expresses her suffering and helplessness during this age.  With the two young children behind her, we can only speculate at the thoughts running through her mind, on how she’d be able to give them a life worth living.  The photo on page 1026 shows exactly the anti-Semitism that the Nazi’s had against the Jews.  This era was a time of change and conformity to the status of the economy and the unfair regulations against minorities in nations such as Germany.</p>
<p>There are many different elements that contribute to the anxiety of the world after the Great War.  The great depression and poor economic state of the entire globe was a hole in the road for almost everyone.  The inability to provide the basic essentials for the family would be enough to drive people to depression or suicide.  The racism in Germany and throughout Europe also had to lead to anxiety for many Jews.  Taking away Jewish privileges such as banking and business led the Jews to have no place in society.  This Anti-Semitism was a major problem for any Jewish person living within German lands.</p>
<p>The struggle of governments to enhance society also led to stress within the nations.  With the widespread economic dismay and ineffective governments to bring prosperity, communism, fascism and nationalism all seemed to be successful during this strenuous time.  When national figures such as Lenin and Mussolini came into position, the people supported the new ideas of relief against poverty and war.  Since the people had desperate needs for survival and change, they were willing to put their trust and give power over to the ones who seemed able to bring them out of their struggles.</p>

===message:I think there are several underlying reasons why the paintings styles changed in the years between and after the world wars. The most common reason for the change is the  technology of the camera. It takes more time to paint a picture and you don’t always get the details with a painting that you get with a picture. The underlying reason are human suffrage, both physical and mental. In the years during and after the world wars the anxiety and hopelessness of society was so great that most people could not cope with it. Some of our greatest artists painted and wrote their best works during this time of  world suffrage. It was a time when the horrors of war and the consequences were brought home to the people. Before this time most people did not understand the horrors that were associated with war because the majority of the population stayed at home and army’s fought organized wars that while bloody, had relatively few casualties. With the coming of world war, mass casualties, both civilian and military, economical drain, the hopelessness and despair of the depression, these were all reflected in what artists wrote and painted. 
<p>
<br>
The reason fascism, communism and nationalism all thrived during this time was because of hopelessness. Most European counties had the idea that they were invincible and that any war they were involved in would be a conquest of weeks. With the disillusionment of the great war and the collapse of European economy’s the population was susceptible to any and all ideas that would bring about prosperity and security. This is the reason I believe that so many different forms of government thrived at this time.

===message:All of the ideas I see represented in these discussion responses seem to be very insightful and right on the mark.  I agree that art and photographs were changing as a reaction to new feelings being dealt with throughout the world.  Works were often the subject of much controversy but were also embraced as people became more enlightened and open to new means of expression.  What we see in the art and photographs of that time are often directly related to the elements associated with the Age of Anxiety.  The disillusionment and uncertainty that grew from the war and the depression, the challenging of accepted truths related to science and religion, and the fear and pessimism felt at an unknown future by  the “lost generation” are represented in the artistics works of the time.  As revolutions in physics and psychology took place artists sought ways to capture the ideas that photographs could not.
<p>
Various extreme political philosophies became very popular during this time due to peoples' desparation for a government that would provide for basic needs as well as hope for the future.  In an era of such economic catastrophe, democracy appeared inefficient and charismatic leaders offering hope of a better life were very attractive.

The different styles of artistic ability were being accepted with a more open view.  The photography that is on 1014 & 1026 represent the reality of the times.  Real people are caught in real life situations.  There is no denying the stress and anxiety that these two very different people felt while their pictures were being taken.  Nationalism during this time had backfired due to the Great Depression.  Communism although very controversial survived for a while, as a strong social and political system.  Fascism thrived due to the many dedicated followers.  The rural and middle class found the fascist movement very appealing.

===message:One factor that affected art and the perception of art was the invention of the camera. Why would art now have to be a reproduction of reality when the camera was available to do so? The new schools of thought held that the art object could now be the art as opposed to the subject reproduced by the art. This allowed artists greater freedom of expression with their works. An artist could now attempt to express a thought, an emotion, or a vision with art. The art depicted in the textbook is representaive of the new school of thought. The photography in the textbook tends to reflect the thoughts and emotions of the subject matter of the photograph...not just trying to accurately reproduce what is only seen. After WWI people questioned the systems of government, societies, and ideals that could have wrought such devastion on the planet. The art and photogaraphy of the period seemed to reflect peoples changing attitudes.
<p>
<br>
After surviving the greatest conflict, up to that point, in world history people would naturally be anxious about the factors that pecipitated the war. Were the present societies, governments, and ideals that were in place prior to WWI the systems that humanity would want to perpetrate if such devastation could ensue from them? Couple that with the global depression, economic contraction, and dissatisfaction with policies of present forms of government then the alternatives of facism and communism would certainly be given more consideration by peoples of the world than if recent years had been peaceful and prosperous.

===message:<p>The key word to note when comparing the paintings and photos is primitive. From the paintings displayed on pages 1002, 1008 and 1009 we can see that the age of anxiety was a period in which society separated from its old forms and traditions. There was a general disappearance of standards, which could be seen in the artists by the disappearance of “accepted standards that distinguished between “good” and “bad” art.” This changed in artistry also seemed to mimic the change in society around these times. The pictures on pages 1014 and 1026 demonstrated the changing society in which people families suffered because of economic depression, and Jews were segregated from the rest of the German society. Both the paintings and pictures reflect a period in which the world returned to its primitive economies, and primitive exploitation of minority races through fascism, communism and nationalism.</p>

<p>The main sources of anxiety during this period were the Great Depression and the sentiment of nations. The Great Depression was the cause of much suffering and devastation. The deflated economies throughout the world resulted in “acute physical and social problems” (1014). Marriage declined and suicide rates increased during this period and economic inequality resulted in class hatred. The sentiment of nations was also a cause of anxiety. This led to the rise of Anti-Semitism in Germany and the devastation of the Jewish people.</p>

<p>The reason why fascisms, communism, and nationalism thrived during these times is because people were struggling, disillusioned, and in need for people to lead them out of this depression. Stalin, Mussolini, and Hitler rose to power because they provided direction for people who were very much in need of it. Stalin provided the people with the First Five-Year Plan. Mussolini inspired people who had been disappointed by over their territorial spoils from the peace settlement. Hitler convinced the German people that the Jews had been responsible for the depression. These three men inspired nations that were in need of some form on stimulation and hence the fascism, communism and nationalism they introduced to the people were able to thrive.</p>

===message:The Age of Anxiety was a time of social change.  The art during this period was an expression of individualism.  In my opinion, artists and photographers turned inward and used their pieces of work to express what was in the subconscious or the inner-spirit.  Although the paintings and photographs were different forms of art, they both captured what the artist or photographer saw.
<p>
<br>
After World War I, the world was left in a state of disdain and despair.  People were confused, and I think the pieces of art in question are symbolic of those feelings.   The paintings could be an expression of what the artist saw or felt or what the artist wanted to see or feel (fictional or fact).  The photography represented what the photographer actually saw.  On one hand, I view the painting on page 1009, as the naked truth.  The many faces, bodies, and colors to me represent different cultures of life stripped of baggage (naked), carefree, and open to new beginnings and ideas.  However, on the other hand one can suggest that the stripped bodies represent cultures without differences other than physical features but equal on all perspectives more unified.    My question is whether or not the artist was trying to show today’s society as he sees it (the carefree new beginning) or tomorrow’s view, as he would like to see it, a united world without confusion.  As we know, the world was not united after World War I.
<p>
<br>
During this turbulent age, the sources of anxiety were the Great Depression and the insecurities of war.  The Great Depression gave way to defeat, and people all over the world felt helpless.  Because people felt defeated and helpless, fascism, communism, and nationalism thrived because people were eager to listen to anything that promised change from their current condition.  For example, Hitler’s political party thrived and rose to power because Germany faced a 40% unemployment rate, and he promised to restore economic strength to Germany.

===message:After viewing the photographs, I felt the first big change in the reflection of the "age of anxiety" was that artists went from painted artwork to actual photographs.  I would imagine the artists used the paintings to reflect their inner feelings and emotions, whether they were confused, angry, happy, etc.  There were also artists who were influenced by Freud, trying to tap into the subconcious mind, to communicate an inner vision or a dream (1008).  Many used explosive colors, distorted figures, asymmetrical compositions, and many other forms in their work.  I believe that they were trying to express their own feelings.  It seems, as with the photographs, that the artists were trying to symbolize what was going on in the world on the faces of other people.  Seeing the faces of the existent makes it seem more believable; the devastation and suffering of the Great Depression.  The picture on page 1026 shows to what great lengths the Nazi's went to decipher the "real" Germans from those who weren't.  The photographs are just so factual.  It makes it reality.
<p>
There were a couple of sources that lead to the "age of anxiety."  The Great Depression was a major factor.  There was the Great War and all of its destruction.  The stock market crash lead to great economic difficulties.  Globally, event after event lead to anxiety, frustration, confusion, uncertainty, and death.
<p>
I believe facism, communism, and nationalism all thrived during this time because people were looking for something -a better way of life, a different road, a way out of poverty, or a means of "getting somewhere."  Others didn't have a choice, their direction in life was made for them by the dictator they fell under.

===message:      The time between the wars was a very uncertain time.  During this uncertain time, many people found themselves with time on their hands and sought ways of spending it.  Because the world was in such chaos at the time, many painters chose to take that chaos a little further in their depictions. The painting on page 1002 exhibited a lot of mental anxiety. It seems that the artist was trying to say that once upon a time people had everything and were sitting on top of the world.  Now they have been stripped of it all and are forced to go back to the bottom. Even going to the bottom doesn't prove to be that easy looking at the condition the stairs are in.  Picasso’s painting on page 1009 was a deliberate attempt at distorting reality.  Maybe he was dealing with some inner feeling about the way he saw women. They have distorted figures and distorted faces.  Maybe he felt that since women were participating in the war taking on roles that were once for men only, they were now exposed, with very little femininity and sex appeal.
	The artist on page 1008 chose to depict things a little differently.  He used bold beautiful colors and created his masterpiece on a more positive subject.  Maybe he was looking forward to a better life in Tahiti.
	The pictures on page 1014 and 1026 took a more realistic approach to the current economic situation.  The use of a camera offered the photographer very little room for exaggerations.  The pictures bring to reality the harsh truths of the economy and the treatment of humans during this anxious time.

I think this picture best depicts the way people felt when they were living through the Great Depression. The other pictures seemed to depict other happenings in the world, for instance the picture on page 1026 where a Nazi uses a caliper on an elderly man to decipher his race. In 2003, we would think that that kind of behavior would be unacceptable, however it was a part of life for those living during this "Age of Anxiety". Basically, the title of the chapter says it all, during that age no one knew what to expect next. Jews had to endure Hitler's cynical acts to "purify" the world by trying to, and almost accomplishing, wipe out their entire race. Most of the rest of the world were enduring the effects of the Great Depression which put many out of work and led to harsh living arrangements. Lastly, I believe the only reason the ideals and ideologies of facism, communism, and nationalism were able to strive was because people felt let down or as if they had no self-worth. We know better now but thankfully we will never see such a state again.

As the societies changed and issues of nationalism, economic stresses of post war trauma, political changes, and other global happenings, artist began to express themselves and express life through various forms of media such as paintings, photography, displaying the changing faces of cultures and societies. 

In comparison (as to the spirit of nationalism and self determination) artist began to express "freedom and change" in various forms of nude art (Picasso's and Duchamp's nude works) and distorted figures, unlike the previous definable objects of times past. Increasingly controversial abstract and distorted works were appearing. In this art, you can sense the spirit of "liberation" and "self will". 

Also appeared the real life struggles, expressions of despair, horror-fied, and hopeless expressions and harsh realities of people in their day-to-day environment in paintings as well as photography (like the "Migrant Mother" and the Nazi "racial expert"). Art brought the reality home. It show cruelty and suffering in a changing society.

The sources of anxiety during this turbulent age were from many directions. One I would call the "post war blues". Many people grew pessimistic after the war with much uncertainty and despair. Secondly, I also believe that all the media that was available that was used as a means of expression at the time such as the art, photography, writings, religious opinions of the religious speakers (many were speaking doom) might have added to the anxiety. People now had visual pictures to relate to as well as other opinions to validate their feelings of anxiety. Much of the works after the war reflected on the casualties of war and a doomed society. Thirdly, drastic financial problems struck the land (stock market crash, 1929), and economic woes (employment, wages, layoffs). Lastly, the Great Depression added greatly to the anxieties of the time.

Fascism, communism, and nationalism all seemed to thrive because as people loss hope waiting for the help of other countries and their governments to aid in fulfilling their dreams of a successful future, economic stability, and security, many people sought the opportunity to try new ideas and leadership to hopefully create the kind of society that had been hoping for. The times of economic instability proved ripe soil for these types of movements to spring up and take control. People were eager to try it since their current forms of government had appeared to be unsuccessful. 

Fascism was a "new" ideal that sought to create a "new" kind of society. It gained popularity during economic and social crises. They were also attractive to nationalist of all classes. This also helps in strengthening the numbers of the populous.

Communism seemed to thrive because after the Great War, nationalist interest was at heights and grew rapidly in areas such as China due to shattered dreams by Europe and the US for reform of China. Their dreams were shattered by the increased Japanese interference in China (which made way for the "new" Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai).

Nationalism as well as Communism and Fascism (for that matter) grew out of turbulent political times. For example, Indian nationalism as well as Chinese nationalism all grew out of a desire to release themselves from the grips of imperialism.

The photo on page 1014 is just a literal representation of the result of the Great depression.  The Great Depression caused serious levels of unemployment and impoverishment.  The photo on page 1026 represents the racial persecution of the time led by Adolf Hitler.  The basic concept of the Nazi racist ideology is reflected in this picture.  These paintings and photos represent the changing world of the Age of Anxiety.  The source of anxiety during this time period resulted mainly from the effects of the Great Depression.

===message:        The art during the “Age of Anxiety” often showed, or at least attempted to show the emotions that people felt at that time. A good deal of people went into the war with high hopes and unrealistic expectations. The sharp slap of reality was expressed by some in the art that followed the war. I personally feel a painter such as Pablo Picasso expressed very well the “Age of Anxiety.”
	The art before the war had a decidedly different feel to it. Henri Matisse’s “Open Window” can be an example. When looking at the painting you just <or I do> feel a sense of peace and general calm, in contrast when looking at Marcel Duchamp’s “Nude Descending a Staircase” you wouldn’t get any of that general calm. It feels more like looking at a hectic whirlwind in progress. And because of the after effects of the war you couldn’t be faulted for assuming that’s how people felt as well; as if they were looking at a hectic whirlwind in progress.  
	The economic collapse throughout most of the world was enough to invoke a feeling of anxiety. Take for instance the effects in the United States; during the economic depression there was also a drought in the heart of the farm lands. This drought, and other factors such as bad soil usage, eventually leads to the ‘dust bowl’ which then eventually leads to the loss of jobs, homes and lands by farmers. 
The lack of economic stability pushed people to look for something that could fix their world. The different emerging political views provided for some that particular “something”. Take communism, some saw it as the perfect way to eliminate the whole concept of have and have not. If everyone is working, in essence, for the good of each other then in theory there should be no way for a person to go without. The ideas of nationalism and fascism each represented also gave people something new to latch onto.

The picture of Dorothea Lange, "Migrant Mother", shows a woman with her children clinging to her looking for protection and comfort as she wonders what will be next, how is she going to survive the after war and provide for her children.  You can see the pain, the exhaustion, and the suffering, the poor quality of life that she has experienced.  On the other picture, dispite the poverty, the two children seme to enjoy the limited space and probably water they have to share to bathe.  Either through art or pictures, people found a way to express their feelings, and in a sence, their hope for a better future.  
According to the lecture, postwar pessimism described a vast majority of this time.  Phycis and phychology revolutionized with Alber Einstein's theory of relativity, which I believe is still true today, space and time are relative to the person mesuring them, or the observer.  Others expresed their anxiety through experimentation in art and architecture, for example, the Bauhaus , which initiated an international style showing function combined with simple shapes, steel frames, and walls of glass.
In the other hand, the unstable global economy, the inability to provide food, employment, among other things necessary for the survival of the human race created a real sence of disiluciomend and suicide amongs the population.
Given that the Allied Powers, who were the ones that favored democracy, sovereingty, etc., were not producing any real inmediate progress with regards to the real situation which, for example, the British did not want to see or deal with the reality after the WW1, fascism, communism and nationalism seem to provide and reach the gap of the uncertain times that the world was living at the time.

Uncertainty abounded throughout this period and was made increasingly uncertain because entire governmental systems were being challenged.  Many knew that the obsolite systems would not catapult their society into thriving industry as well as established stabilized bounces of power.  In Europe, especially, citizens were almost bullied into expecting new and orderly reformes only to become victims to this fresh approach.  The picture on page 1002 depicts a person desending a staircase.  This person does't seem to be walking confidently, but almost stumbling and trying to regain balance.  The movement in the piece seems haunting and painful.  I'm sure many of the German and Italian people felt as though they were stumbling through a confused maze of oppossition and brute strength, unable to recover any semblance of their formal selves.  The woman in the picture on page 1014 looks like she is trying to map out a good existence for herself and her children, but is unable to even provide the basic necessities.  She's worn and weathered.  Her eyes are strained.  She physically can not "see" her way to a brighter future.  She makes her children shield their faces from such a bleek future.  Fascism, communism, and nationalism all thrived at this time because nations wanted to try different systems.
