===message:<p>I believe that most people’s lives are better today than those over a hundred years ago.  With the advancements of technologies and medicines, people can live easier and healthier lives.  Over the past hundred years many cures and vaccines have been created for various diseases.  Transportation to and from work through automobiles and bus systems also make it easier for people to reach distances for work.  These are only a few examples of how lives have been improved over the past century.  There are many different things that add up to the improvement of American life.</p>
<p>The industrialization has played a major role in transforming our world into what it is today.  In industrial nations, almost anyone is able to purchase clothing to wear, food to eat, or furniture for the house.  The ability for mass production of materials is what greatly allowed this to happen.  The easier and faster an item is produced the cheaper it can be sold.  When a country is not in a recession or poor economical situation, it is fairly easy for any person to find a job.  The opportunities for a moderate life are available for most people of society.</p>
<p>One way industrialization has negatively impacted people, is our dependence on certain types of industries.  These companies I speak of are the insurance and pharmaceutical industries.  It is almost impossible for a family to make payments for medical bills without having a good medical plan.  These are some of things a worker receives while employed by companies.  If a person is going through a time without a job, it can be very stressful for the entire family during times of financial need.  In some ways, all people of the United States are dependent on these insurance and medical industries that usually charge high amounts of money for the services required in our society.</p>
<p>I do not believe that a nation has to be industrialized to be great.  What is the definition of a great nation?  Is it one that makes the most money and has the most vehicles in the drive way?  I believe that the people of a nation have to decide for themselves what is great, and what keeps them happy.  From the perspective of families, I would imagine that some unindustrialized nations have closer family ties then most industry driven nations.  This is just one example of what a unindistrialized nation could have, which an industry driven one might not.</p>  
<p>I would have to say that industrialism can greatly add to the quality of many peoples’ lives, but this does not mean it is the only way of life.  In our country, we have become dependent on the industries and this is our way of living here.  In other countries, the quality of life might not be great as we perceive it, but in the eyes of those people it is sufficient.  The quality of life in any nation rests in the motivation and will of the people of that country.</p>

===message:I don’t believe people’s lives are better today than they were 100 years ago.  I do believe that people today are accustomed to today’s technology, as were the people who lived in the early 1900’s, they to were accustomed to the technology of that time with very little fear of air, land, and water pollution.  
<p>
Industrialization has improved the lives of people because we are now able to work smarter, not harder.  Think of Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin.  Before the cotton gin was invented, the workers of cotton farmer’s (slaves) were unable to prepare cotton quick enough for the European demand.  Because the demand was high, mass production was needed in order to prepare the cotton for the requested demand.  With the invention of the cotton gin, the machine was able to prepare almost 50% more cotton than the average slave.  This is the case with many inventions (tractors, lawn mower, etc…) created since the early 1900s.  The machines are able to produce more or function better than humans or animals.
<p>
Although there were benefits to industrialization, there are also side effects.  For instance, humans have to be trained and skilled to use machines.  Since machines are more effective than humans, manufacturers don’t need as much human labor, thus creating a reduction in the labor force.  Another side effect to industrialization, which could potentially be a health hazard, is the pollution generated from the manufacturing plant.  Our air is polluted heavily by equipment and resources used by manufacturers.  Although industrialization created an economic benefit, is it more important than our health.

===message:I think that people’s lives are a lot better now than they were 100 years ago. The reason I believe this is that it is a lot easier for a person to make a living now than 100 years ago. A century ago most people were put into a mold, what I mean by that is, were you almost always went into the family business and today a person can choose any career they want or have the brains and gumption to go after. The industrial age has improved our lives to point were we live longer, are in better health and more freedom to enjoy our lives. The negative impact is that we have given up the family unit or at least the family unit as it used to be. Before the industrial age we were forced to rely on one another and the family unit was more important than it is now. 

A nation doesn’t have to be industrialized to be great but it is one of the ways. A great nation can be any nation depending on the individual and what they consider great. As an example some of the tribes in Africa live the same way they have for centuries and they consider it a great nation. Other nations, as in the middle east, consider a great nation one that has nuclear weapons and others consider a nation great if it has a lot government sponsored social programs like Sweden or the former USSR.

The connection between industrialization and imperialism is the need for resources. For an industrialized country to grow it is going to need a lot of resources and the best way to get those resources is to expand into other areas or country’s. To control those resources you must control the area or country that they are in, if you do not, you leave yourself vulnerable to having those resources cut off.

Although this wasn't the case for all workers, it gives a great example of the need for industrialization. Industrialization has improved the lives of people in many ways. Due to the production of machinery, people don't have to work near as hard as they used to. There are many more luxuries for people to enjoy. Many large corporations have been established which has opened up more opportunities and made a great deal of money.

Air pollution is one of the greatest concerns, but one that society has learned to deal with in order to enjoy the luxuries and necessities of today. I believe that societies must be industrialized in order to be great. That is my opinion and all I have ever known. No offense to anyone out there, but I would never want to live like the Amish.

===message:Except in the case of pollution, the benefits of industrialization have outlasted its negative impacts. The changes brought on by the Industrial Revolution were so radical and so rapid that they created enormous difficulties within societies undergoing industrialization. However, the long-term effects on standards of living have been overwhelmingly positive. 
	
<p>
It is very easy, at first glance, to overemphasize the more horrible aspects of the early Industrial Revolution: the extreme poverty and hardship experienced by the poorest laborers, compared to the extreme wealth and privilege of the “captains of industry.” The disparities between upper class and working class replaced previous disparities between nobility and commoner, and before that, lord and serf. Those without power are ever exploited by those with power, whatever its manifestation. However, in the case of the Industrial Revolution, corrections of the abuse of power began quickly and continue still, based on the Enlightenment ideals that brought such political change during the same era.
<br>
	
<br>
Contrary to the predictions of Karl Marx, underconsumption has never been a problem in capitalist societies. One of the ways in which industrialization improved standards of living was the increase in buying power of the average person. Advanced technologies and increased productivity lowered prices of everything from clothing to cars. Even as purchasing ability has increased, so has demand increased, keeping pace with technology. We now live in societies driven by consumerism and disposability, concepts completely alien to the people of the eighteenth century.
	
<p>
Another improvement of the Industrial Revolution was class mobility. No longer doomed to live and die within the socioeconomic class in which we were born, we now have the ability to improve our situations through education and entrepreneurial pursuits.  Gender roles have also changed dramatically over the last two centuries, first moving women into the workforce and gradually improving equality of the sexes in opportunity and earning ability.
	
<p>
The connection between industrialization and imperialism lies in the availability of resources and markets. Great Britain possessed the advantage of abundant coal mines that helped get the Industrial Revolution started, and the further advantage of colonies from which to import raw materials and to which to export manufactured goods. Imperialism was justified with the claim that the possession of colonies benefited industrialization, but the strength of industrialized nations, especially Great Britain, allowed them to dominate less developed areas, so that industrialization supported imperialism instead.

===message:From the perspective of the entire creature comforts available today as compared to one hundred years ago, yes. Automobiles, municipal services, medical advances, scientific advances, electronics, inventions of all types that would have been considered science fiction even fifty years ago all make for a seemingly comfortable existence. All these contribute to not having to rely on backbreaking labor for the basic survival needs of food, shelter, clothing, medical care and transportation like no other period in history. With the proper amount of money, an average person can enjoy a plethora of pursuits unavailable to the average person a hundred years ago.
<p>
From the perspective of the price humanity has paid for the industrial revolution and everything that has evolved from it over the last hundred years, no. The industrial revolution brought environmental pollution that has evolved from dumping human waste in the water supplies and the burning of fossil fuels to cancer causing chemicals (PCB’s), pesticides (DDT) to nuclear waste products. The number of contaminants released into the environment on a worldwide basis today makes the pollution of a hundred years ago miniscule by comparison. 
<p>
Fertilizers and pesticides increased crop production at the cost of pollution created by the fertilizers and the pesticides. The DDT that was sprayed 30 years ago is still in the environment. The nutritional content of food decreased dramatically with the widespread use of fertilizers and pesticides, also. Juicers become more popular each year because the human body cannot digest the entire food intake necessary in one day to gain the proper nutritional value. The use of antibiotics and hormones to quickly raise poultry and beef has devastating effects on human health, also. Last but not least, food additives such as aspartame (NutraSweet) have toxic effects on many humans. When exposed to heat aspartame breaks down into two toxic chemicals, methanol and formaldehyde. I wonder if all that Diet Coke baking in the Saudi Arabian sun and the appearance of Gulf War Syndrome twelve years ago are coincidences?
<p>
Mammoth corporations, financial institutions, and a huge Federal government that is unfairly influenced by them have replaced the abuses of robber barons. In order to survive the average person must participate in the society that has evolved from industrialism. Personal privacy and the basic freedoms spawned by Enlightenment thinkers and the US Constitution erode more each decade. Satellites watch us from above; the NSA has a computer that scans every telephone conversation for certain keywords, and the Carnivore program for scanning email (mentioned in the “Swordfish” movie) is now part of our daily lives. It is almost impossible to transact business without a Social Security number, yet participation in Social Security is “supposed” to be voluntary. 
<p>
Many diseases, afflictions, and/or maladies predominant in today’s society were not so dominant as little as fifty years ago. Heart disease, arthritis, diabetes, and cancer top the list, with new diseases such as AIDS and SARS possibly having a genesis from the effects of industrialism.
<p>
Mental illnesses, such as Borderline Personality Disorder, were rare fifty years ago and almost nonexistent a hundred years ago. Many inmates within the prison systems are diagnosed with personality disorders and violent crime has steadily increased the last hundred years. Prozac and other SSRI’s are prescribed by Primary Care Physicians on a routine basis. 
<p>
This increasingly interdependent world is increasingly fragmented by more hate and mistrust between nations, ethnic groups, religions, and races with a corresponding decline in the moral and ethical behavior of leaders in the most industrialized of countries.  It would seem that man’s technological prowess grows by leaps and bounds on an almost daily basis while the evolution of the species itself has, at best, stagnated during the same time period.
<p>
A nation’s greatest resource is its people. The greatness of a nation is determined by the content of character of its people and leaders. Industrialization can help a nation to become powerful, but the people of the nation are the determining factor of how long a country stays powerful.
<p>
Imperialism was used as a way to propagate industrialism. Britain did not have the natural resources to produce everything it needed to fuel industrial growth. Imperialism provided access to raw materials from colonies and markets to sell finished products.

===message:The connection between imperialism and industrialization is this: He who industrializes first, imperializes first. He who trys to imperialize with no industrialize...imperializes last! :)  I think nations are compelled to industrialize (or build strong ties with someone who is) so that they won't risk being taken over. 

In other words, industrialization is the strength to imperialism. You need the latest and greatest resources, machinery, tools, communication devices/tactics, etc. to get to the place where you are able and confident to conquer and then dominate (rule). For instance, the British subdued the Sudanese at Omdurman near the Nile River with twenty machine guns and six gun boats virtually wiping out the Sudanese using the latest weaponry, and sailing vessels equiped with machine guns and explosive charges. The damage in five hours of fighting: Britain lost 368, Sudanese 11,000.

I think our quality of life is challenged quite often by the latest and greatest gadgets, machinery, computers, etc. People lose jobs because of new machinery. They no longer need physical hands when everything can be automated! Or, the number of workers are reduced drastically. Ironically, even though new equipment and computers are present, some others still work longer hours stealing away valuable family time, or sociable relaxation time. Many people seemed to be overworked and stressed due to long hours at the office, extensive travelling, and the push to work longer, to get more done with faster tools of the trade.

Today, people are greedy, materialistic, unappreciative, and abuse the things that they do have.  Most people are never satisfied with the necessities.  There are too many other things out there to acquire.
<p>
I do believe industrialization has improved the lives of people.  There is so much technology out there.  Look how far we have come.  Airplanes flying in the air, stoves to cook on, computers for homework (and classwork), medicines to cure many ailments, and so much more.  Industrialization is a great entity.  There is always a down-side to most everything.  I do think as machine-oriented everything is, that it has cut back on manpower.  Less jobs for the actual human body.  Things that were totally manual labor are now completed with the touch of a button.  Who's willing to give up the luxuries that they have?  Probably not many of us.
<p>
In my own little world, I would say that people make a nation great.  We all know that power, industrialization, and politics are more likely to do the job.  The more a country has and its exploitation of it, the greater it is.
<br>
I believe industrialization relies heavily on imperialism.  If it were not for imperialism and countries trying to extend their influence through foreign trade, there would be a lot less need for industrialization.  It's that greed factor again.  What can we sell to other countries, to make more money, to gain other commodities, to have more power, to be a greater nation?

===message:I hate to appear to be over simplifying, but it seems to me that one need only consider the difference in average life expectancy now as compared to one hundred years ago to realize that life is better in today’s world.  According to the National Center for Health Statistics the average life expectancy in 1900 was 47.3 years of age.  In 2000 it was 76.9 years of age.  Industrialization led not only to better diets and improved sanitation, which had an immediate and lasting effect on mortality rates, but it also opened the doors to the philosophy of constant improvement and growth.  Technological and medical advancements had their conception in the ideas that were realized in the earliest stages of industrial progress.   I am eternally grateful to those who came before me for their ingenuity and genius, in no small part because of the conveniences that I enjoy, but  more for the opportunities given to me for greater health throughout my life.  
<p>
While pollution and various forms of environmental destruction that can and do result from industrial progress are a very legitimate concern, we are fortunate to live in such an enlightened time that these issues are receiving the attention that they deserve.  Preservation of nature while still moving forward technologically will prove to be yet another advancement that had it’s roots in the birth of the industrial society.    
<p>
Does industrialization make imperialism probable?  One could make a case that greater ease of production and a richer society could open such doors, but I do not believe that it is possible or desirable to stop progress due to this possibility.  Industrialization goes a long way in making a nation great as it gives the population an improved standard of living.  Some argue that there are still countries that do not have access to such luxuries.  Perhaps we should give these people more credit for their ability to make decisions and realize that a great deal of their situation is a result of their choices.

How has it negatively impacted them? Notice that industrialization first occurred in Great Britain, a strong country that had many colonies. Must nations be industrialized in order to be great? What's the connection between industrialization and imperialism? 



Without a doubt!  I feel the lives of today are better than it was 100 years ago.  Though we have had major complication, the advancements of today in technology, medicine, birth control and human rights have surpassed those of 100 years ago.

Though the industrial age has improved the lives of most not all it has not had the benefit of all.  The industrial age created a new era in the work force and the world.  Though many advancements have caused millions of jobs and various other sacrafices.  The industrial age has opened up another realm of work.  The use of the mind.  Thier are still millions of workers who still work as hard laborers but the industrial age concentrated on speed of the product making versus manual laborer.  What it took hundreds of workers to assemble now only takes a few monitioring a machine.  

Yes I feel in today's measurement of a great nation it must be industrialized.  The measurement of a great nation is measured in how important it is to the world not just its region.  Case in point IRAQ. In spite of its dictorship it is looked upon as a great nation because of its OIL deposits.

My opinion of industrialization and imperialism is that the industrialization was built on the corporation effect.  The few controling the many wich is exactly how imperialism works.

===message:I think in some ways today’s standard of living is better than what they were one hundred years ago. I feel that a persons overall well being is what you should use to determine if their live is better off, not just the amount of material accumulation or how long that particular person may live. Take for example an upper middle class family. As a result of industrialization the children of this family can attend private schools, their parents can drive nice cars; the family can live in a spacious house and have all the material comforts of the upper middle class. Things that were not exactly readily available such as cars, an exceptional education for their children and leisure time for the entire family to enjoy can now be hand. 
On the down side you take a look at this same upper middle class family and see that even though their children are going to good private schools they are exposed to things such as drug use, seeing as that they have the money to purchase it, sex, seeing as that they have the time for it and a multitude of other things that available to those with idle hands. The time that the parents spend making this money takes away from the time that could be spent with their children teaching them how to attempt to be relatively good people who can do without what’s bad for them. Less family time and lower standards I feel are the negative impact of the industrialization. 
But as I said before it all depends on how you determine what exactly better off means. With the good that has come there is, in my opinion, just as much bad. I feel that in order for a nation to be economically great they will have to be to a certain extant industrialized. An agricultural nation can be great, BUT they would need the materials necessary to export or trade with other nations. Carts and horses would not be good enough. I think once a land was found to be hiding some kind of natural resource, be it gold, iron, wood, a very tasty fish that’s hard to find, there will need to be some way of acquiring test resources. In order to do that you need to put people to work. Then also if you have a nation that is already industrialized you will eventually have those people who want to expand just for the sake of expansion. To see what is out there and be somewhere different than where they are then. You can have imperialism without industrialization and industrialization without imperialism but both benefits from each other. I suppose I just did a big ole ramble.

I could never imagine having no computers, efficient cars, microwaves, televisions, etc. all making my life better and easier to live. Our country would consist of a great number of people who would not get an education after high school, assuming they could get that far. One hundred years ago most Americans still were farmers. If your family were in aggregation then you followed in your parents footsteps. At the age of 14, the men worked in the farms and quit school until the industrial revolution. This brought better jobs and better opportunities to further education which led to make lives better for everyone.

Although industrialization has improved our lives, it has also negatively impacted our lives as well. I have to agree to a pervious message I read from Diane Mercer. Industrialization has taken away the appreciation for what we need for life such as clothes, food, water, etc.

Due to the great number of countries moving into the industrial stage, there is a need to be industrialized to be a better country. Industrialization has made it better to trade, travel, and communicate with there own country as well as other industrialized countries. This is what connects industrialization to imperialism. The spread of our country's ideas and the learning of other countries' ideas have become easier and more useful due to industrialization and the more accessible ways to communicate.

Nations don't necessarily have to be industrialized to be great, but it helps a great deal.  In today's society and back then money is what makes them powerful.  The more money the greater other countries see them.  Industry is what makes the money and gets them seen as higher up in the greater scheme of things.  If they're the sole producer of many things in an industry they're thought of as great by the majority.  So industry does tend to make a country great.  Imperialism is the expanding of European powers to Asia and Africa.  This was done with the help of industrialization.  The would use the goods from these countries and industrialize them.

For example a couple may be able to sit at home or in a library and communicate with their child in the military via email. This is one tool that has helped the improvement of people lives. 
 I believe that industralization has negatively impacted  people's lifestyle in doing so it has negatively and failed to give people an "alternative." To explain further, with new technology people are not use to the "old way" of doing things. In the past there was the long drawn out  method of doing things and that was it. There was no shortcuts. 
 However today we are so accustomed to our lifestyles and new technology that we are not aware of any alternatives. In my opinion, this has negatively impacted the people.
 I do feel that a nation has to be industralized to be great. This contributes to power and the economy. This allows the people to be able to grow, produce and look forward to change and embrace new ideas and new technology. Nations must be industralized to be great to stay demanding, and powerful.
 I believe industralization relies heavy on imperalism. The influence on foreign trade, foreign affairs, and the relationship with other foreign countries are necessary to continue to secure the power and gain commodities for our country. This is very important and vital to our countries' resources.

===message:     I would have to say that our lives are better today compared to those of 100 years ago.  The introduction of industry into society was a major adjustment.  Inventors were trying to come up with mechanisms that would be able to produce goods faster and at a minimal cost.  The first factories were death traps.  The workers endured ridiculously long hours with substandard pay in return.  Many rural farmers flocked to major cities to earn more money and found themselves in congested urban jungles, with major sanitation problems.  But through industrialization, child labor laws were instituted and education became a huge priority.  Also, industry encouraged women to be more devoted to their traditional roles as wife, mother, and caretaker of the home.  With that said I don’t know if our lives are better today than theirs’ were.  Certainly today, women work in industry.  They are also expected to perform as well as men and care for the household and children.  

	I could go on for hours about the many advantages of an industrialized society.  I don’t think that a second goes by in our lives without the aide of industry.  It’s everywhere.  From the cars we drive, clothes we wear, to the quick meals that are made for on the go people, the fingerprint of industry is highly visible.

	In today’s society we are always looking for the quick fix.  We are such a microwave society that everything has to be hot, fast, and now.  We don’t have time to slow down and if we did, it would probably feel like a century had passed.  I believe that industry has handicapped our society in many respects.  Traditions and customs are lost easily to manufactured knock-offs.

	I think a great nation is able to capitalize on its own wealth and the wealth they acquire from smaller ones.  Great Britain had a lot of control in the Caribbean and other smaller seaports and took full advantage.  Great Britain as well as other larger countries used their technologies, financial influence, and transportation networks to obtain the raw materials needed from the pre-industrial societies around the world.  Because industrialized countries dominated the established commercial and financial institutions that were associated with trade, smaller nations had little control over their own natural resources.  This is a great example of the connection between industrialization and imperialism.

===message:People's lives today are much better off than our ancesters one hundred years ago. In this day and age things are much simpler to attain than years past. There are government departments that will step in and help those that are unable to help themselves. Families are no longer required to rely on the help and work of their children. There are standards in the workplace that must be adhered to. People no longer have to take the abuses against themselves or family members just to make enough to eat. Most people nowadays want to aquire the things that will make their lives simpler but are things not necessary for survival. Industrialization has had negative impacts on us. We have created polution that is affecting our health and will affect the health of generations to come. We have changed the global landscape by deforestization and will change the global climates due to the pollution. I think nations must be industrialized in order to compete with other industrial nations. If that is not a requirement for those nations than no they do not need to be industrialized. There are people that have not had contact with modern equipment and are still surviving. They survive off the bare necesseties and have no interest in knowing the modern way to do things.

===message:Yes.  I beleive that today people have better lives than people's lives one hundred years ago.  Today we work less hours, have better paying jobs and benefits, which were all part of what the German's initiated to keep people from seeking jobs in the Americas.  According to the history explained in this chapter, the concept of producing and trading goods that were in demand in other countries was a simbolism of greatness.  It brought stability and increased the economy of the Country.
