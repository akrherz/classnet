===message:One of the legacies of imperialism is freedom for most of the world. I know this sounds like a contradiction to the fact that imperialism is all about control. The way it seems to me is that as nation went from small undeveloped countries to mighty nations they had to give more responsibility and freedom to individuals in making the choices that are made. Some of this responsibility and freedom had to be given to individuals in the conquered nation. As these nations learned from the conquering nation they then received the benefits of the industrial age much faster than they would have received them on there own. With the advancements of industries and technology the amount of control by another nation will grow less.  As information is received by the population of the imperial nations about the human rights violations forced on the less developed nations these violations will be forced to stop. As an example of this I submit slavery, as far as I know it is illegal all over the world. This is a human rights violation that was outlawed due to the advance of imperial nations.

===message:Two primary legacies that imperialism contains are control and industrial growth.  First the nation, such as Britain, had to go into the un-colonized land and take control.  Either by force through war, or threw ties with communication, Britain did this to gain rule of lands suitable for economical or political gain.  After the conquered land became colonized, then it became a great source for industrial and economic growth.  This growth produced tremendous industries in lands all over the world.  This trend was the European's way to gain power and control in the lands for industrialization. Imperialism did many European nations good as it brought them mass production of goods and business for commerce around the world.  It is difficult to say how imperialism can be justified.  If we look closely at the beliefs that the Europeans had during the time of imperialism, then it would be easy to understand why they felt so justified at colonization.  Since the Europeans believed that their morals and way of life were so much more dignified than those of the African, Asian, and Pacific islanders, it gave them a relatively defensible reason to colonize.  Whether this view was right or not, imperialism was a high priority for all Europeans.
<br>
<p>World history has revolved around these issues of developed nations trying to control lesser-developed nations for thousands of years.  Whether it has been leaders trying to create vast empires like Napoleon or Hitler, or colonization as the French and English, nations and people have been trying to gain control of other lands since the dawn of history.  I believe that this happens when a nation has the desire to expand its boundaries or promote their way of life in other lands.  The Greeks and Romans did this back before pre-modern times.  Some rulers just seek wealth and power.  The effects of nations in the past have brought the world where it is today.  As we look back on history, we can either learn to admire the way of the past or ignore it.  One thing that people should do is learn from the experiences of history and apply them to the present. </p>

===message:Imperialism brought about the advancement of society on a larger scale with technology, medicine, agriculture,and horticulture.It also revolutionized race relations and transformed the modern world into what it is today: the taking of land, wealth, and labor of indigenous peoples, leading to their near extermination, and the transatantic slave trade, which created a racial underclass.Imperialism has caused smaller countries to be engulfed into a larger collective with the idea of expanding. It helped smaller countries to connect with other countries and it helped to better the means of trading with other countries.It could be justified by the means of countries connecting globally.

===message:<p>The legacies of imperialism involve industrialization, domination and exploitation. There were many reasons giving for imperialism, from economic motives to religious reasons. 
However, Imperialism involved the domination of a nation’s people in order to exploit their country’s resources, which were used during the Industrialization Revolution.</p> 

<p>History has revolved around issues stemming from imperialism, as it has been the cause of many conflicts and wars. The World Wars were a result of countries wanting to dominant less powerful countries. The Vietnam War occurred because the Vietnamese no longer wanted to be dominated by the French. This past century alone has seen many countries struggle for independence from greater nations. </p>

<p>I agree with John Locke’s theory of contractual government and hence I believe that there is no justification for imperialism.  For people to lead or rule other people they should be looking out for the best interest of the people those people. Imperialism, even through some claimed it to be noble, was merely the exploitation of people not strong enough to defend themselves. Imperialism would be justifiable if developed countries had made an attempt to look out for the people the imposed their will on, rather than just exploit them and their countries.</p>

===message:The legacies of imperialism are economic and social change, large scale labor migrations and colonial conflict associated with control or power. Imperial powers shaped the economies and societies of their colonies by pushing them to supply natural resources and agricultural commodities in exchange for manufactured products. They also created multi-cultural societies around the world by facilitating the movement of workers to lands with a high demand for labor.(p. 962) Many conflicts arose between colonies and imperial powers such as the Maji Maji Rebellion or the Sepoy Rebellion. These people were tired of being under imperial rule. The imperial powers were on a power trip and the interest of the people was not an issue at that time. 

World history has revolved around issues stemming from imperialism since the early twentieth century. When people began to develop a sense of national identity, such as the Indian nationalism and independence movements, the stage was set for anticolonial campaigns in other lands. 

As far as imperialism being justified, given the ideals of freedom and popular sovereignty, no it can not be justified. John Lockes idea of popular sovereignty stated that individuals granted political rights to their rulers, but retained personal rights to life, liberty and property. If this was violated by any ruler, they were subject to deposition. This was not the case with imperialism. Imperial powers came in to dominate the people and often by force for trade, investment, and business activities that profited them. This does not even relate to the ideals of popular sovereignty or freedom so, how could it be justified?

===message:The imperialism of European powers, and later of the American and the Japanese, left a legacy of negative affects on the economies of the dominated area.  Because the indigenous peoples could not protect their interests against imperial advance, lands were transferred to direct or indirect control of the imperial powers, cultivation in the colonized lands was shifted from subsistence crops to cash crops in order to serve the agricultural needs of the peoples of Europe, laborers were dislocated from their land into areas where they might be more productive toward the goals of the imperialist power, and the natural resources of the land were extracted as wealth for the imperial power or raw materials for it’s industry. European industrially manufactured goods helped wiped out local crafts and industries, and indigenous lands and people were reduced to the status of resource-providers. 
<p>
While some improvements did result from the spread of imperialist rule, it would be speculation to try to determine where these nations would be today if not for the intrusion of those scrambling for territory so it cannot be justified in view of the enlightenment ideals of the time.  Due to Europeans’ racist views of superior intelligence and morality some felt those ideals applied only to themselves while others believed that they were providing a service to the natives of dominated areas by civilizing them.

===message:Nationalism and modern racism are the legacies of imperialism.  European people considered themselves superior to other races throughout the world, and they used their tools and weapons to expand their control.
<p>
Several motives such as economics, political, and cultural justifications encouraged imperialism.  According to our book, some advocates argued that imperialism was in the economic interests of European societies as well as individuals.(936)  In order to get the economic benefits of trade, imperial states felt they had to control the trade of its colonies because certain raw materials weren’t available in Europe.
<p>
When European states expanded their influence to the colonies, they kept some colonies for political reasons only although there was no economic benefit attached.  Sometimes it was merely to diffuse social tension.  The same goes for cultural justification.  Many times missionaries went to other countries and colonies in search of converts to Christianity.  In addition, some missionaries were resources or spies who gathered information to report back to European officials to help maintain control.
<p>
Imperialism cannot be justified given the ideals we learned in chapter 30.  Expansion of imperialism came from the force and control of larger nations over smaller third world countries.

===message:Imperialism may be defined as the imposition of control over a group of people denying them the freedom to make their own decisions. What are the legacies of imperialism? How has world history revolved around issues stemming from imperialism, when lesser-developed countries are controlled by developed countries? How can imperialism be justified, given the ideals of freedom and popular sovereignty that we read about in Chapter 30? 

Imperialism dates back to ancient times it was just under other names.  As the industrial age grew stronger and great mineral finds and enourmous growth in other regions were found the domination of the weeker regions help mold history as it is today.  Many forget how the diamond and gold deposits found in Africa encouraged and fueled slavery.  The inventions of stronger and powerful machines allowed the stronger countrie to dominate and demolish many regions and claim them as thier land.  In the struggle to retake of overthrow the domininant regime in the country many historical battles and leaders rose from the ashes.  The only justification for these disguised imperialist acts is in the name of progress..  Many of my classmates refer to the good that came out of these imperialistic acts as if the people who inhabitat the areas just enjoyed the imperialist wealth and prosperity.  Thier seems to be a missing element or either they feel if its not spoke of it did not happen..  I personally feel it is never justified.  Some times just leave people along or if interviention is needed it should be shared by the population that allready exist in the region.  Case and point our current IRAQ imperialistic action.  We can say oh IRAQ people will be so much better but truly what cost and what rewards will the IRAQ people really get other than slaving for the greater powers.  Are we going to give every citizen a share of the oil or will they still have to go to work and work for the conquering nation to get a check!

===message:The legacies of imperialism are industrialization, migration and nationalism.  Industrialization and migration significantly promoted the spread of imperialism.  Nationalism in turn sometimes accidentally developed as a cause of imperialism.  World history has always had something to do with the issues of imperialism.  Enslavement is a good example of this.  Whether they admit it or not, part of the imperialist view was that slavery is ok.  A large scale coupe of countries is another example of imperialistic views.   Imperialism can be justified, given the ideals of freedom and popular sovereignty if the reason for seizing the country was to free its inhabitants from a tyrannical government.  Unfortunately none of the imperialist coupes I read had anything to do with this.

===message:Now to address the question about the legacies of imperialism, etc. I think the legacies of imperialism are numerous. We experience as a country and individually many  influences of the European ways of life regarding education, standards of living (capitalism), cultural (various influences in our heritages), economic and even political. But as well, we suffer the repercussions of imperialism from a negative standpoint. For example, many countries view us as the "evil imperlistic empire", a big ape, pushing our way through the jungle somewhat flexing our "middle muscle" upon the little guy (Iraq) for our own vested middle east interests. I think history has set the pace for imperialist nations to appear as bullies as due their actions upon others. Unfortnately, we are in that position now as others see us.

===message:The legacies of imperialism are racisms that are facilitated everyday in some part of the world. It's still taught in the US. Our war with the Middle East is some form of imperialism. We (US forces that be) don't like the way you do things so we must go to war with you. World history has revolved around those issues because of greed and natural resources. When the Europeans came to the Americas they controlled the native people. Trying to convince them that the European way was the way to be. It was taught that it was the only way. Imperialism cannot be justified in my opinion. The ideals of freedom and popular sovereignty cannot be imposed under imperialistic ways. The people making the decisions are not necessarily making the decisions based on popular sovereignty. They are not necessarily making decisions that means equality and freedom for all. The people that created the United States of America felt that they were imposing equality and freedom to all. That is, all that they considered worthly. Slaves and women didn't have the same rights as those founding fathers.

If there is a problem war is the answer. It always seem as if greed is always a factor along with the power and control to obtain resources the reasons we have war.This is not a good reason to fight for your country.Freedom and popular sovereignty is unheard under imperialistic ways. The decisions in this form of government are not looking out for the freedom or well being of the people. People are considered worthless and slaves.

===message:I would have to agree strongly with others by stating that the legacies of today is racism. We are taught in society that our country is the best.  Being taught this, we also a lead to believe that our individual groups in our country are also better than any other. We believe this so strongly that we want to control other groups because we think our beliefs are the best. We are then taking freedom from other people who think differently. 

America is known for speaking up for the countries that are more dependent than independent. For example, Israel has been taken advantage of, but America was there to control the issue. Throughout history other good nations has done the same.

I believe that imperialism can not be justified, and the word unjustified should be thought of when you hear of imperialism. Freedom and popular sovereignty are unobtainable when imperialism is expressed due to the large amount of control involved.

With the onset of these new territories came waterways that made newly discovered land accessible.  And now with more accessibility came industry.  Lesser-developed countries continue to struggle because they have not established themselves as truly “independent” nations.  They rely on the outside influences.  How many nations have outstanding loans owed to the United States?  They have not been able to utilize their own natural resources in order to gain economic freedom.
