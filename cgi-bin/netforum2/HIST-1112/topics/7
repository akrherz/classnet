===more:Look at the pictures of paintings on pages 1002, 1008 and 1009, as well as the photos on pages 1014 and 1026.  How did art and these photos reflect the changing world of the Age of Anxiety?  What are the sources of anxiety during this turbulent age? Why did fascism, communism, and nationalism all seem to thrive during these uncertain times?
