===message:In my opinion, the Europeans benefited the most from the Columbian exchange. The Europeans were the first group of people to travel back and forth to the Americas on a regular basis so the products of the Columbian exchange would have more time and opportunity to proliferate in Europe. The American food crops were definitely needed in the European diet. Potatoes, for instance, became such a staple in Ireland that later potato famines in that country were devastating.
 

The most important "gift" to the Americas was disease. Smallpox, almost single-handedly, ravaged the Aztec empire. The Incas were pretty much wiped out by diseases, also. Estimates of one hundred million deaths between 1500 and 1800, arguably the worst demographic calamity in history, far away make disease the most profound "gift" to the Americas.

===message:	The Europeans definitely and overwhelmingly gained most from the Columbian Exchange. Although the exchange of plants and animals fueled a worldwide surge in population (631), European populations experienced the greatest benefit. The Columbian Exchange had little effect on Asia, especially on the stable and centralized societies in China and Japan. American food crops helped increase agricultural production and fueled population growth, while global trade stimulated their economies, but overall did not drastically alter their politics, cultures, or religions (750). American food crops had little demographic effect on the Islamic empires, but the Ottoman and Safavid empires did consume sugar and tobacco produced in the Americas and sold by Europeans (764-765). While they gained peanuts and manioc, which helped boost their population, African societies – especially those West African societies between Angola and Senegal – lost some sixteen million individuals to the Atlantic slave trade, diverting labor, distorting gender ratios, and forever altering the patterns of African politics and society (713-714). In the Americas, the Columbian Exchange brought epidemic diseases that decimated the Aztec and Inca empires and left them vulnerable to the conquistadores (670-673). The wheat and domesticated animals that the Europeans brought with them (630) did not benefit the disappearing indigenous American populations so much as they aided the Europeans who came to mine and farm the depopulated land. In contrast to the devastating effects of the Columbian Exchange on American and African peoples, Europeans gained much with little loss. The Dutch, English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese all extended their empires to include North, Central, and South America. Their populations grew as a result of new food crops, while they enriched themselves through trade and mining enterprises (693) and the cultivation of cash crops: tobacco, sugar, indigo, rice, and cotton (686). Europeans migrated, displacing populations in North America and mingling with indigenous peoples in Central and South America, until the entire hemisphere fell under European domination. The Columbian Exchange was heavily one-sided, in favor of the Europeans.
<p>
The most important “gift” from the Americas was the land and its resources: the combination of the food crops that increased the population of the world and the cash crops that stimulated economies in Europe and Asia. Europe’s climate made it unsuitable for the cultivation of sugar, tobacco, indigo, and rice – all cash crops that flourished in the Caribbean. Maize and potatoes, native to the Americas, increased the caloric intake of Europeans and Asians, while beans, tomatoes, and peppers added nutrients, flavor, and variety to their diets (630). The global exchange of food crops and animals contributed to the rise in human populations, the cultivation of cash crops enriched the Europeans who produced and traded them, and the possession of American lands gave rise to globe-spanning European empires.
<p>
For the many benefits the Columbian Exchange contributed to the European way of life, the native Americans received in return the destruction of their cultures, societies, and populations by disease, displacement, and conquest. When the conquistadores arrived in Central and South America, they found two powerful imperial states: the Aztec empire in Central America and the Inca empire in South America. Hernán Cortés, although he benefited from divisions among the indigenous peoples of Mexico, was successful in his siege of Tenochtitlan due to a smallpox epidemic which ravaged the Aztec society until it was no longer able to function. In Peru, smallpox had taken a heavy toll among Andean populations long before Francisco Pizarro arrived. He took advantage of disputes among the ruling house of the Incas, seized, and murdered them in his quest for Inca gold (672-673). Smaller societies in the Caribbean were forced to work as conscripted laborers for the Spanish settlers until they were completely wiped out by the ravages of epidemic disease – after which slaves were imported from Africa, completely replacing the extinct indigenous populations (670). In North America, dozens of distinct Algonquian, Iroquois, and Lakota societies were displaced by English, French, German, Irish, and Dutch settlers who staked claimed to “unused” American lands. Native peoples frequently clashed with the settlers over the intrusions into their hunting grounds. The combination of virulent disease and violent conflict dramatically reduced the indigenous population of North America from several millions to a few hundred thousands (676-678). Eventually, European migrants radically transformed the social order where they founded their colonies and extended their empires. In North America, native peoples were scorned as “lazy heathens” and African slaves were despised as inferior beings. English settlers sought to keep sharp boundaries between themselves and peoples of American and African ancestry, while replicating and extending English society at their expense. In South America, in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies, mixed societies arose to replace the decimated indigenous cultures (679-680). Through disease, displacement, and conflict, indigenous American societies were completely devastated, while the European societies which brought about their destruction benefited enormously from their lands and resources.

===message:<p>I believe that the Americans benefited the most from the Columbian exchange.  It is very noticeable that the European population jumped from 425 to 900 million by the 1800s, but what did the Americans gain?  First of all, after the exposure to infectious diseases, the American continent was devastated, but also began to build up immunities to these diseases.  After time, an American person would able to withstand a disease, such as smallpox, just as a European would.  After the initial epidemics, the communications and trade between the European and American countries began to grow greatly.</p>
<p>Another reason why the Americans benefited is the amount of livestock that was transported.  With the transfer of cattle, pigs, and chicken American people could now raise up animals to provide food for communities.  The horse could also be used in farming and travel beyond what had been previously experienced in the Americas.</p>
<p>Finally, migration has been a key factor to the production of the American community.  After the massive decline in population from the diseases, many people from all over the world came to America to begin a new life.  With them came their medicines, technologies, practices, religion, farming techniques, and many other things to add to the quality of life in America.  If it were not for migration to the Americas then this part of the world could still be unsettled and even unknown.</p>
<p>The most important “gift” from the Americas has to be the various crops from the land.  These new foods added nutritional value and new flavors to the European peoples.  This nutritional value added immensely to the population of the Europeans.</p>
<p>I would have to say that the most important “gift” to the Americas was the migration from around the world.  People from all over the world traveled to America for different purposes.  With these new people came all of their practices and traditions, which influenced how America is today.  Whether we realize it or not, migration has played a great role in the past and is continuously happening today.  That is a major reason why the United States is considered the “melting pot” today.</p>

I believe this is true not only because of the rising of the country but also because of the resources that were extremely important to the civilization of America. 

The most important gift from the Americans was maize and potatoes. The potatoes gave the Irish so much. Ireland is a very rocky terrain and the potatoes were able to grow easily there. The Irish at the time were not very significant, but the potatoes gave them strength and food which aloud them to focus on other things such as trade. Maize helped out the Asians a great deal because maize is easy to grow and can be spread out to numerous amounts of people. The Asians also liked that the crops were able to grow quick. This helped them with keeping up with their population growth.

Although horses played an enormous part of the Natives’ lives and how they lived, the diseases impacted their lives in a bigger way. During the time of the Columbian exchange, the Americans were settling in the new world and were fighting for land. This also helped the Americans. The Indians were dying fast and in great numbers.

American crops such as maize, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, peppers, peanuts and others spread to Europe, Africa, Asia and China which improved their diets and provided much needed vitamins and nutrition. This exchange of plants and animals began a surge in world population. People were recovering from disease due to the increased nutrition from the global exchange. Due to the success of the Columbian Exchange, many people migrated and settled the lands of the Americas. This was a great gift to them.

Twenty million natives died in Mexico alone from disease brought from the European nations. Millions of Africans were forcefully taken from there homes to work on European plantations in the Americas.

The New World indeed has given the Old World a great deal. But the question remains who benefited from these gifts of the New World? From the Columbian Exchange?
  Perhaps,the Eurpeans are the group of people who benefited most. They initially are the people that received the gifts of the New World and along with being first they had great advantages. Such advantages as food, crops, animals and trade. Europeans first had the experience of the global economy and had the advantages of population and growth. The cross-cultural exchange was more beneficial for Eurpeans, who gained significant new food crops.  
 The most important gift to Americans were food crops and animals. These gifts were very important because it helped increased the population of the Americas-which was dimished in the 16th century with the infectious and contagious diseases such as small pox, diptheria, and influenza. The gift of crops and animals that would promote a global spread was the most important gifts that the Americas was given. 
 The most important gift given to the native American was American crops.  The American crops took root in Africa, Asia, and Europe. This included maize, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, peppers, peanuts, manioc, papayas. Residents in the eastern hemisphere developed a taste for American crops.  By the eighteen century maize and potatoes had contribiuted to a sharply increased number of calories in a Eurasian diets. Peanuts and manioc flourished in tropical southeast Asian and west African soils that otherwise would not produce large yields or support large populations.

===message:When it comes to the Columbian exchange I would have to say that the Europeans benefited the most in the end.  The most important gift given to the Native Americans, whether good or bad, would have to be the infectious diseases. Even though the exchange promoted human population growth by the diffusion of food crops and animals, it was the reason for the decreased population of the Americas.  "Beginning in the early sixteenth century, infectious and contagious diseases brought sharp demographic losses to indigenous peoples of the Americas and the Pacific islands"(p629).  The Europeans on the other hand suffered only minor damages from such diseases.  "In the eastern hemisphere, these diseases had mostly become endemic: they claimed a certain number of victims from the ranks of infants and small children, but survivors gained immunity to the diseases through exposure at an early age"(p629).  The Americas did gain a couple good things from the exchange.  For example: "Wheat, vines, horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and chickens went from Europe to the Americas where they sharply increased supplies of food and animal energy" (p630).  Of course the Europeans gained something as well.  The most important gifts given by the Americas are products such as "maize, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, peppers, peanuts, manioc, papayas, guavas, avocados, pineapples, and cocao...."(p630).  These products contributed greatly to the European diet.  Even though this exchange of plants and animals allowed for an increase in world population, the American population still remained below those of other continents. "Beginning in 1519, epidemic smallpox ravaged the Aztec empire, often in combination with other diseases, and within a century the indigenous population of Mexico had declined by as much as 95 percent, from about twenty-one million to one million people"(p630).  Another arena where Europeans gained the most would be the distribution of its population. "Alongside disease pathogens and plant and animal species, the Columbian exchange also involved the spread of human populations, through transoceanic migration, whether voluntary or forced.... A smaller but still sizable migration involved Europeans who traveled to the Americas and settled in lands depopulated by infectious and contagious diseases.  During the nineteenth century European peoples traveled in massive numbers mostly to the western hemisphere but also to south Africa, Australia, and Pacific islands where diseases had diminished indigenous populations, ...."(p631).  So as you can now see the Europeans befitted most in all arenas of the Columbian exchange thanks to the spread of their infectious diseases.  "All told, disease epidemics sparked by the Columbian exchange probably caused the worst demographic calamity in all of world history"(p630).

===message:The Europeans definitely benefitted most from the Colunbian exchange. My first reply was okay, but I felt that I needed to enhance my response. The Columbian exchange is described as "the global diffusion of plants,
food crops, animals, human populations, and disease pathogens that took place after voyages of explorationby Christopher Columbus and other European mariners"(629). In my opinion, the Europeans benefitted most because they were the first to set off a round of biological exchange that permanently altered the world's human geography(629).
The Europeans did not suffer as many casualties during the exchange of the disease pathogens because the diseases became endemic-they claimed a certain number of victims from the ranks of infants and small children, but the survivors gained immunity to the diseases through exposure at an early age. All-in-all, smallpox posed no threat to the European society as a whole because it did not take the lives of many adults which were mostly responsibilities for economic production and social organization(629).
The most important gift from the Americas would be the crops of which were easily grown in countries such as Africa, Asia, and Europe. Consequently, Americans crops contributed greatly to the number of calories in Eurasian diets, provided vitamins, and added zesty flavors to their foods from western Europe to China(630-631).
The most important gift given to the Native Americans would have to be a tie between horses and diseases. The horses helped the Native Americans to migrate and hunt for food. On the other hand, the gift of the diseases turned out to be a detriment. In one century, the spread of diseases killed 95% of the Aztec people.
To say the least, the Columbian exchange helped decrease the population in the beginning stages of trade; however, in the long run, the exchange helped replenish the population with the spread of crops and livestock. The "New World" would be very primitive without the adventures taken by the explorers and mariners of the "Old World", and to those before us, we are thankful.

In Europe, smallpox didn't pose  a great threat because it didn't carry away adults who were responsible for econimic production and social organization (p.629).

Even before large numbers of Europeans settled in the Americas, infectious and contagious diseases had wiped out a vast population of the indigenous people.  Especially diseases like smallpox and whooping cough, which were common in their homelands of Europe.  Even if the “new” Americans acquired such diseases a smaller population would be affected, namely small children.  Most adults would be spared.  Also, with this newly unpopulated region, Americans inherited a rich agricultural legacy compliments of those few Native Americans that survived.  America was able to gain economic standing with the introduction of such crops like potatoes, peppers, and beans into the European diet, by way of trade. These and many other food crops became essential sources of nutrition for the Europeans.
     Native Americans benefited from the plant and animal life brought to the Americas by the Europeans.  With the introduction of cattle, chickens, and numerous species of plant life, Native Americans were also able to utilize these European imports.  Unfortunately, the “gift” came with a bonus prize, disease.  Many diseases made the long voyage from Europe.

===message:For thousands of years, groups such as the Egyptians, Romans and the like had been swapping goods (bartering),  taking spoilage from sub cultures, dominating and introducing and blending cultures, changing the face of peoples and the world alike. But what I think is very unique about the Columbian Exchange is that it was probably the greatest global interaction (exchange) to ever exist. Why? Because it had a "whole" affect, globally. What I mean by "whole" is that it ignited a plethora of cultural, economic and bio-logical changes that propelled the world into a new dimension and new directions forever. 

Populations transformed, cultures clashed, and economies were drastically changed forever. The eastern and western hemispheres and oceania converged to share in this global exchange. Whereas, before these areas were greatly seperated.  

Who benefited? Well...? 
Diseases that spread from Europeans wiped out populations, (the indigenous peoples of the Americas as well as other cultures), but probably set the foundation for the building of immunities, understanding diseases, the creation of vaccines, medicines, cures. Ironically, due to the spread of food crops and animals the population increased. (Keep in mind that our country's forefathers are British. Since the Europeans' intent was to establish rule and create wealth, I believe the Columbian Exchange had an impact on the Americas laying the ground work for the establishment of the "great" American democratic society.)  

As radical changes occured in the plant world new crops (such as coffee, bananas, and sugar which incidently, would play a significant role in slavery) were introduced to the Americas, as well as crops from the New World that were introduced and flourished in Africa, Asia, Europe and China adding diversity to their daily meals. Because of the nutritional value, again the populations were drastically affected in an upward fashion.

Transoceanic voyages helped increased migrations to the Americas as well as other areas. This would later play a definite role in the increase in population of the "new world".

But keep in mind that without all this, would we be the "great" country that we are today?   

Although other countries benefited and were affected, I think the greatest benefit was to the Americas, but not without a price.

===message:I think the most important gift from the Americas is the success of the crops in other areas of the world namely Africa, Asia, Europe, and China. These crops flourished so well that they added nutritional value to the diets of people and were able to support large populations, let alone I'm sure this equalled huge profit$ for the Europeans. This is always their ultimate goal!  

Not only that, whenever I travel, I am always looking for the best, tasty restaurants and places to eat. I think the success of the crops from the Americas would somehow play a role in keeping a connection to those countries for possible migration opportunities to the New World out of curiosity and developed interests.

The most important gift to the natives would be the exchange of the animals and some crops whereby increasing food supply and animal energy, which in turn would help with the population growth.

===message:In some individual's perspectives the Americas benefited the most from the exchange.  The reason for this train of thought would be that they got slaves out of the deal.  I imagine only a select few would think that and not even voice that thought.  It stemmed from the thought of "gift's" to the Native Americans.  All we really did was take things from them and give them small pox.  But there were a few things that benefited them like horses and other such animals.  It provided a new way of transportation and different kinds of protein which would help expand their life expectancy.  My opinion however would be that everyone benefited from the exchange.  They all got things out of the deal and everyone could hold something over someone else.  Either way if someone got mad everyone else was out of their good.  They all produced their own special thing that the other countries didn't have.  Because of this everyone benefited and not just one country imparticular.

===message:Although diseases claimed a vast population of American lives, the most valuable gift given to the Americans were the various types of animals brought by the Europeans. If you think about it, Iron from the red meats and calcium from the milk (along with other nutrients) of these animals must have helped build a more sufficient diet and helped the remaining Americans grow stronger. A more wholesome diet must have also boosted immune systems. On the other hand, just animals alone could not compare to what the Americans left for the Europeans. When land in America became available, Europeans were the primary benefitiaries. Migration to the North and Southern regions of the Americas made it easier for the Europeans to settle where most Americans had died out. Here, they could utilize European technology onto the American land. This essential combination paved the road for the spread of mass population of Europeans throught the Americas.

===message:Regarding the Colombian Exchange, I think that the exchange benefited Europeans, Asians, Africans, and Americans.  Eventhough the exchange brought many deseases to the Americas to which they were not exposed to nor had developed inmunity to, they gained knowledge on ne technologies and were able to trade other things that increased a helped them develop their way of living.  Europeans gained new foods that improved their diets and promoted population growth.
