===subject:Conservatism vs. Liberalism
===message:Conservatism dominates as those in power seek ever to maintain the status quo at the expense of the disenfranchised. During times of great change, such as the American and French revolutions, liberalism is ascendant, because it is the ideology that embraces change, even radical change, as progress in the quest for equality and freedom.
<p>
Over the last two centuries, liberalism has made slow but steady progress toward equality, even as the term is constantly redefined. Therefore, the repercussions of liberalism are more far-reaching than conservatism. Conservatism, though often temporarily successful, fights a losing battle against progress in its efforts to consolidate and maintain power and wealth in the hands of an elite few.
<p>
In America today, conservatism once again has the upper hand, moving us backward in time a few decades. While liberalism scrambles to find its voice, conservatism steadily increases the disparities in socioeconomic status and opportunity – in accordance with its tradition that those in power have the right to maintain it, while those without power have no right to gain it.

===message:<p>Conservatism has defiantly played a major role in the structure of the American country.  I believe that this ideology has experienced the longer lasting effects.  Over a period of time the American people began to change their view of political values and decided to become their own nation.  I would say that this idea is more important because it has lasted longer than others.  For instance, when liberalism came into France to overthrow the government, that country was in turmoil for twenty years, not being able to set up a stable government.  I am not saying there wasn’t a need for that government to change, but such a sudden change provoked destination in the land of the French.  The ideal of popular sovereignty was the major reason for many nations to seek political freedom and equality within their nation.  It brought revolution to countries in South America, the United States, the Greek, and more.</p>
<p>It is evident that these ideals are still present today, when we hear of the outbreaks in the Middle East, and of civil wars over in Africa.  These ideas will continue to be with the people of our world for time to come.  It would be impossible to eliminate the will of people to want freedom and equality, unless it were possible to erase the memory of all those who have tasted personal freedom.  As long as there is the will for popular sovereignty within the peoples of nation, freedom and equality will remain where is it wanted.</p>

Liberal John Stuart Mill also sought to extend the rights of women which has come a long way. Liberals idea of justice and society was much like it is today. Everyone has equal rights and opportunity, though some are more successful than others. The most evident aspect of liberalism today is John Stuart Mills work in extending the rights of freedom and equality to women and the working class. Women are now more active in society and politics. The working class has opportunities to work their way up career ladders and become more successful. The ideals of freedom and equality is definately evident today and has given unlimited opportunity for society to prosper.

===message:The most important revolution was the American Revolution because it was the inspiration behind the other revolutions throughout the world. Based on John Locke’s influential theories of contractual government and the ideals of Enlightenment, these ideologies changed people’s expectations of their leaders.

The American Revolution was a result of North American colonist being dissatisfied by the way in which they were being taxed by the government of England. Locke's theory made the colonist realize that the government was not looking out for their best interests as the coined the slogan "no taxation without representation." The concept of a contractual government caused the American people to declare independence from and England and look out for their own best interests. The USA has prospered ever since. The concept of a contractual government and the American Revolution also led to the revolutions in France, Haiti and South America. These revolutions were mainly caused because of dissatisfaction with leaders, and the ideals of freedom, equality and popular sovereignty.

Today the ideals of contractual government and Enlightenment have led to the quest for equality by minorities in the USA, and the government imposing laws to promote equality in the workplace and other institutions within society.

Monarchies had ruled Europe for centuries and were beginning to take hold in the American colonies because of the European interest in resources.  The timing was perfect for a new form of government.  The original intention of the Founding Fathers was to let the individual states deal with internal issues and have a limited national government to hold the states together.  This was a radical ideal considering all previous forms of government had a supreme leader whose decisions on policy were the end of all discussion.  The concept of a representative government were also radical and well received.

===message:Nationalism is definitely the most important ideal presented in this chapter.  Its presence is evident everywhere in the world.  Every land mass that has inherited a name through the years, promotes the concept of nationalism.  Every time countries go to war, they once again prove the importance of nationalism.  Without it we would just be an enormous nation with many diversities.  Nationalism established the territories we now know as countries and states.  National identity influenced the establishment of governments that promote the ideals and interest of their nation, thereby indirectly accepting the enlightenment ideal of popular sovereignty.  When we look at different countries and see the lengths their citizens go to represent their country, we can see that nationalism is still a strong force in today’s society.  Countries have fought many wars because they believe their ideals are better than their enemies.  Every human being needs to feel that they belong somewhere, whether it’s with family, gangs, friends, common religion or national identities, we feel we must belong.  Nationalist though is a very powerful force and will never vanish as long as there are human beings on this earth.

===subject:Liberalism and Enlightenment Ideals
===message:I feel that the most prominent and crucial ideology in this chapter was liberalism, at it applied to the conditions of the time.  During the era of new Enlightenment ideals, liberalism represented a concept that would allow more rights for the individual, more freedom from government control, and equality for citizens.  The liberal ideas that sparked the American Revolution in particular resulted in additional rights for individuals such as the right to bear arms, the freedom to pursue happiness and success, and the freedom to make individual decisions.  Because of the oppressed conditions of the lives of so much of the world’s population, the types of changes that were embraced and perpetuated by liberalism were an enormous benefit to the majority, allowing freedoms and equality never before experienced.   The movement toward the belief that the function of government was to serve the citizen had such a powerful effect because the masses yearned for greater fairness to the non aristocratic and/or extreme upper class portion of society.
<p>
However, I think it is important to note that over the years the ideals of liberalism and conservatism have in many ways reversed viewpoints.  Whereas at one time it was the liberal minded that believed citizens should have the right to bear arms, today it is the conservative minded that try to protect that right.  When liberal ideas were new they included greater individual rights and freedoms, whereas today the liberally minded typically believe in greater government control than those with conservative ideals.  The notion that the harder you work and the more effort you are willing to put forth should result in greater success was once a liberal idea.  Today, on the other hand, liberal ideals tend to lean toward the idea of more financial equality without regard for greater effort.   Liberal and conservative ideologies are definitely present in today’s world with liberalism still embracing change, however, not all change is good.

===subject:Enlightenment: Equality&Self Determination
===message:The Enlightenment ideal of contractual government as expressed by John Locke held that sovereignty rested with the governed, vesting power of self-determination to the people. Years later, Rousseau expanded on Locke's ideas by defining the sovereign to be all members of society and politically equal. Self-determination and equality (especially the evolved modern concept of equality) are certainly the most important ideology to alter or create new government. To implement self-determination, the defining of the rights of the various members of society (equality) would have to be addressed as a natural consequence of the self-determination process.
<br>
 
<br>
Freedom is such a natural want, desire, and/or need of human beings that self determination and equality could not be anything but an important, powerful, and permanent motivation for humans beings. Once the basic needs (food, shelter, etc.) of survival are satisfied, freedom and equality predominate as some of the more primary motivations.
<p>
 
Equality is still a strong force in the world today. In my opinion, sadly, the desire for equality in America has deteriorated to each small subset (special interest?) of society seeking "equality" for their group. Yet, what many of them continually seek is not equality, but a most favored status for their group under the guise of equality.
<p>
 
Regardless of all the "spin" generated by those with agendas, I think the recent war with Iraq is prime of example of motivations for equality and self-determination in changing or altering a government. Saddam Hussein is the same caliber tyrant as Hitler and Stalin. The fact that outside nations had the vast majority of participation in ousting him does not diminish the Iraqi citizens desire for self-determination. Many countries needed outside help to establish new governments, the United States included. Iraq is little unique in the example of equality. Terrorism and weapons of mass destruction define the world's collective participation to oust Hussein unique from WWII efforts to destroy Hitler with Aryan master ideology. This struggle for equality redefined the concept of equality as the right to be equally free from terrorism proliferated by small groups usually claiming religion as the justification, not just a despotic government.

===subject:Revolutionary Ideas:  Slavery and Women's Rights
===message:Let me start with a definition:  Equality - having the same rights or status; opportunity to be employed, paid, etc. without descrimination on grounds of sex, race, etc.
<p>
During the 1700-1800's the revolutionary ideas on slavery and women were in full force.  Equality for both was being sought.  Not by all, but especially by those who actually wanted it or those with morals about human life and equal status.  "Abolition brought freedom for African and African-American slaves, but it did not bring political equality" (827).  It would be years later before slaves were actually even given rights that would make them equal.
<p>
As the abolition of slavery was being fought for, so were women's rights.  Just another reform that would come many years later.  Take for instance, Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the 1840's.  She went to London to attend an anti-slavery conference and wasn't allowed to attend because she was a woman.  She then came back to the states to fight for women's rights.
<p>
I believe that the revolutionary ideals of slavery and women's rights intimidated many.  Thank goodness, with diligent persistence, determination, hard work ethics, and not to forget - lost lives, we have a system today that constitutes equal rights for all, no matter the gender or race.  We must remember that "all men are created equal".
I believe that it is these ideals that have had such powerful effects, effects that we can see in our every day lives, effects that have stimulated us to be who we are and shape this great country that we call "home".

===message: I think the idea of sovereignty was the most important ideology.  Sovereignty had such powerful effects because the principal of sovereignty is based on the notion that no law or rule is legitimate unless it rests directly on the consent of the individuals concerned.  The United States constitution emphasizes the rights of the people concerned.  Our federal government is drafted on the principles of popular sovereignty.
<p>
Although all American people were not granted full rights in the beginning, later with the extension of the civil rights, American society broadened the implications of the enlightened values of freedom and equality. (812)
<br>
Sovereignty is still evident today when we see elected officials voted in or out of office because the American people are either in agreement or disagreement with their political viewpoints.

===message:Just from our own government we can vouch that conservatives and liberals are contrasting ideals to one another. First, conservatism was one of the most important ideals for the forming of new governments. This is true because the conservatives were extremely cautious of what was changing in the government and took the changes in society very slowly to avoid the disaster of anarchy. (825)
On the other hand, liberalism was also one of the most important ideals when new governments were forming across the world. The liberals were determined to bring the rights back to the people. They made sure that the powerful were not too over powering to the not so powerful. Unlike the conservatives, they wanted to manage change so that it was for the best of the people. 
While conservatives and liberals are contrasting theories, they both are greatly important to have in a government. They both balance each other out to make a greater equality to society. This is true in America today. The Liberals make sure the conservatives are not letting the powerful minorities are not taking freedoms away from the less rich minorities. On the other side the conservatives are making sure that the liberals do not turn the government to anarchy due to the fast pace in change to the government.

===message:	The philosophes of the Enlightenment  collectively transformed the world’s consciousness.  They sought to find natural laws that governed human society and not the ones established by the church.  The philosophes advanced the cause of reason.  They ultimately believed that rational understanding of human and natural affairs would bring about a new era of constant progress.
	John Locke could be considered one of the most influential philosophes.  He did not oppose monarchial rule, but contended that they should be made responsible to the people they governed.  Locke’s theory of contractual government was extremely influential.  In Locke’s 1960 publication, Second Treatise of Civil Government, it explained that true government needed to be a collective effort.  He believed that in order for government to be a success, officials had to acknowledge, support, and promote the common interest of the people they served.  Locke went even further to add that even though individuals granted political rights to rulers, their own personal rights to life, liberty, and property would not be impeded.  Locke favored a society that gave the people a voice and demanded that the rulers paid attention.
	Locke’s sentiment can be seen in numerous movements of  revolutionary change.  The Declaration of  Independence is an excellent example of Locke’s assertions.  This declaration of power insists that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness be a privilege given to all men (even though this statement was not entirely inclusive).  The French third estate also echoed the freedom cries of liberty, equality, and fraternity when they established the National Assembly and declared themselves the true representatives of the French people.  Toussaint emerged form the Haitian Revolution with a constitution guaranteeing equality and citizenship to all residing in Saint-Domingue.  Later on Haiti declared its independence.
	Whenever the question of freedom, true freedom and equality, is raised I think that it is intermittently impossible not to feel a sense of urgency.  The very thought of the possibility of losing your voice in society will always spark a desire to protect that freedom at all cost.  And even with individual freedom, a collective group can show sovereignty towards a cause that encompasses their own beliefs and at the same time represents a totally inclusive viewpoint.  Also, I think that in today’s society, more than ever, we are taking an active and more vocal position as it relates to our government.  When the government or our elected officials do not represent the interest of the people we take issue with them and do not reward them in  November.

===message:The abolishing of slavery was a challenge in many ways. First of all this was unheard of and in the time period that slavery was legal this was quite a challenge to say that Slavery is being Abolished. Abolishing slavery was a bigger challenge than ending the slave trade. This was a challenge solely because owners had property rights in slaves. However owners were not the only ones that had a financial hand in keeping slavery legal. Planters and merchants, they too wanted to continue to profit from inexpensive labor. Abolition of slavery brought legal freedom for African Americans but it did not bring political equality. There was no change in the social or economic improvements for African-Americans. Again, political, economic and social power was denied. The obvious change was in freedom but the challenge of African American's power(belonging)in society is still being challenged even today.

I believe that Slavery had such a powerful effect because the event alone changed "the way of living" for a number of people. African-Americans, Slave owners, Planters and Merchants. This was a world wide event that was a big change in our history even today. Women's right also was effected by this new government and new change. Women now can be treated as equal. Even today women and African- Americans have to struggle with discrimination and prejudice.

===message:The Enlightenment period ultimately brought a lot to light that gave individuals the chance to experience popular sovereignty, individual freedom, and political and legal equality. Popular sovereignty is defined to be "the notion that legitimate political authority resides not in kings but rather in the people that make up a society". Society is defined as "a group of people who are dependent upon one another and share a common culture," in the book Power and Society:An Introduction to the Social Sciences by Thomas R. Dye. The ideal of popular sovereignty would take a man from a position, often given himself during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and making him a part of society and letting those who live in the society make amends to come to agree on the things they wish to happen in the society.Popular sovereignty is however an ideal whom John Locke wrote about in the Second Treatise of Civil Government, published in 1690, in which Locke wrote,"government arose in the remote past when people decided to work together, from civil society and appoint rulers to protect and promote their rulers but retained personal rights to life, liberty, and property. Any ruler who violated these rights was subject to despositon and because individuals voluntarily formed society an destablished government, rulers derived their authority from the consent of those whom  they governed. If subjects withdrew their consent, they had the right to replace their rulers"(808). Popular sovereignty had ultimate success because the "power" was given back to those under the power and this idea has trickled through the years to what we now call a democracy which allows us the people or society, to vote for our representatives in government offices. Individual freedom is an ideal that was not viewed as a necessary factor of life during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries because people had been under the rule of kings and such whom gave them no say so, just " do as they say". Philosophies  like Voltaire returned persecution of the minorities and the censorship of royal officials who had the power to prevent printer from publishing works that did not meet the approval of the political and religious authorities(809). However, the philosophies feelings were taken like those of the people being persecuted, as just words from someone of higher authority to make a decision about. Thankfully, individual freedom has become a reality, and, although, political officials are given more regard, in word, individuals are given the freedom to express themselves. Lastly, the ideal of political and legal equality was shared by only those in power (aristocrats and other social elites); however, philosophies envisioned " a society in which all individuals would be equal before the law"(810). Jean-Jacques Rousseau was recognized as a prominent advocate of political equality which he expresses in his book, The Social Contract, " Rousseau argued that members of a society were collectively the sovereign. In an ideal society all individuals would participate directly in the formulation of policy and the creation of laws. In the absence of royalty, aristocrats and other priveleged elites, the general will of the people would carry the day (810)". The effects of this ideal were individuals were given the chance to explore the extent of their equality, not as evident then as it is now.
