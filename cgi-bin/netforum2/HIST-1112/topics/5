===more:Imperialism may be defined as the imposition of control over a group of people denying them the freedom to make their own decisions. What are the legacies of imperialism? How has world history revolved around issues stemming from imperialism, when lesser-developed countries are controlled by developed countries? How can imperialism be justified, given the ideals of freedom and popular sovereignty that we read about in Chapter 30?
