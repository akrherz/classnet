===more:Do you think people's lives today are better than people's lives were one hundred years ago? Why or why not? How has industrialization improved the lives of people? How has it negatively impacted them? Notice that industrialization first occurred in Great Britain, a strong country that had many colonies. Must nations be industrialized in order to be great? What's the connection between industrialization and imperialism?
