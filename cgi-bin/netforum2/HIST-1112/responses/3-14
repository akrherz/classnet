===message:I agree with the statement that conservatives and liberals have two different form of government. This is evident in the many contrasting ideas in our government today. Most people that make up our government or either liberals or conservatives.One of the main differences between the two idealogies are conservatives tend to be more political and liberals are more for the people in the society. In my opinion conservatism is not the best idea for our government. The ideology of conservatism have always centered around government "the powerful and the upper class." Again, as it stands today liberals are always more suspectible to change, fighting for the rights of the people and they made sure they were not over powered and out numbered by the conservatives. Even today, the theories still hold some truth in how each idea perceives an individual. If you are a conservative more than likely your views will be more centered toward political, governement related events. However if you are a liberal your views will be more centered toward helping people and individuals.  I believe that  it is good to have two different ideologies. The reason it is beneficial to have two different ideas is because one idea can  always check the other.  Similiarly, like a check and balance system. This would allow every one to be honest and act on behalf of their representative class rather it be conservatism or liberalism.
