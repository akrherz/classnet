===message:Tim, I do agree whole heartly with your comment when you say, ..."Fundamental ethics, morals, and values of the political leaders down to the basic citizens have been declining more each decade". I think that we see a declining society with a few people struggling with much effort trying to hold it together. I think we are on the verge of a societal colapse spiritually, morals, and governmentally. I am not of the group who thinks the economy will turn around quikly. I think we need to open our big US eyes fast (before somebody punches them out again)and come to some conclusions to make some drastic changes in the way we think and live before we suffer more havoc in the land! I think our government is spending to much time focusing on the wrong issues! We are quickly deteriorating at the home front.
