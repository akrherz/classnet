===message:Yvonne I agree with you 100% but I think you left one or two things out. The strong leaders are not the only ones that can and will start wars, the war on terrorism was caused by  fanatics. Or at least I believe they are fanatics, I am only seeing them from the U.S.A. side of the conflict. I believe you will always have those religious leaders who believe that there way is the only way and that there God demands that they wipe out anyone who doesn’t worship it.

===message:You are correct about my leaving out the terrorists who cause wars.  I guess I got caught up in how the political leaders of countries will create unnecessary tension in order to establish their control even at the expense of human sacrifices.  For this reason I feel war is inevitable.  
<p>
Terrorists do cause war, but I think their acts are retaliations against people who have tried to control their way of life in one fashion or another.  Their act of terrorism is sending a message to someone or to a group.  Although governments inform us about the acts of terrorism through the media, do we really understand the message that is being sent or is the information censored in order to mislead us to support the war effort imposed by our leaders.  Sometimes I feel we are called to support a war, but I never really know why.

===message:We never really know why we are called on to support war. I definately believe that information is censored. Maybe not to intentionally mislead us, but because they feel we are better off not knowing and maybe we are.There is much that we do not know and much that we never will.

===message:Yvonne, it is nice to know that I am not the only one thinks that terrorism is usually in response to something someone else does. I know terrorism is a really bad thing, usually perpetrated against innocent victims, but how else is a small or unindustrialized people supposed to defend them selves and there way of life.  
     

Stephanie, I agree that there is much we do not know and much we will never know but I disagree with that cencoreship is not intentionally to mislead us. I think that is what censorship is all about, to keep the truth from being known, flat out lie, or to shape the truth to something that fits governmental purposes.

===message:Would you really want to know the entire truth?  I think that somethings are better unsaid.  I know that their our people in our society that could not handle knowing some of the things that the Government is hiding.  I don't think there is enough duck tape and plastic for some people.  But for me I keep a stocked supply of canned goods and a gas mask by my bedside.....just kidding.

===message:I also agree that women reaped considerable benefits from the war. While their were still some casualities, women who took on the work force enabled many to see the capabilities of women.


     I agree with your comment that wars will be inevitable due to the conflicts of peoples interest. I feel that with increasing knowledge, technology, and confliciting views wars are going to be inevitable. Although, I also feel that most wars can be avoided. As long as countries do not let their pride and reasoning stand in the way of resolution.
