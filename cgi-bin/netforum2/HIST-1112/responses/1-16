===message:In reply to your question: "Was this nature's way of cleaning house or keeping the population to a minimum"?  I feel that nature always has a way of taking care of itself.  Whether it be its populations or its biomes.  We have such greater diseases other than SARS or the West Nile Virus, such as AIDS.  It just may not seem as big of a deal in this century because we do have more medical knowledge.  Had we had this disease centuries ago, we would have lost more victims to it than we do today.  It is also a disease that can be undetectable for years, not like the smallpox, measles, and other diseases listed on page 629.  So, yes, I feel like nature takes care of its own.  Just my opinion.
