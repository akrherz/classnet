===message:I certainly agree with your point "In my opinion, sadly, the desire for equality in America has deteriorated to each small subset (special interest?)...

I also think that the philosophes of those times (Voltaire, John Locke, Rousseau, were great thinkers and motivators on the matters of equality for all. These advocators helps et the stages for many declarations written on the rights of people. But like those of the past and fighters of the future, they fight the same "hindering devils" but in different clothing. Take for instance the issue of slavery, we have the best documented inspired source (The Declaration of Independence) on the rights and equalities of man, but yet in all, our attempts to abolish slavery to many years to materialize! But let's take it to the 1960's. Did we not have the same Declaration of Independence that stated that "all men are created equal"??? If we were to live and die by that document, meaning if we really believed it and lived it, then, there would not have been a need for the "Bill of Rights"??? We keep writing and rewriting, and amending, etc. etc. etc. 

In my thought, Locke's opinion of equality for all still has the biggest impact on any society with the longest lasting repercussions. Why? Because we as a society and as well as other societies struggle with greed, selfishness, pride, and lusts, making it difficult to see our brother or sister as equal. Coupled with the special interest groups, etc. equality for all is yet another battle.

===message:I, too, agree with your take on self-determination and equality.  The phrase "every man for himself" comes to mind.  The wealthy, the political, the religious, all subsets of mankind are out for themselves and the groups that they belong to.  They aren't out looking for a way to provide equality for everyone, just themselves.  It is sad when we say we are one, one human-race, that we really don't mean it.  I believe it does mean that the majority of people are out for that "one".  Equality for who?
