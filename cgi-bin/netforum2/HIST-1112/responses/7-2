===message:I, too, agree with you on your take of the photographs.  The uncertainty on that woman's face reads a thousand thoughts.  One can only imagine what was running through her mind, for herself and her young children.  Wouldn't you have liked to have seen their sad faces?  In the other photo, talk about conformity.  It's amazing what a photo can tell, I think it gives a more factual insight to reality than a painting.
