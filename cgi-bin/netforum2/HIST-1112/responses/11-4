===message:Maybe the US intruded Iran's traditional culture with the introduction of Barbie, but they were influenced by it. They invented their own version "Sara" which met their values so their children could play with her while American children played with Barbie. Was it in retaliation or interest? Who really knows?

===message:Ramon I know that other countries are wary of Americanization but I don’t think it is for good reason. If the people of another country did not like what American corporations are selling then they would not buy them. As an example I submit the Barbie doll sold in Japan. The Mattel Corporation had destroy or re-ship all the dolls that were not sold in Japan to another country and remake the doll in order to sell them in Japan. If the country that a corporation is trying to sell something in doesn’t like it, all they have to do is not buy from it. The power of the consumer.

===message:I agree completely.  If the French population prefers their tradition of lengthy lunches at relaxing cafes shouldn't they continue to do that rather than taking their business to a fast food restaurant?  If they don't create the demand then they may not have to worry about any more U.S. type fast food establishments appearing.
