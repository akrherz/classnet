===message:I think Shemika got it right on the button with her discussion. In their own ways, both the US and the Soviet Union were trying to improve the standards of living of many people. Unfortunately, capitalism and communism seemed to conterdict each other. Suddenly you had to be on one side or the other. Luckly their were many leaders on both sides that took steps to relieve tensions at the right times. Khrushchev fostered a peaceful coexistence policy with the US. As both sides reached MAD or mutally assured destruction through nuclear weapon proliferation,it became obvious that war would be a mistake, and leaders on both sides realized this. 

In a way, I guess communism offered freedom from governments that controlled and manipulated their leadership through class divisions. Communism put everybody on the same playing feild. But there was a lot of censorship and violent control on anti- communist ideas and movements. Captilism offered freedom from social class restrictions in another way. Instead of everybody being of the same social class like in communist controlled countries, anybody could rise to any level of status given that they could acheive it. I believe that the US was way more free than their Soviet counterparts, especially after the Civil Rights movement.

===message:Shemika  I agree that the goal of the communism was to improve the lives of the working people but I don’t think that is what it did. The five year plans did little to improve the lives of the working people it did more to advance the country than the people.

I like your comment, "Instead of everybody being of the same social class like in communist controlled countries, anybody could rise to any level of status given that they could acheive it". I see that point also. That I think is one of the distinct differentiators of Communism vs Capitalism!
