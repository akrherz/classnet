===message:Tim, you make several good points.  I had forgotten how much pressure had to be put on the Russian people to be superior in every way.  The arms race was not just a race for technology but, like you said, a race for everything from technology to personal purity and fitness. One of the Rocky movies capitalized on there quest for fitness superiority. With the propaganda that was put out by the Russian government I guess when Krushchev was talking about freedom it was not freedom from manipulation.

===message:I agree that Russia was viewed as a superior nation and wanted to continue that reputation. The history of Krushchev makes his intentions obvious. Although he wasn't well educated, the man had values and wanted the working class to be successful.

I agree with Stephanie too. It is not education all the time that move people to have a real need and a strong desire for hope, change, and commitment. Sometimes, and in many cases it is the people who come up from the grass roots who actually see and sense the real needs of the common peoples.

I have to agree with Stephanie on this too. It is not the educated all the time that has the "answers". Sometimes, and in many cases it is those that come from the grass roots that are able to sense and feel the pains of the common people and the need for change...since they share and experience many of the same sufferings.
