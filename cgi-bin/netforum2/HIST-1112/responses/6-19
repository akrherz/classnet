===message:I believe that any war is advoidable.Unfortuntely today people have been subjected to think that everything centers around war and war tactics. Let me expalin further. The Great War was not necessary because what did it accomplish? I can tell you what it did accomplish killings, murdering and slaughtering of innocent lives. There was a lot of expectations that soldiers were expecting when they returned from war, Power, Prestige, Better income, Better Pay. However they did not live to see any of the rewards promised to them in return for fighting in the Great War. In this particular chapter the content focused on the causes of the war. However I would like to say that there are always other  alternatives when one is considering war. I feel that this war marked the beginning and ending of innocent people's lives.
