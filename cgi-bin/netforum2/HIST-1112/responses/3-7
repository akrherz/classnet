===message:I disagree with your assesment.  The goal of our founding fathers was rule based on social stature.  Many of the revolutions read on in this chapter explains how all the revolution were basically caused by the majority population being upset with the minority population rule and control of the majority lives.  Due to wealth and status people were chosen to lead.  Right or Wrong that is not what we are here to answer.  Thier were many good men who where overwhelmed by the greed factor and silently let the powers to be take control.

===message:This is very thought provoking!  When you get right down to the basics, that the government should be by the people and for the people, it puts the liberal vs. conservative debate into perspective.  Government should only be as large and as controlling as absolutely necessary.

===message:I think that the Enligtenment era presented a fresher approach to government.  The philosophes did not have a problem with the monarchial rulers, but insisted that they be more concerned and in tune with the people they were supposed to be representing.  The argument of political and legal equality is a major issue and not just self-government.  The philosophes did not suggest that the ruling class be overthrown, but that there should be equity of power especially when the common people would be greatly effected.  Over and over again throughout chapter 30 we see how the underdog tries to gain political power.  Equality, liberty, and fraternity rang out more than anything else.  Of course, many political systems of that day only made concessions for the wealthy and powerful monarchy, but ultimately what really mattered was the lack of involvement the "people" were given.
