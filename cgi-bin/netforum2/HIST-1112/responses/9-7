===message:Anthony I agree that a communal society is what he believed and I can see were it has some merits. For those of us born poor in a capitalists society it seems that the rich, Dupont’s, Kennedy’s, Rothschild’s, and those with million’s in assets, have it made from the start. The problem with a communal society is that not everyone is going to work hard, there will always be those that will not work and just want someone to support them so in a communal society they get the same benefits as those that work hard.

I also agree with you about the politicians making war and not the people. I was stationed in Germany in 1981 when the U.S. decided to transport some of the I.C.B.M. Missiles out of Germany and across Belgium. The anxiety was more than just a little high, you could feel the hatred and fear form some of the people that lived there.

===message:David, I couldn't agree with you more that some people will strive and work hard for what they want while others will wait for handouts. It is all too common and a definate problem. To David and Anthony, thanks for your support in the armed forces. You are very brave men.

===message:I agree with your take on a communist's society and capitalist's society.  Communists did work for a common goal and there is an imbalance in the capitalist's world between the rich and poor.

Oh yea, thanks for serving when you did.  We should all be extremely thankful for those that do.  (Whether we agree with our government or not, there are people out there putting their lives on the line for us to be able to have freedom.)

===message:Yea David I bet it did. The armed forces are a great opportunity for anyone. I have a nephew in the marines and it has really taught him alot. He has become a respectable young man with values and goals along with great self esteem. The opportunities are endless for him thanks to the service. He is now stationed in Japan.

===message:You are absolutely on the mark that one of the fundamental problems with communism is that there is no incentive to do one's best.  I think that it serves as evidence that you can't take human beings and drop them into a mold that is completely controlled by an elite few and expect them to thrive.

===message:Your view is on the capitalist and communal society is interesting. Why do you think there were such an imbalance between the rich and poor in the capitalist society? What are your feelings about a capitalist society? Do you agree with the separate classes Rich/poor?
