===message:How interesting!  Until I read your comment that "People now had visual pictures to relate to as well as other opinions to validate their feelings of anxiety" I never thought of art or paintings as a means of communication or even as a way to relate to one another.  Perhaps this type of expression went a long way toward helping people understand that they weren’t alone and gave them more ability to cope with their circumstances. Great evaluation!

===message:I feel that you made a strong argument concerning the age of anxiety. I strongly agree with your comment about peoples "loss of hope" during this period. Due to the tremendous suffering and loss of many nations, I feel that Many civilians demanded control over the damaging results of the war. I agree that this is why the new forms of government (fascism , communism, and naionalism) flourished. Because in a desperate time of need people will support those who promise improvement and exercise a new type of control.
