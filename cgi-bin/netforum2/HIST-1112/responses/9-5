===message:Jordan, You did an outstanding job job on this discussion! What you said about the threat and fears really made since about the freedom being at risk.  As a matter of fact, just yesterday on one of the Local Access Channels they were discussing this very topic.  They polled citizens and asked them "Do you feel like you have more freedom today than before September 11, 2001?"  Majority of the people said that they don't feel like they have a lot of freedom,not because of the new security measures but because of the fear of more hosility/attacks towards the U.S. So just as you put it, and as I saw on T.V. yesterday fear does have a way of binding us and limiting our freedom
