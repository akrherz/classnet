===message:Yes. Many are jealous of our country because it is the land of opportunity. Many also do not like the US primarily due to the envy of having so much freedom, wealth, and prosperous resources. While this is true, many are fooled and taught from birth by a ruler like Saddam to hate America because we have so much power and control.  They tell their citizens that America is stealing their freedom away from them while it is their own leader who the one is depriving them of this. Saddam blinds the Islamic from seeing how America truly is.  Many have faith that Saddam is true and they follow them which results in conflict with America and the Islam world.

===message:I somewhat disagree that the Islamic world feels inferior to the U.S. It is obvious that the U.S. is a very powerful nation, but I don't believe that they feel that are a lesser country because of our superiority. The Muslim world obviously disagrees with the U.S. culture and political system. They have even resented the U.S. involvement in their country at times.  "The problems faced by Muslim societies lay, according to Islamists, in the revival of Islamic  identity, values, and power" (p.1121). While I do belive that the Islamic quest for freedom has been threatened by U.S. power (and other superpowers), I do not believe that the Islamic world is jealous and strives for U.S. equality. I feel that they believe that their divine cultural beliefs and values are what are going to lead their country to a seperate state of superiority.
