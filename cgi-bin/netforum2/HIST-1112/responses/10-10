===message:I agree with your statement that in general, our lifestyles and our culture do cause conflict.  I think that is because we do live in a free country and are allowed to be who we want to be; not who we have to be or who somebody else wants us to be.  We do have great opportunities.  I'm thankful to live here -- there's no place like home.

===message:I agree with you both.  I think that overall the U.S. government has done the right thing in the majority of it's affairs.  Our government is not perfect but it's probably unreasonable to think any government will ever be flawless.  I feel extremely fortunate to have been born in this country.  There is no place else I would rather be.

===message: Your commentary is very interesting. I had never thought of the middle east resentment steming from declining world trade. I do feel that the success of trade within the U.S. has contributed to troubles with the Islamic world, but I do not feel that it is the main source of our conflicts.
