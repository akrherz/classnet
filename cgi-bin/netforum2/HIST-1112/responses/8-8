===message:<p>I think that you misunderstood the question. It is asking why people would view it as the “good war.” The major thing that stuck out about WWII that was not in WWI was the cruel exploitation of ethnic groups. There was the anti-Semitism by the Germans and the devastation of the Chinese by the Japanese. This mistreatment is what stuck out most about WWII and it is easy to see why people believed that their countries were fighting the “good war” by fighting against these countries.</p>

===message:Mr. Paulson,  I agree with some of what you said but I truly don't think that WWII was based on imperialism.  When you think back to the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  I dont think they had any intentions of occupying the US.  I think the WWII was more based on expanding occupation and destroying civilizations that were different than they was.  Another item that I dont agree with is that the war was caused by the Great depression.  I truly feel that WWI taught many of the nations that War was an economic drain to a country and to say the the depression was a cause for it when many countries never came out of the depression is not accurate.

===message:I agree with Ramon also. Check out my comments at the bottom of my posting refering to the "good war". It was the thought that people were fighting against the forces and ideologies of Japan, Germany, Italy trying to put an end to the agression.

Also, your comment "One of the things that caused WW2 the “great depression”... I am not sure that your following sentences build a basis to support that claim. 

In my opinion I would beg to differ and would rather support the fact that the Great Depression was "not the cause of..." but rather it (the GDP) was caused by...In other words it happened!

===message:To Al, Stephanie, Leon,




You three could be right but I believe that one of the reasons Hitler came to power was because he promised to get the German people out of the depression. He created jobs by  confiscating the wealth of the Jews and then forcing them out of the country so that the German people could have the jobs that the Jews used to have. He used the wealth that he confiscated from them to finance the government and the national army he was creating. After he ran out of places to send the Jews he decided on the “final solution”. That is why I think the Great Depression was the cause of WW2.



Thanks for letting me know what you think.
