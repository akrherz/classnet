===message:I really enjoyed chatting with you guys too. This is the first online class that I have gotten such nice and positive farewells. It's really nice, almost like the class has bonded even though we never met. It is my nephew that is in Japan and he is loving it. Good luck in algebra. What class is it? I am pretty good in math, but don't have alot of time. I will help you out if I can, just e-mail me (csu14933).They also have great help in learning support or student services. Best of luck!
