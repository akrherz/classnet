===message:<p>I agree with your view that Khrushchev’s definition of free involved the equality of the entire population in society. However, I believe that his definition of freedom was deeper than just social equality. Khrushchev wanted the communist society to represent all forms of freedom such as cultural, intellectual and scientific freedom. He was especially critical of the American society that was involved in various forms of espionage and subversion.  Although he had a positive vision for the world, Khrushchev’s vision failed because of the mere existence of the Berlin Wall.</p>
