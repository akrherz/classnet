===message: The Eurpeans in my opinion benefited most from the Columbian Exhange. The reason I agree with this perspective of thinking is because Eurpeans benefited from the food, animals, crops. Wheat, vines, horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and chickens went from Europe to Americas in turn they sharply increased supplies of food and  animal energy. This benefit stongly increased Eurpeans power, argiculture, finances, way of living, way of producing, and prosperity. There was no other group of people that were handed all the luxeries in life to succeed and prosper.  The Columbian Exchange was not very diverse or considerate to say the least in the distribution of their resources. How is it fair? There were other people that could have benefited from the resources of the Columbian Exchange but was not giving the opportunity that the Eurpeans had. However,I agree also that History does repeat itself in a lot of different ways. One way I have  found to be true is the economy, way of life, and cost of life.
