===message:David I think that Yvonne clearly stated what the definition of free was in the first paragraph........ Nikita Khrushchev’s definition of free was the improvement in the lives of working people. He felt capitalism didn’t solve the problems that the common man faced, and he felt his society was open to honest trade, to scientific, technical and cultural exchange, to the exchanging of truthful information.(1080)

===message:I think his definition was the improvement of the lives of the working class.  Khrushchev was not impressed with America's capitalism.  He was more concerned with the social issues for the people in his country.  For instance, Khrushchev pointed out that some americans were homeless because they were unable to pay for adequate housing.  During that time, housing was provided to the people in the Soviet Union.
