===message:Diane, you are probably right that Khrushchev’s definition of freedom is making sure that everyone has the security blanket of knowing that they are going to get a share of the whole pie. I also think that is there downfall because it also means you only get a share of what you do so why should you do more? Doesn’t seem to me to be a way to promote advancement for the individual or the country.

===message:You are right in some aspects about "what they don't know wont hurt them,"  But sometimes it does hurt them.  Could you imagen living in a communist country when the possiblity of improving you life style is available in a capitalist society.  Being able to break free to secure a better quality of living????  Ill take the rich and poor in capitalist society over a communist society any day.

===message:<p>Hey Diane, I like your interpretation of Khrushchev’s idea of being free.  It is true that the communistic system brings everyone in society together as the same economic level and social status.  In this regard, who could tell their neighbor, that they were unequally wealthier or living at a higher standard of living?  This portrait of the entire nation working for their cut in food and wages was the system that Khrushchev and his communistic supporters believed was freedom.  Compared to the prosperous United States, with the varying levels of wealth and status of the people, Khrushchev probably saw the differences in the U.S. society as unequal and unfair.</p>
   <p>This is why Khrushchev probably said that all peoples will open up to a world of communism and turn their backs on the “free world” of capitalism.  Since there were nations that were suffering, he predicted that the people would reach out to a relatively free national state, which supported and provided for the basic needs of society.  The problem with this type of society though, was that it prohibited personal growth and inhibits motives to produce more quantities of products and higher quality.  The absence of motivation of the people and the strain the government had to provide for the people; ultimately led to the diminished economic state of the Soviet Union and its collapse.  Early on though, Khrushchev was anti-American and anti-capitalism and went to great lengths to keep his “free” society.</p>

===message:I sorta Disagree with you and only because he spent a lot of effort in erasing the days of Stalin.  He truly wanted the USSR to operate on a democratic style nation but because of the economy and various war problems it was almost impossible.  The arms race and space race really drained the USSR of the possibility of competing so as a result it was the worst of 2 evils.  I do agree with your final assesment of the USSR and USA and how they controlled the countries by making the nations live in fear of each other for so long.  I truly believe that they both new that they would not push the button because thier would be no winner in a nuclear war.

===message:Diane,

You are correct that it was a power struggle between the US and the Soviets. As you stated there was much clashing going on between the ideologies, governments, societies, etc. 

But your statement,..."Why would they want to take a risk on the capitalist's society by going out and having to take a chance on earning their own stability when they could have a little bit guarenteed to them? What they didn't know did hurt them." I would hope that you realize that nothing is "gauranteed"...correct? 

But my real issue is this: I think the words "risk" and chance are very important, meaningful words! I would rather have a "chance" to choose versus NO chance! Whether it be Communism or Capitalism...give me the chance and let me take the risk!

===message:As you'll notice I stated "what they didn't know did hurt them."  I think I was merely coming from their perspective -not mine.  I do believe that is how they felt or else they would have ventured out.  You're right, nothing in life is a guarantee, and sometimes you don't learn that until it's too late.
