===message:I agree with you David that Imperialism led to freedom of nations.  Even though the local peoples of these lands were oppressed and many killed through desease and war, most of the lands have gained freedom from the time they were controlled.  One great aspect of Imperialism is that the local people were exposed to the other cultures of the world and foreign education.  The French and English motivated this education in their colonies by biulding schools for the locals.  Eventually, all of the enlightment values, freedom, and popular sovereignty triggered these oppressed people groups to revolt and take back their countries.  An example of this is given in our text, when in 1909 colonial authorities granted some wealthy Indian people to have local legislative councils.  This allowed the Indian people to get their political reforms and movements underway.  In 1947 the nation of India was identified as indepentdent of colonial rule.  So it is true that lands were brought forward as free nations, even if they had to go through a time of oppression and colonial rule.

===message:Your assesment sounds like self imposed slavery!  I dont feel that countries had to sell out the population to advance in the industrial environment.  Then only to be overthrown by the stronger bully.  Many facets of your analysis resulted in devastation and grief.  Though what is done is done I do feel that it could have been accomplished in a more humane way.

===message:Al I didn’t say it was the best or most humane way but I think it is the quickest and the most human way. As an example I give you some of the tribes in Africa that still see a lighter as magic, the plane as a magic flying bird and still think there is nothing but void outside the forest. You can also look at some of the native Australian people who even in the 21st century prefer to live by the spear and boomerang.
