===message:I feel like all parties involved benefited from each other.Mt reason for saying this is because, the Ameicans were independent peoples.Americans were adapted to their environment but vulnerable to the environment that Europeans possed.Having had no exposure to the Europeans,they lack immunity to their diseases,such as smallpox,measles,and diptheria.The Native strengthend themselves by taking some of the Europeans ways.Natives made effective use on the domestic animals.The natives also benefited and became dependant on European fur trade.If the Natives did not give aid to the Europeans,the Europeans would not have survived the New World. The native vegetables, such as potatoes and maize became staples to the Americans diet.One could also say that theEuropeans benefited the most because Europeans were in every part of the world.This made the population growth and the consequent increase to aggregate wealth.

===message:I personally feel that the Europeans benefited the most from the Columbian Exchange. I acknowledge the fact that certain domestic animals and crops, as well as general items such as ‘glass beads’ were received by the Africans and Americans. But I think that in the Americans case the only thing received from the Columbian Exchange that could prove to be somewhat useful was the immunity gained by exposure to the various diseases presented. The crops introduced were not essential because the Americans had been living for quite some time with a seemingly workable diet. If they had no domesticated animals such as the cow they were still able to get by just fine with what was at their disposal. As far as I can tell the most important gift given by the Americans was the land, seeing as that not too many people were left alive from the initial contact. It allowed for expansion of generations to come. 
In the instance of the Africans I also feel the Europeans benefited the most. Crops were introduced that allowed for more variety in their diet on both sides. From the book it seems that it was more of a material exchange for the Africans than an agricultural exchange. With the Asians it seemed that they gave more than they actually received. I saw them as well established with a lot to offer and not too much to gain except knowledge. They had, for quite a while, the better diet, better living standards and advanced technology.

===message:Hey. The Europeans definitely benefitted most through the Columbian Exchange. They had all the advantages, and eventually they took the land away from the natives. In this land that use to be the home of red people, now has everybody but red people. Native Americans are the smallest minority in their own land. You hear about all this oppression upon other people's but you don't hear that much from the native Americans because they' re culture has been destroyed. It is easy to see that all Native Americans have now are casinos that entertain the greed of their invaders. In hindsight, they really gained nothing material for losing everthing that they had.

===message:I never would have thought the land Ayana, but that is a good point.  Eventhough, it was more a take-over than an exchange.  I do agree with the Asians because they already had most things the Europeans had at that point. Does anyone know how Asians were affected by the diseaes from the Europeans?
