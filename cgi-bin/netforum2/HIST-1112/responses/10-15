===message:I truly understand what you say but, I disagree.  Just because they chose to base their government on religion does not give them the right to retaliate againts the United States.  Clearly the 9-11 incident was based on their religion and their way of saying, we want to make you (US) follow our way.  No way, no how did we ever, according to History, did the US try to impose religion on these countries, or democracy, if anything, they helped them become what they wanted to be.  They are the ones that do not accept who we are, and therefore, the feel threatened by our influence, so they crash airplanes and kill thousands of civilians.
Their ways are fine as long as they stay over there and do not kill our people!

===message:The 911 incident had nothing to do with the Islamic world. It was a select group of extremists. Your connecting of that incident or that way of thinking to the Islamic world in general is like saying that all Christians are fanatical nutters who will go around killing anyone who decides they want to have an abortion. And their reaction to feeling threatened by influence is no different than our reaction during the Cold War, and the threat wasn't even on our own soil. We really need to try to look at both sides of the story, or both points of view.

===message:I disagree with your view. I don't believe that the United States is about power. However when religion is involved as you stated that the Islamic nation is about religion and the Us is about power. I feel the United States have every right to exert authority and power. I believe that it is not the contributing factor to the differences and problems they have between each other. When religion and power come together and there is a difference in opinion/ beliefs views can get very heated and very confrontational. I am very happy that the United States have  fought for us. Religious nations such as the Islamic nations should have their own views but we (US) people should have a right to have a choice about religion also.
