===message:You ask some very good questions. What about the others? As far as the Native Americans, you are absolutely right. They did not benefit from the Columbian Exchange. If peolpe from another nation came to our country today, they would not get very far in trying to take it over. The USA has become a very strong nation and it all began when the "new" world was dicovered and people took an interest in it's success and development. We can consider that a gift to us and one I am very thankful for.

===message:I totally agree with your assesment.  It bothers me though that in the name of progress some of the people who replied to you feel that progress was more important than survival..  Whole civilizations were truly wiped out or misplaced by the Columbian Exchange.  But they say progress was worth it.  I really feel that progress can still be made without polorizing an entire race.  So I guess I totally agree with Rosenburg that we did bring a lot from the OLD WORLD  into the NEW!

===message:Considering that I was the only reply to Ramon, I suppose I was the one who bothered you. I did not say that progress was more important than survival. I find it very unfortunate that many civilizations were negatively affected in order for others to succeed. I do agree with you that progress should still be possible without polarizing an entire race, but who's to say what could have been back then? Niether of us were there.

===message:Ramon,
I totally agree with you on many of the facts that you presented, but I have to disagree with on a major one.  Of course the Europeans heavily benefited from the Columbian exchange.  They seemingly would possess all the riches and wealth the exchange brought.  But if we were to examine the position of the Europeans that would make the Americas their new land, it would be easy to see that the "new" Americans would benefit greatly.  They did not have to contend with masses of Native Americans because disease had already visited the Americas before they even arrived.  These "new" Americans took what they learned from the natives and secured a viable commodity in food crops.  The Europeans laid the ground work for these "Americans" to establish a congruent society that could flourish.
