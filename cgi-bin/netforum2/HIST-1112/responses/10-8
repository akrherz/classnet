I echo what you are saying..."Through all of this the United States intervened for one reason and for one reason only and that was to protect its interest." 

I remember quite a bit also being the age that I am regarding US politics in the past. What people don't realize is that a capitalistic nation is "all about capitalism" with the "appearance" of helping others! 

And I am saying this loud and clear, If there is no interest for the US, you better believe that we (US) won't put a foot forward!
