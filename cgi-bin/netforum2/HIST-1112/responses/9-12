===message:This is very interesting!  I am curious about why you ascribe discriminatory characteristics to capitalism rather than to individuals.  Do you feel that capitalist societies force citizens to have negative feelings toward minorities?  Do you think it’s possible that people might be offended by communists living in our country for personal reasons and not due to any government interference?  I guess it’s impossible to truly measure how much our government influences the masses, but hopefully the trend toward greater equality is an indication that people are somewhat capable of individual thought.

===message:I did not say that individuals are incapable of individual thought. I said that governments are guilty of policing thought. This is true of both capitalist democracies and communist totalitarian regimes. The persecution of communists because of their ideology is no more permissible than the persecution of persons because of their religion, gender, sexual orientation, or race. Therefore, whether people are “offended by communists living in our country for personal reasons” or not, the civil liberties of communists should not be infringed.

===message:You both have valid arguments about freedom. Let's us not shift views about the topic at hand. Freedom. It is true that freedom was not for all and certain groups were discriminated against. this is history and it can not be changed. However hopefully things have changed today in 2003 but we are talking about a different era in our history. Ordinarily an individual would be labeled as having his/hers own discriminatory perception of people and different government. I believe the intentions were focusing on the past and the past events that have encountered. I do believe that discrimination of people based on their class, religion and color was very evident during the war times. the statement should not be taken out of texture just pertinent information that helps understand the mood and the relations of the government during the war times.

===message:I have to agree with Ms. Walker in that history is just that history- the past. We have to learn from the past to make a better future for those of us living and those who will follow us. I also agree with Ms. Johnson, "neither capitalist nor communist were truly free". Each individual had their own opinions, yes, however what mattered was how the government was run and who by. Thankfully, the cold war is over and communism has little effect on the world but will anyone ever be truly free?
