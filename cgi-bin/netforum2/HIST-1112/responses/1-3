===message:I think the European benefited most of all from the colombian exchange. I think what Mr. Weatherford means by saying Indian giver is that the Europeans made promises to the Indians that they didn't keep and then almost wiped them out with diseases that they didn't have any immunity to. The most important gifts to the Americas were food crops that normally didn't grow in the regions of the Americas like maize and potatos. The most important gift given to the Native Americans was death. They were almost wiped out and to this day there is less than 5% of Native Americans living. On the day of Thanksgiving the Native Americans congregate at Plymouth rock and morn their loss to the New Americans.

===message:I agree that was a great tradegy of that time.  However, I think there were benefits and  tradegies for all involved.  When I look back, I still feel that the America's benefited greatly, but with anything it always comes with a price.  Unfournately, the Native Americans paid the higher price.

===message:I agree that the Europeans benefited enormously from the exchange, as american foods spread across the Old World and greatly enriched the food supply. This was likely responsible for the subsequent population growth around the world.  Americans did not benefit much in the exchange.  Although Americans were introduced to some plants and animals, the beneifit was minimal compared to the high death rate they suffered from diseases brought from the Old World. The most harm came from European and African diseases that found their way to the New World and drastically reduced the native populations because they were not immuned to them.  Although Native Americans probably gave syphilis to the Old World and perhaps Tuberculosis and other diseases, Native Americans suffered much more than Europeans from the exchanges of deadly diseases.

===message:I agree Connie. There is always a price to pay for every gain. It is unfortuanate that the Native Americans paid the higher price in this case, but I am thankful that things worked out as they did. If it weren't for this sacrifice, where would we be today?

===message:What about the devestation that was a result of the American great prosperity.  You make no mention that the areas that were low in population was partly to blame of the Europeans who population doubled because of thier ways.

===message:I firmly believe that devastion was felt by all, but in different ways.  As I look at the overall picture and how the exchange ultimately increased population because of the spread of food crops and animials, I still feel that benefits were felt by all, as well.

I do agree that it's a tradegy that some paid the ultimate price.
