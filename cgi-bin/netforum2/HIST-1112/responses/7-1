===subject:Age of Anxiety
===from:Anthony Shealey
===date:Fri Jul  4  9:02:45 2003
===message:Many of the artist during the times of the great depression began to think outside the box of what was considered normal to society. The painting on page 1002 is an example of this distortion of reality, bending the shape of normality. The picture on 1008 of the tahitian women is a picture that captures the bueaty that once was before the tides of change. The colors brings the picture to life and immortalized the past. On 1014 the photograph of the woman and children captures the despair and hunger during those times. Also the colors of the photo in black and white captures the gloominess of society during the great depression which caused much anxiety. The sources of anxiety were caused by economic instabiliy, food shortage, labor shortage, and the goverment not being responsible for their people. Communism thrive during those times because of the resentment of the rich controlling the poor.Facism thrived because of pride for their culture, their way of life in respect for their country. Nationalism thrived because of the goverments in the countries that practice it wanting to keep foreign intervention in their societies out. Their country is for their people.

===message:You have taken an art class. I can tell. You make very good points. Art at this time was a very powerful expression. It gave understanding for those who understood the art. They could see the paintings and photos and see that they are not alone. There are other people in the world that are going through the same difficulty. Good job on describing what the art was trying to express. It gives the rest of the class a better idea on what people were thinking at this time.

===from:Yvonne Turner

===message:The artist's definitely used their art to express the freedom and inner feelings.  I think it showed the carefree world during this time.  Alot of things arose during the Age of Anxiety, and the world was open to new ideas even if it meant a little controversy.

===message:Yeah. I agree with you too. I relate the art of that time like a coin with two sides. One representing the freedoms people had fought for, and the other side of the coin a reflection of those who paid a price that they had not asked for!
