===message:I would like to say that I agree with Stephanie on most of her assessment of the last 100 years. I do think that what she says is true for the majority of the people but there are a few exceptions to the rule, there are always exceptions to a rule. Stephanie mentioned the Amish people saying she would not want to live like them and I agree with her but only because I think that they take there lack of technology to the extreme. My wife and I both grew up around Amish communities and there is a lot to be said for there way of life. Now I am not taking offense to Stephanie in any way, obviously I am not Amish, but I would like to point out some trait’s the Amish have. You don’t hear about them having a welfare problem, drug problem, domestic violence problem or criminal records. I have never met anyone who has known a lazy Amish man or woman, every Amish I have known works harder than any other person I know. There is a lot to be said for there culture and way of life they have been living for the last 150 years.

===message:Thanks for your response and I am terribly sorry if I offended you in any way. I was just using the Amish as an example. I would have to say that you made some very good points about them. Although I would not want their lifestyle, they seem like very good people.
