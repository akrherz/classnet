===message:Imperalist is the ability for countries like Soviet Union,U.S.,Britian and others to dominate not just there immediate neighbors but regions on the other side of their globe that makes them unique.Imperalism effects vary in different countries.The undeveloped countries means that their exports are permantely underpriced.Imports are overpriced and they have no control over access to international markets.Imperalism means dept to imperalist countries,in return for outdated technology and military equiptment.Imperalist powers are not part of the solution,they are the problems.

===message:You make a valid argument against racism, but I don't think that you can fault imperialism for racism.  Throughout the world's explorations, indigenous peoples were always casualities of war.  They were never really taken as viable and civilized people.  And yes, for certain groups(like the Afrikaners) racism was a way of justifying the imposition of imperialism.  I think in a broader since industrialization of these "foreign" lands was a greater legacy left behind by imperialism.
