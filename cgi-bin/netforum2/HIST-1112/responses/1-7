===message:Not to refute what you are saying, but are you saying the native Americans or the Europeans benefited most?  Keep in mind that the Europeans basically took over the Americas after the 1500's.

===message:I believe that there were many countries to benefit from the Columbian Exchange.  As it states on page 630, all of the countries involved were affected by the outbreak of imported diseases.  It states:  "...disease epidemics sparked by the Columbian Exchange probably caused the worst demographic calamity in all of world history" (630).  The survivors and the generations to follow all benefitted in one way or another.  The global spread of the food crops and animals surpasses all of the grief caused by the diseases.  With the crops, people were provided with a nutritious and healthier diet.  With the livestock and other trading products each country could trade and bargain for what they needed.  They all benefit.

===message:Stephanie,
I agree with your defense of the Columbian exchange argument.  I also thought that the Americans benefited the most from the exchange.  Even though it may have been the Europeans that gained from the experience, the Americans had took on a more advantageous role.  They were able to settle on land that possessed essential food crops that were missing out of their diets in Europe.  And I also agree with Diane, overall everyone suffered but there were also great rewards in the forms of new plant-life, food crops, animals,and unfortunately disease.
