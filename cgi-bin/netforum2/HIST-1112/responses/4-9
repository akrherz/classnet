===message:I believe that people lives are much easier today. The reason I say this is because of the new technology and the means of producing a living. We can communicate with computers easily. In communicating with each other we can accomplish more tasks and get a lot more done. For example. We can pay bills, make reservation, talk to each other all via email. Industralization has improved the lives of the people because of new technology. We have computers, telephones, stoves, microwaves, and the list goes on and on. I believe new technology is the key to a successful and prominent culture. If we as a society continue to be open to change and embrace the new technology inturn this will make our nation more advance and more powerful than any other nations.  
 I feel that nations has to be industralized to be great. I feel that this statement is partly true. The reason I say this is because people who are living in a society makes a nation great. However, a nation must remain competetive and keep up with today's changing and demanding economy. The more advance a country is the more powerful it is.  I believe that industralization relies heavy on imperalism. The reason I say this is because without imperalism other countries would not be able to extend their influence through foreign trade. Industralization would almost be non existence if it was not for imperalism. Imperalism is an important factor and is greatly used with other countries. This is very important in selling other commodities to other countries.
