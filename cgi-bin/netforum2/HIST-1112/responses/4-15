===message:Hmmm...Not sure if I agree with yor last statement. "The only connection I see between Imperialism and industrialization is that the Imperialist nations were late in the Industrialization race" But that's OK. My take, I guess would be the opposite. I think Imperialism led the way to Industrialism. If you think about the aggressiveness of the imperial nations such as Japan, Britain, US, those countries had a great influence on other "imperialized" countries introducing them to all sorts of inventions, new ideas, ways of government, education, etc. I believe the imperialist countries helped to bring the "imperialized" countries "up to the present" sort of speak. Just a thought!
