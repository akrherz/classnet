===message:I agree with you partially.  I think that the programs that were put together during this era only benefited the rise of facism.  It was desighned to only accomodate those that were a part of the dictators race.  This been so they would gladly go along with the dictator.  This was added to when persecution and death became the law of the land.  It gave them a sense of pride of being a part of the race.  I dont disagree with your assesment but I do feel it went a littel deeper than what you stated.
