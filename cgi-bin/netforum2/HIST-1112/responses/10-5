===message:Heather, any ideas why Islam is so paranoid against any not nation not Islam? Why is it some Islam’s say that the teachings of Islam say to destroy the infidels and some Islam’s say it doesn’t? I am just curious, I don’t anything about Islam except the propaganda I hear on TV.

===message:No they do not feel that if you are not Islamic you are a threat.  But they do feel that the US intervention in thier country is as bad as a robber comming into your home and robbing you of your possessions.  Go Figure!

===message:I do also agree with Al on this one, Heather. In the wake of 9/11, I spent some adequate time talking with a Muslim in which he knew that I was a Christian (because I openly made it known). He never once anticipated an uneasiness nor did he express any objections, but openly acknowledged and respected my position. But I must say that he did openly and vocally expressed his dismay and anger regarding the US decision to bomb Iraq. He too was also an American by birth but had been brought up in a Muslim family (parents were Muslims) and traditions. He too didn't feel inferior (to say the least) but rather felt discriminated against, and imtimitdated by his so called "brethren" Americans. Both of us at the time were flying to California, which is where he resided. He often told me of reports whereby Muslim neighborhoods were singled out in California searching or terrorists. It became hysterical! Unfortunately, it's not until relax our minds from the hype and propaganda of the slanted politics, journalists, news reports, and all the "hysterical noises", etc., etc., etc., that we might be able to hear and see clearly what the real deal is.

Wouldn't you say this is true of what other countries think of the United States???????
