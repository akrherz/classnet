===message:Heather, I don’t know if I agree with the statement that “the threat of nuclear war outweighs any fears of being taken over by capitalism or communism“.  I think some things are worth dieing for and as an example of that on a world scale I give the Bay of Pigs. The Kennedy’s sure thought Nuclear War was better than having Communism threaten us so close to home.

===message:No I dont think it was the chosen world of communism.  But I do belivee that he meant freedom to chose communism.  In his deprogram of the Stalin era he tried to convince the people that through hard work and whatever that they could achive the economic freedom that they deserved.  Enjoyed your descussion and hope you do well in the class.

===message:I also agree with you. I do not believe you can be truly free under any form of government. I suppose that those of us that live under a 'free world' of capitalism are free of the domination of communism.
