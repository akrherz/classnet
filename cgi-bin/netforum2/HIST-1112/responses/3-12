===message:I agree with you that the revolutionary ideas of the rights of slaves and women intimidated many. I do not agree that we have a system that constitutes equal rights for all. If we look at it from a world aspect, there are many places where people or color and women are successful and enjoy equality to the fullest. However, this mostly occurs in countries where they are the dominant race or gender. I like to take a look at equality in terms of a country’s leaders. There has never been a “minority” or female president in the USA. In an equal society there should be an equal opportunity for a person of any gender or race to become the leader of that society. Intimidation is an interesting word you used regarding the equality of slaves and women. Slaves were first proclaimed free in the USA so that the Union could win the Confederate War. It was not out of a realization that “all men are created equal,” but because the Union was intimidated by the possibility of England and France joining the war against them. Even though the law constitutes equal rights for all today, equality is still a constant battle in this society.

===message:Very well said, Diane. It is very unfortunate that we have so many well expressed written documents on the rights of others, freedoms, etc. But all in all, people still had to loose their lives (and some still do) to fight for what's written and rightfully theirs, only upheld and lived by the few. Unfortunately, what's on paper is not in the hearts of many. How unfortunate...but fortunate that we still have the "right" to stand up for what we believe in, unlike many other countries. How ironic!

===message:Change for anyone most of the time is always hard. It is very easy to continue to accept the things we know as oppose to the things we don't know. This brings me to the new form of government. The abolition of slavery,and women's rights were two major changes that took effect under the new government.  I agree with the idea that the government took to long to acknowledge these individual rights. But let us not forget that this was a time that women were perceived  not to be equal and less than nothing and slaves were treated even worse than women. Can you imagine? It seems as if the change in this sitution was good and that it was for the best. I do feel that the Slavery and Women's Rights had the longer repercussions. Think about it. Women can vote, Women can have a career, Women can have an education etc. in addition slavery were abolished, everyone was treated equally, rights were given equally  and enforced to everyone. This was a good change and idea that has given structure to our new form of government. To be free and to be treated equally is all we hope for in this country.
