===message:I agree with you about "The Columbian Exchange is best defined as the global diffusion of plants, food crops, animals, human population, and disease pathogens."  I think that alot of people believe that the New World benefited the most, but the Old World benifited from the new food crops, the expansion of population growth and the overall economic benifits.  You do make a very strong point for both sides.
