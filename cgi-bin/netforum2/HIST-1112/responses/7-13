===message:Confusing time is right...to say the least! It was perfect soil for the people with "itching ears" to follow along a path that would "appear" to be a place of refuge at the time. It is those types of leaders that we must watch out for who take advantage of the weak at heart to monopolize on their own agendas that would cause a disruption to human values. There were many bandwagons to jump on, but some came at the lowering of moral standards and the precious cost of human life! Although Lenin brought a rapid industrialization to Russia, how do we justify the lives that were wasted under his plan. We can't!
