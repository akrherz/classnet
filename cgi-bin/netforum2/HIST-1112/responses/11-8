===message:I agree that we do not need to force our government on inferior countries. This would result only war. We do need to better our country so that others will see that we do have a really good government. As a leading country in the world we need to make our government better so that others will choose capitalism.

===message:I agree that as an American, we shouldn't force our way of life on other countries.  Is America really the place of dreams?  I don't think so.  I think there could be things we can learn from other countries, but we spend to much time trying to export our ideaology on others. There are somethings that Americans are doing that I don't want my child to even think about.  I think there is a high price to pay for capitalism.

===message:Yvonne, I 100% agree with you that America is not the place most dreams are made. I think it is the best government around. I also agree that we could learn things from other country’s. America is far from perfect and Capitalism keeps individuals down as well as raises them up. I think it is best shot at getting ahead that there is in the world at this point. Good luck on the final and I hope to have another discussion with you in other class

===message:I agree, corporations are out to make money and that is all.  They really don't care who are what you are, as long as you have the money to spend.  On that note, I find it ironic that as tensions continue to mount between the United States and the muslim nations Coca-Cola is in the process of introducing a coke "with ingredients that cater to the strict diet of muslims". It's all about the money!

===message:You all make very interesting points!  I completely agree that one person's definition of greed is another person's idea of security.  I also agree that we all have something to gain by being accepting of various cultures and taking advantage of the opportunities for enrichment that they provide.  One thing I find myself considering is whether or not the societies/people that are adopting some parts of American culture are in fact helpless victims of American models of efficient standardization.  Some are of course, as not all peoples have the means to prevent such changes.  But many cultures are able to make personal choices so perhaps we are not giving them the credit they deserve when we assign them the label of overpowered victim.
