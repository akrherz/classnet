===message:Ok, I am like TOTALLY in agreement with you. I could go on and on about how I feel not all change is change that is needed by all people but you hit right on the head. And your use of Star Trek <which was genius by the way> made me realize I am not the only person to use that show to explain life. I sooo like your way of thinking. Rock On

I was about to shut my computer down for the night and read your comments. (If you read this), that was a great assessment! Some great stuff. I like the correlation and imagery. It had me acting out in my mind what was actually taking place. I think you hit the nail RIGHT on the head. Made me probe my thoughts! Thanks!
