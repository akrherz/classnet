===message:I agree with Ms.Burns belief about women and children in the workplace and the changed conditions through industrailization. Women and childrens lives have changed for the better from industrialization. It gave women the oppotunity to take care of affairs in the home while having the option of an alternative way to support the family. It also allowed children to benifit from education and acquire skills needed for a promising future. 

I also believe that people today are living a more improved quality of life than they were 100 years ago. The public now benefits from higher standard of working conditions, wages, and economic benefits. People today have almost unlimited access to the luxuries of goods from all over the world, due in part to industrialization.
