===message:Al I think American’s do believe in two things. One is free will and the other is free enterprise. I don’t know if that is good or bad and I think a lot of wither it is good or bad depends on your point of view. From my personal point of view I think it is good but I am wrong more than I am right. I was also over in Germany during the  Reagan era and I enjoyed in immensely. I have several pictures I took when I took 5 days leave and traveled down the Rine river.

===message:Now is that a belief of is that a way to get ahead.  Free will is also questionable because many feel the free will is controlled.  Just recently we have had ground breaking decisions in the Supreme Court that has tested free will and look how those who opose the decision are barking at the moon.  So really think about that free will part.  Free enterprise I partly agree cause its not to free.  Millions have practiced thier Free enterprises and now are in the poor house so again I say we don't culturely believe in nothing of substance.  We celebrate a lot of things because of tradition but what as a nation can we say we truly believe in?

===message:Al,

In case you are still checking, I just noticed your title "World without Culture". Yeah, I can side with that a lil too! I mention this to my wife alot about Georgia (Atlanta). Being that we move from New Orleans (which is where we are from) with lots of culture, French, Spanish, German, and Itlaian, African influences (since slavery), we miss those "cultural" experiences! It is difficult for me to see the world as one shade (gray)!
