===message:Ms. Mercer your assestment is right on.  I would like to add that this war was the first war were totally distruction came by plane.  The invention of the Atomic bombed cast the world in a light that has never ever been matched.  I think that the use of the A-Bomb is the only thing that has kept us from another nuclear attack. Though it was used by our own nation I think we scared the hell out of ourselves.   Good JOb

===message:I agree with both Diane and Al. The use of the Atomic bomb in WWII has scared all nations to a point of self-evaluation. Most countries have the capabilities of using nuclear weapons but understand the catastrophic consequences of actually using them. The atomic bomb has killed hundreds of thousands of people but a nuclear weapon will destroy mankind as we know it. Some people may view WWII as the war to end all wars. We (U.S.) have had military conflicts since WWII but never to the extent of using nuclear power. Hopefully, WWII will be the last war with such large casualties.

===message:You make an interesting point in saying that many are alive today that live with the memories of the horrors and fear of WWII.  At a time when we are losing so many of our American men and women that lived during WWII we have been able to feel a sample of what some of them experienced due to September 11th.  For those that can remember the attack on Pearl Harbor the news that day may have brought back a flood of memories.  No amount of study can replicate the experience they have had with the economic, social, political, and psychological changes they have experienced as a result of that war.

===message:Agreed! I had the opportunity many years ago in a post office in New Orleans (where I am from) to have met a veteran of WW II who happened to be a part of the armed forces stationed at Pearl Harbor. I had the heebee jeebeeies as we conversed. He said it was the most devasting time and the scariest in his life. It happened so fast and sudden! Although he was a survivor, you could see the excitement in his face as he reminisced that event.
