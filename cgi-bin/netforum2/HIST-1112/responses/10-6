===message:You know Jordan I whole heartedly agree with you but I am starting to understand some of the problems between the U.S. and Islam now. I don’t know if I could just stand there and watch a women be beat or killed because she showed her face in public. One of the fundamentals of my upbringing is that you don’t hit your spouse, male of female, for any reason. You also don’t stand by and allow someone to be hurt or killed because you are scared or just don’t want to get involved. You just don’t do those things regardless of the consequences.

===message:I agree with you David that beating women in public is not justified and should be protested against.  But if you were living in an Islamic nation where it was illegal for a women to reveal herself (this does not mean that they do not go in town to purchase items, only uncovering themselves from their robes and revealing their face is a crime), I seriously doubt you would protest or do something against this act.  This is just how society works in some of these Arab nations.  Now in America it is a totally different senerio, and in which I totally support.  I believe that every persons life has value.  Even if an Muslim person felt the same way we do, there is little that they could do in a nation that suppresses women's rights.  Now I hope you don't think I support these actions, because I do not.  I was just stating how things are in some other nations around the world.  If you were living in a nation that had these beliefs it wouldn't matter much what your fundamentals are either.  The oppressed peoples of any nations will continue to be oppressed, until there is a revolution or change in societies practices.  So I doubt that there would be much you could do if you lived over in an area like this.  If there was something the average citizen could do, then why did the oppressed people of Iraq not overthrow their government?  Anyone who tried to make change in that area, was probably either murdered, or sent off to prison.  My point is, this is just one difference in how things are handled over in some Muslim societies.

===message:You make a great point. If we lived in a nation which practiced different beliefs,we would practice them also just as we do in the US. Although, looking in on those other nations from the US point of view is very disturbing.

===message:Teh way you explained it I dont like the US either.  What is wrong with the way a Countries opinion of the US.  We have opinion about them.  The only difference is they dont come over here and take over our land.  I really think you need to check what you say.  You make it seem as if if we want something we have the right to just go and take it.  For all it is worth I really did not care what Saddam did.  And niether did you until it was on CNN.  Then you really still dont care because it did not affect us until we went to war.  And it still don't affect us until another 9/11 occurs.  So I think you really misssed it on this one.  You put too much personal feelings versus the text.  Fortunately I am old enough to remember the situation surrounding the situation and basically they wanted the US to get its people out and tend to its own business.  The US had plenty of time to evacuate but they did not.

===message:<p>Wow, this is a touchy subject.  Al, I would like to say that my posting had nothing to do with other nations having no right to have an opinion of our society.  There is nothing wrong with Iraq or any other nation to having opinions on our nation.  I do believe there is a problem though, when terrorist groups come crashing into our cities.  You are right; I really haven’t cared much about what Saddam has done in the past because it has not affected me.  When 9/11 hit us though, it did transform our country and changed it in many ways.  You know, if people have not been affected by that tragic event, then that definitely says something about the patriotism about this nation.  It doesn’t take much to set off a few fireworks, and recite the National Anthem once a year, but it does take a lot for a nation to stand up as a whole, and respond to a national threat.  If we didn’t go over there and show the terrorists what we had to offer, then the next target they hit could be our backyard.  I also do not believe that we have to go over to every foreign land and drop bombs, but in some cases that is how we stand up for freedom, through war.</p>
   <p>These last few chapters in the book have been on communism and a great part of Islam and the Arabic world.  So please forgive me if I have ruffled your feathers a little, but there is no way that you can truthfully talk about a subject without having some feelings towards the fact in the book.  Speaking of me putting too much personal feelings on my posting, it just seems like you hurried along to post your reply, and anyone can see that if they inspect the grammar in the first few sentences of your text.</p>
   <p>In regard to anyone who has read my postings, I am sorry if I have offended anyone or said something that has been misinterpreted, but this posting was on Islamic values and the Arab world, and we all know this is a touchy subject these days.  So please forgive me if I have stepped on your toes.  In closing, I do believe every nation and person on this earth has his own right to opinion, life, and freedom.  I am not against foreign cultures, beliefs, or views in life; only their imposed pain and abuse on governments upon their people.</p>

===message:I'm no Islamic scholar but I do believe you have a great observation of the "whole" picture.  I think you've done a good job of evaluating both U.S. and our materialistic ways and the Islams and their religious ways.  Great Job!!!!!!

===message:Jordan, I believe we had a miscommunication, I was not stating if I lived there only if I was visiting. I would have to have the same values I have now in order to realize it was wrong to watch a man beat a woman for showing her face in public. With my current values I don’t think I could stand by and watch a man beat a woman for any reason. Fighting is one thing but to see a man beat a woman, how could I stand tall and have pride in myself if I just stood but and watched it happen? How could I look my wife in the face again?

===message:David, thanks for your clarification on what you meant earlier in the discussion.  I do understand how if you were visiting a country that mistreated women and with what you believe, how it would be difficult to just watch something like that happen.  I am sorry for my misinterpretation on what you said, and thank you again for clearing things up.  I appreciate your replies.

===message:Mr. Berkow I respect your opinion.  But, first let me say we are not graded on our typing skills.  But My point is in your discussing you feel it is ok to just trash Americans views whereever we feel we can gain the most at.  9/11 was a tragedy and for that people will pay but you should have beeen waving the flag befor 9/11. Everyone loves a battle cry and 9/11 has given those of you who never really cared about anything until in was on CNN.  How many nations have we committed 9/11 on?  But thier was no one to spank our hands.  So get real.  My point is that you discussing justifies everything we do in the name of difference.  If Muslims hate us then let them hate us.  If they cut off our finger then we cut off thier head.  AND TAKE THIER OIL.  If you look at the news today look how proud the Democracy uses the word KILL!  Its like they are hunting deer or something.  Thier is no compasion for nothing.  Now you will come back with the TC issue and truly it was a tragedy but do we really know that Saddam had anything to do with it NO we don't.  And as for you patritism statement.  Please everyone feels patritism but at the same time it should not take two planes going into a building to have patritism.  I served in the Military for 8 years and I saw the soldier on the Berlin Wall ready to shoot anyone who came near it.  So I think I have earned the right to be critical of US policy.  Just like the soldiers in IRAQ say they have thier own 52 most wanted list so 1 of them die a day so that makes them non patriotic.  I am sick and tired of you Arm Chair politicians waving your flag with a budweiser in the other hand codeming the right to have a opinion then hide behind that flag because of 9/11.   And if you want want to give me a F for my spelling then do it but my point should still be made.  I love this country but some of the decisions that we have made lately will cause my children and thier children to suffer.   PS   and yours too if you have any.

===message:Phew!!! Jordan, hold on. When you say, "This man does not understand the economic, cultural, or political drives of the United States. Whenever the U.S. intervenes or supports causes in the Middle east, the Muslim people usually just see this act as intrusion and aggression"...seems as though you have a personal vendetta against him. What's the deal?

Remember the Iraq/Iran war? Don't you think that left a bit of a bad taste in Khomeini's mouth? Read that section again on his speech and pay close attention to the specific words he use (repel, resist, intimidation, etc.)sounds like a country who has been oppressed to me. Had he not known of the experiences the Muslim world suffered, I don't think he would have had a speech to make!
