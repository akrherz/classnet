===message:Keeping with the containment which characterized the two superpowers in the cold war, the Islamic governments are fighting to keep and maintain their comfort zone, regardless of what the rest of their people think or feel.  As new generations approach, and they see and live in this and centuries to come, they are going to identify with the ways of the US and turn on their way of living.

===message:Both countries the Us and Islamic in my opinion will always have differences and will always be on constant outs with one another. Until one country is willing to say "Peace' and accept the other country as the most powerful one than there will always be conflict. For example. In your house hold normally it is a husband and wife and maybe children. Rather some people want to believe it or not your husband if there is a two parent home normally is considered the "man of the house" my point is we can't have two people at constant battle for power. Now that brings me back to the topic. We have to have a compromise when it comes to the power of tthe two countries and neither of them would like to compromise.  So there will always be a problem between the two nations.
