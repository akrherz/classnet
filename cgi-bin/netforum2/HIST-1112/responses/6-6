===message:I agree with your response beacuse people did lose loved ones and found that hard to cope with. I also agree that the people that lived during WW1 had to live day-by-day because they did not know what the next day held, just like life is in 2003. Tomorrow is not promised. So what should you do? Live for today.

===message:<p>I agree David, that most people hated war after World War I.  After all the loss of life and descruction of Nations, who would wish for more pain and suffering?  The people who went through the war, either at the front lines or back home and in the factories, all had to deal with the results of the war, and in different ways.  I would imagine also, that some people lived on from "day to day" to deal with their feelings.  It isn't healthy to dwell on the poor circumstances of life and stay depressed.  So after the war, it is probably a good statement to say that people tried to move on with their lives.  There were probably those who dealt with their feelings though with depression, anger, and being afraid.  All people deal with problems in different ways.  It just is a poor situation when entire Nations have to deal with the same thing all at once.  It would be nice to think that all people can get through a tough time in a country's history, and get past the feeling os sadness and anger.  It probably would be a wrong statement to say that all people get through it though.  This is just one of the many bad results of any war or conflict.</p>
