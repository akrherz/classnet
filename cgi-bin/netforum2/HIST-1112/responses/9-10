===message:I totally agree with your take on Khrushchev's definition of "free".  He did believe that communism was the way to go, that people would have their needs met.  Capitalism just didn't guarentee enough.  He probably knew that it would liberate those who would conform to it.

===message:I agree with you and  Diane that it makes people feel better knowing that they will be taken care of regardless but I think that also helps to hold them back. I believe that completion is a good thing and people that have to give all of there achievements away to only receive a portion of the total pie are not going to try and achieve as much as they would if they got all the rewards for what they do.

===message:You are exactly right! For example, people try to achieve good jobs in order to receive the benefits and good pay. If they had to work hard at these jobs and the benefits and profit went elsewhere, they wouldn't want the job in the first place. You make a great point.

===message:Hey its me again.  I sorta agree but I think we all missed the free part.  I truly that niether side did not want to make it into a Communist or Capitalist debate.  I truly believe that for what it was worth they tried to influence the nation that yours is good for you and ours is good for us.  Free who really knows the definition. But I do feel that they kept us in place with the fear of nuclear war.  Enjoyed your disscussions and hope you do well in the class.

===message:Hey Al. I respect your belief, but I believe that they tried to influence that their way (communist or capitalist) was what was best for everyone, but who really does know? I also enjoyed your discussions very much. Thanks for all of your responses and good luck to you. :)
