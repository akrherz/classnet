===message:Leon, I would have to agree with what you said.  We are always looking for an opportunity to "ease in". America does this all the time and it usually does not matter what the cost will be.  It all boils down to money, because the more money you have the more powerful you become. Big money = big power, little money = little power, no money =no power. That's just the way it is and it seems like thats the way it will always be.

===message:I agree with Leon's thought as the U.S. being seen as an "agressor." I do agree that many other developing countries feel threatened by the spread of U.S. mass culture. Would'nt we (the U.S.) feel threatened if another country tried to influence our culture?

===message:Shemika brings up a good point about "more money, more power." The more developed countries have always seeked a way to rule, influence, or gain favor of the less developed countries. I feel that any kind an advantage of wealth will always preside as a main key for power. Good point Shemika!

===message:I agree.  But not only the Islamic countries feared or disagreed with the Barbie, these countries do not accept women as equals and want to keep them under so much fabric, it is not even funny.  The Barbie influence in this country could mean tha their women will see a bette life, which is already taking place in some of their Islamic countries, and they will not have the control of their women, which means that their way of life and government will change, and probably be forgotten.

===message:Shemika,
Yep. A lot evolves around opportunities...capitalism, capitalism, capitalism!!! A what's in it for me syndrome. I don't want to sound negative, bcause there are reasons why I live in the US. But for those who have rose colored glasses on...get real! Let's stop forcing ourselves on others and let them be "themselves"!

===message:I agree with all views on the subject matter. It is the more wealth, power, and money that a country obtains that determines what country is or becomes the most powerful, influential and dominating. It is wonderful to live in a country that is very powerful. This a very good incentive and benefit of being a citizen and loving every moment of the United States of America.
