===message:I wanted to elaborate on Mr. Ellis comment on pollution from industralization. The conditions of urban areas in the late 19th century were horrendous. Diseases,premature deaths, and unbearable living conditions were widespread and almost unimaginable to society today.The current conditions of urban areas are impeccable compared to over 100 years ago. Industrialization in part forced the government to improve sanitation and enhance the quality of the publics lives allowing a cleaner environment for us to live in today.
