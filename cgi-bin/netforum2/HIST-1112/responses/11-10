===message:Diane you said in your essay “I think that the United States has a great deal of influence in the world today. I actually don't see anything wrong with it. If I did, what would I be saying about the U.S.?” I think it is your duty to tell the government if you think what they do is wrong. I know you don’t believe they are wrong in this instance, but I am referring to “If I did, what would I be saying about the U.S.? This is our government designed to do what the majority believe is right or wrong, and they only know what we tell them. I like the rest of your essay.

===message:You're right!  I guess I wasn't speaking that from the political point of view.  In that case I would, that's why I vote.  As far as people having their own ideas and freedom to make their own choices about insignificant things, I don't see anything wrong with that.  The biggest compliment you can get is for someone to copy you.

===message:<p>I too believe that the United States has tremendous influence in the world today.  Whether is it through our culture, economy, or technological advantages, nations get a really close view of the U.S.  I don’t believe that it is equally true with every country though.  For instance, most the third world nations aren’t able to as freely broadcast their society to the world.  The only news we usually hear of these countries are from our own television news associations.  This is one advantage that we have as Americans to influence the world.  Following up on this statement, I believe that is a big reason why some countries are afraid or reject the United State’s culture.  These other nations which don’t have the privileges as we do with technology are more inclined to perceive us as intrusive and dominating.  </p>
  <p> This isn’t the major reason I believe nations are more skeptical about U.S. customs.  I believe that some countries just have high regards to their own customs and nationalistic feelings.  The way Americans dress, act in public, spend their free time, and practice different religions, vary immensely with other places in the world.  China is a good example of not permitting much interaction with the entire world for centuries.  If these countries feel the way they do about mixing cultures, then there is little anyone can do about that.  This is just my opinion on how I perceive nations rejecting U.S. culture.</p>
  <p> In conclusion I would like to say that any person and society is entitled to hold on to their own customs and cultures.  No one should be forced to change, because if they are, then how is the change of any value?  Any forced change on a society or person that isn’t voluntary has no true value.</p>

===message:I do agree with you Diane that other countries are terrified of the U.S. influence, but I do not believe that other countries should take something as the spread of mass U.S. culture lightly. I think it would be a shame if every culture were to adopt the western culture or any one culture for that matter. I feel that it is the diversity of many cultures that create an understanding and growth within our nation.(although I know it has created disagreement) Many countries do not want to have the essence of their culture transformed. In a sense, it would be a destruction of their freedom. The freedom to uphold their own culture and traditions.

===message:What if those people aren't copying you because they want to but because they have to. If the ways businesses are structured around you change you will have to change with it or go under. That has to do with the economic change that seems to happen when a US business comes into town. I don't know if that makes any sense, but not everyone who is influenced by the US wanted to be influenced by the US. That I think is one of the problems, us imposing our will on other people.
