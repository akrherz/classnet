===message:I agree with you assesment only if you are looking at one side of the coin.  Imperialism had its merits based on the region that it occured in.  Many times the ruling faction intended on good but because of the great wealth that could be consumed it really got lost.  I have to believe that many wanted to do the best for the country by greed settled in.

===message:What were the good intentions if they were taking these colonies by force for personal gain through trade, investments and business activities? The greed was there to begin with.
