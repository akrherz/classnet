If the people don’t want to change then don’t change. That is one of the freedom’s in America, we can have as many tattoos or spikes in your hair as we want. We can belong to any religious organization we want to we just can’t force other people to believe what we believe.

===message:David, Sorry about that.  That was a typo.  That sentence should have read "The Islamic people do not want to change and they would rather “die a bloody death than submit to humiliation and abjection” from the United States."
Now, you stated that "we just can't force people to believe..."  Well that is true.  Unfortunately everywhere there is always someone who will try to persuade you to believe in something.  At times this persuasion can get out of hand and turn into force. When you say "people don't have to change if they don't want to" ,this can be easier said than done.  When you have people threating to kill you or imprison you if you don't change, what do you do? You can fight back or you can give in and change.  In America we supposedly have freedom to do pretty much anything we want as long as we don't interfer with others freedom. Yet everyday the courts are filled with cases of people who are standing trial because they thought they had the freedom to do whatever it was they did, but it turns out they did not. People force us to believe stuff all the time.  For example I don't think my employer would be too excited about me going to meet a client with my hair spiked and a tattoo on my neck.  To me, it may be a freedom of expression.  To my employer and the potential client it makes me look like a gangsta or something. If I am really free to do what I want then it should be against the law for my employer to terminate me or even ask me to get rid of my spikes and tattoos.
