Think of it this way, a person is only successful once they make a million dollars.  Is this true?  It depends who is measuring success.  A student may think he/she is successful once they have passed their history class.  A parent may be successful once their child graduates from high school.

Another thought for consideration, Atlanta is a great city to live in.  To a person who is homeless or who was victimized by violence, Atlanta may be the worst place to live.  To a person who has started a booming business and became a millionare, Atlant may be a great place to live.

Whether or not a nation is great is contingent upon the person or groups of persons evaluating the nation, not the industrialization of that nation.

===message:Yes and no.  Industrialization helped because it provided more opportunity for employment as well as a faster way to produce goods; it was bad because of the horrible conditions people had to work under along with very long hours. One improvement on the lives of people due to industrialization is the fact that lots of people moved from working in the fields into factories; the downside is the fact that they are inside the factories.  There was not much ventilation inside those buildings, which caused lots of health problems for people, especially women, and children.  As far as a nation being great, I feel the answer to that is yes.  In today's world, money is what makes a nation powerful<or "great">.  And without becoming industrialized, I do not see a nation being great, which ties into imperialism and industrialization's relationship.  Imperialism is the "expansion of European powers and their conquest, colonization of African and Asian societies..."(textbook G-4).  With industrialization, that is exactly what happened.  European powers spread due to them being industrialized and making money of the products made at a faster pace.  If I am wrong, please let me know.  Thanks.

===message:I disagree.  A nation is considered "great" because of wealth, which is money.  Without having money, which is power<to some degree>, a nation can not/will not be considered "great".  I agree that some unindustrialized countries have strong family ties; however, strong family does not make a nation "great".  That's just my opinion.

===message:I think you are absolutely correct in your assessment of what makes a nation "great".  In considering whether an unindustrialized nation could be great, I felt that it was not possible but was having difficulty articulating it.  You are right, unindustrialized nations may have a number of positive attributes, but can they really be considered great in relation to the world?  I don't think so.

===message:I have to say that I agree with everything you have stated Jordan. Industrialization has obviously been an important factor in the advancement of life. It has also been one of the driving forces behind breaking up family unity. Unindustrialized countries do seem to have more closely nit families. I especially like your statement about the quality of life resting in “the motivation and will of the people of that country.”
