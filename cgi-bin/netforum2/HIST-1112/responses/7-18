===message:It is often that we escape as you will, our true feelings through Art. Art reflected the changing World of Age of Anxiety through freedom and expression. If people are not able to say what they would like to say their feelings, beliefs and perspective about things they may write songs, dance, run or draw a portrait. In this case, the people are surely expressing some insecurities about who they are and where do they belong. Remember a lot of these families were efffected by the War and was left without a father, husband or brother. Physics and Pyschology aroused during these times. People expressed their time through experimentation in art and literature. Facism, communism, and nationalism seemed to be doing well during the uncertain times was becuse they offered an alternative plan that was producing results that appealed to the population in dispear.
