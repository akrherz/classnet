===message:Why does the American way of life have to be threatening to other cultures? I enjoy eating chinese, Japanese and Italian foods often. I think it's a great change, not a threat to my culture. I'm sure you enjoyed having the option of eating the traditional American foods you know and love while being away from home also.

===message:I am so glad that I have had the oppuntunity to experiance different cultures and traditions so early in my life.  I feel that being able to travel to different countries and Islands is a wonderful experiance for anyone.  It is quite a culture shook in some places if you don't know what to expect before had.  I also feel that I have a more open view to differances in our society because I have seen how people in other parts of the world live.  I really don't think that all "other cultures" feel threatened by the US.  It is just like in the United States, there are a select few of individuals that are heard over the rest of the crowd.

===message:You're absolutely right. Many people in foreign countries like the American way. It's those who don't that are the loudest. Good point.

===message:I agree with you.  I, too, traveled and it wasn't only the Americans in Saudi who were enjoying the American cuisine, buying American music, and American style of clothing.  Plus, it was the Saudi's (or other nationalities) making money from it.  Who's to complain about that?  We were consuming American products (and some foreign products to take home) and putting money into their economy.  Go figure!

===message:I think that you will agree that being able to travel to different places opens your eyes to things that not everyone has the chance to see.  You relize that we are not as bad as the information age has made us out to be.
