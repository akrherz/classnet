===message:I agree with you about WWWI in being the bloodiest war then previous wars. It was a war that was very destructive and a lot of civilians lost their lives because of this war. All the other wars were bloody and terrible as well but I have to agree that this one WWWI was the worst. It seems as if after a war follows negotiations and peace. Doesn't it seems as if this should be negotiated prior to war? I imagine with every war there are a new set of laws, and organizations that are formed.
