===message:I respect your opinion but I think you missed this one.  The Islamic World has never felt inferior to the United States.  I truly don't think that is what you meant but I will respond on what you said.  The main problem that they had with the US is the seizing and assiting of seizing of thier land.  I think that thier are several of Islamic countries who do very well economically that we depend on for 1 reason or another (IRAQ, OIL) and I feel the Islamic fait would like the US to keep thier noses out of thier business.

===message:The US does have economic dependencies on the Islamic nations, such as oil. Maybe the Islams don't feel inferior to the US, but I do believe that they feel threatened.

===message:I agree with you Stephanie, I believe the Islamic nations do feel inferior to America if only because there culture has been around for hundred or even thousands of years and they still have the same beliefs. The world is not flat, the sun does not revolve around the earth and you will not fall of the edge of the world if you sail far enough. The Islamic nation’s want to hold onto ideas that century’s old and that is why they fear America, we bring new and modern concepts to there country.
