===message:Man, I think about the same stuff sometimes. It does aggravate me when we as a country get involved in "other" people's business a little too much! Take for instance, the many covert military actions during the Kennedy, Carter, Regan, and Bush administrations. How we tend to cover up what is really happening and the real motives of "our" (US) actions towards other countries in the name of "democracy" and "economic and political freedoms for others". Aren't our actions a bit too imperialistic?

Well, enough said. As for imperialism, there is great progress but unfortunately at the great expense and the lives of others involving selfsh motives of the imperialist invaders. So is that really progress...? Depends on who is taking inventory. If we remember in our reading the many skirmishes, rebellions of the indigenous peoples (i.e., the Haitian Revolution, etc.)to liberate them selves from the "imperialist invaders", these people suffered sometimes great castastrophic losses of life and health in the name of progress. I guess if they would have wanted the imperialist there in the beginning, it may have been a much warmer welcome. Sure, progress came from from it, but at whose expense? Sure both sides lost lives, but the reality of it all (from my view) is that the imperialist forced a way of life upon a people who might not have invited them in the beginning.
