===message:You make a great point about nationalism. It is definately an important part of our country and others as well. Our military forces and the support of our nation is a perfect example. It is very powerful and is what makes our country strong. Nationalism in the United States is here to stay.

===message:I Like your assesment but you must realize Nationalism is not totally accepted in most of the world.   Many countries outside of CNN still operate under dictatorship and regimes.  This is very evident based on the Headlines in the news today.  And in retrospect my personal feeling is that some countries are better off with the way thier government has run for centuries.  The burden that is caused by the conquering countries have major ramifications to the existing country and the conquring country.

===message:I also agree with Mr. Boyer in thinking that Nationalism is important. I feel it had a great part in shaping today’s world as we know it. WW2 was brought on by a great sense of Nationalism on behalf of the German’s, Italian’s and Japanese. They each felt that their nation was the best and fought to dominate those nations that were considered lesser. Mr. Desmond is also correct in pointing out that Nationalism is ‘not totally accepted in most of the world.’ But those countries that don’t have a strong sense of Nationalism are still affected by Nationalism itself.

===message:I agree totally with your view of the importance of nationalism.  I think when people can find commonalities between them, that may impact the entire nation, they weaken all the  differences that separate them.  I think that people really do want to feel that they belong to a larger group, the "voice" of a nation.  And when the nation is under attack, the "voice" rallies the cause and shows a mighty united front. Nationalism is still viable in today's society.  After September 11, the United States was truly made united in its' call against terrorism as well as its' unwavering display of nationalism.

===message:I agree with the point that Mr. Boyer stresses. The importance of nationalism. It is indeed displayed in the people that stand for their country and culture in times of hostility and war. I also feel that nationalism has had the most lasting effect. Although nationalism has led to prejudice and arrogance against other countries in the past, the importance of protecting and fostering the interest of the people still holds value today.
