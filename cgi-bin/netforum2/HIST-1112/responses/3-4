===message:I personally believe that liberalism and conservatism was the most important and still have repercussions. I state this because, Liberalism are beliefs that include positive government actions to improve the welfare of individuals and tolerance for social/political change. Conservatism are beliefs that includes a limited role in national government in helping individuals, support for tradional values/lifestyles and cautious respond to changes.Conservatives believe that an individual is responsible for his/her own well-being.Today, conservatives feel that the national government has outgrown and sectors do not need any interference from the governtment.They want social welfare programs to be limited and local/ state agencies should make their own decisions and strengthen the nations defense. On the other hand, Liberals are understood to embrace the national government solutions to the the public problems. Today, Liberals are more concerned with policies of supporting women's rights,civil rights, and increase defense spending. So as you can see conservatism have the upper hand over liberalism.
