===message:Imperialism did little to help small countries. If you are looking at it from the point of view of a developed country that wants to trade with lesser develop countries your statement is correct. If you look at it from a small countries point of view you would see that imperialism was only good for slavery and exploitation. I have seen the many plantations and I have heard many stories passed down from generation-to-generation in Caribbean islands. Stories of people being abused and murdered for not keeping up with work on plantations. There is no justification for Imperialism because it was merely a means for developed countries to exert their dominance on lesser-developed countries.

===message:Yes, imperialism brought about the advancement of society on a larger scale and helped smaller countries connect trade with others. But, did this help the smaller countries or hurt them? Many were satisfied with life as it was and were not interested in anyone coming in to take them over.

===message:I agree with your view partly.  Imperialism really only depended on the overthrowing of the leaders not the whole nattion.  Many of these population succommoned to the leading faction.  You must admit that the population always outweighed the rulers but because of the army, control of the resources the people had to follow the dictatorship.  Many imperialist leaders came to power after overthrowing the leaders.

I don't think that Imperialism helped every county.  There are still islands out there that have been "claimed" that still live in poverty with no hope of advancement.  The Island people depend heavly on outside help on sustaining life.  Because of this dependance I think that we have hurt them.

===message:It's kind of like the old saying, "What you don't know won't hurt you."  I believe the smaller countries could have benefitted more if larger countries hadn't come in in their imperialistic ways.  They were abused, treated with indignity, and injustice.  For what?  For larger countries to come in and exploit their land's goods and treat these people with injustice and not allow them to be in charge of their own land.  Who knows what would have been the better way to get the most use out of the lands and the goods that could be acquired from it???

===message:I believe that imperalism did not have  any relevance in our government. One may make statements about their justficiation of imperalism but the bottom line is the whole idea if imperalism is "Control" over people and government. I can't imagine being told I am worth .25. And that is exactly the type of government that imperalism  supports. Slavery was real, plantations were real and this type and form of government was real. I do not want to go backward in history but forward. Aren't we all entitled to freedom, control of our persons,place and belongings? I am are you?
