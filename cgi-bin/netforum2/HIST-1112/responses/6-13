===message:<p>I like your assessment on the different perspectives that people had over the war.  I also believe that civilians outright feared war at the end of the conflict.  I know that everyone thought that the war would be a quick ordeal, bringing peace to the world, but that didn’t happen.  It was one of the longest international brawls and losses of life that the world had yet seen.  I think that a big reason why civilians feared war was because there was no mercy on the civilian populations.  The German’s air bombing zeppelins was one way to bring fear to the homeland.  There also had to be a continuous fear of being attacked at sea.  As German's attacked supply ships in the Atlantic.  Working in munitions factories where explosives and chemicals were being process had to also be stressful.  The constant chance of an explosion or exposure to certain chemicals had to being some sort of reaction to the women who had to work while the men fought.</p> 
<p>The views of war for the politician and military leaders had to vary greatly than the common person.  Early in the war, I am sure that the leaders of the nations were willing and ready for war.  Near the end of the way though, with a fading economy, fading war debt, and losses of millions, the leaders had to have some soft of ill feelings towards war.  Not to say they didn’t feel it was necessary to go to war.  Some wars can be avoided, but as conflict and different issues build up in nations, war can not be avoided.  This was the case of World War I.</p>

===message:I don't think it is likely that war can be prevented.  As long as there are different idealogies floating around, there are bound to be conflicts of interest. It has been proven throughout the entire history of man that you cannot please everybody.  Just as some might be willing to engage in war, there will always be some who thinks that war should be prevented, thus causing a conflict.  As you stated "sometimes force is needed to prevent war..." Well we have seen that this is nearly impossible.  World War I and World War II both  escalated when this tactic was used. To prevent Ferdinand from taking the throne, he was assasinated, which then resulted in war.  In World War II, Japan used force to take over China, which ultimatly lead the the outbtreak of war.

===message:<p>Al made a great point by stating that we as individuals are the greatest weapons against war. The majority of countries today are nations in which leaders are elected through popular vote. Therefore individuals are very responsible for their leaders actions and must make a conscious effort to get to know and understand the nature of political candidates. Then they must go out and vote. This is one reason why war can be avoidable.<p>

===message:Yep! I am in agreement that..."people are the greatest weapon against war"... and I know that the vote counts. But unfortunately, it's impossible at times to really know the deep inner persuasions of the individual that "we" elect in office. They can put up a smoke screen campaign promosing "this and that", representing "this and that", but when in office they turn out to be the very opposite of what they promised to stand for. You see, we have a deeper issue than picking the "right person off the paper ballot". We as a country, as a society, as a people, need a "real" change in our thinking, and the way we perceive others. The problems that we suffer are too deeply rooted to get rid of over night. It is like a poison that has been circulating for centuries. That imperialistic attitiude within us is too deep to get out in a short period. We need a new breed of people to elect as leaders. Those who will not sell out to the ideals of imperialism, and who will represent the truth and honesty for just causes and a just society.
