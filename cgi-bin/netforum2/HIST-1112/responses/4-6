===message:I am glad to see that you also feel that the Industrial Revolution has given us the opportunity to improve our social status. Everyone has the opportunity to improve through education and hard work. Those who choose to improve will and those who aren't willing to work for it will remain unchanged in society.

===message:I agree with you if we only look at the upside of your argument.  My biggest problem with the industrial revolution is that so many nations became misplaced without and attempt of inclusion.  This existed then and it still exists today..  I am definetely with you as it pertains to advancement but the few who prosper do not compare to the many who sacrafice. I also teeter on the idea of education allows one to succeed.  I personally feel that thier are other factors that denounces a person's educational status that is held against him or her when it comes to success based on education.  But for the most part I feel where you are coming from but only if you are looking through a very clean window!

===message:I totally agree with your summary.  Industrialization did make commodities cheaper so that members of the lower classes could afford some of the luxuries that were out there.  It has given opportunities to all levels of classes, genders, and races.  Whether it be to purchase items, work in the production, shipping, or selling of the items, many people have more opportunities of taking advantage of the possibilities.
