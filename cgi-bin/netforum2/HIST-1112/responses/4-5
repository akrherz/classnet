===message:Ms. Chadwick your argument is good but has holes.  You are lumping everybody into one catagorie which I feel is not exactly right.  In many areas outside cable television thier are many people who still work as hard as the lady you used in your example.. Contrary these jobs still exist.  Even with the technology many countries for what ever reason do not have them.  Take a look at some of the undeveloped countries that still use the crafts of thier forfathers to get the job done.  I think many times in our comfortable lives we tend to forget that the industrial age is not everywhere and where it is it has in some cases destroyed civilization's in the name of progress!

===message:Al, I kind of see your point,  but work today doesn't quite compare to the work of Betty Harris. Yes, other countries may still be undeveloped, but the purpose of my response was to give examples of how industrialization HAS improved peoples lives. So what do you mean by "holes?" I know industrialization is not everywhere, but surely you see the benefits it has given the US. Don't you?
