===message:You make some excellent points about Global Powers and their problems with the Versailles Treaty.  Germany in particular was hard hit by the Versailles Treaty.  They were not included in on the convention that decided the outcome of their future.  When Wilsons Fourteen Points were not agreed apon Germany was not happy.  I believe that they never forgave that powers and this was a leading factor to WWII

===message:I agree, you make good points.  I, too, believe that WWII was a continuation of WWI.  The treaties that were set up evidentally didn't make everyone happy.  (Like that will ever happen!)

===message:No Mr. Shealey I dont think so.  I truly dont feel that this was a continuation of WWI.  I think the causes for this war started totally different from the first war.  This war started in Japan and ended in Europe.  This war was more based on personal differences of cultural.  But I do agree with the ending about how the super powers came about!

===message:Al, remember that Japan rambo-ed their way into China. Imperialism...! They (Japan) as most power controlling countries and leaders (in the making) do wait for a "carpet ride" to grab on before they make their move. That "carpet ride" for Japan was WW I in which Japan had utilized to do so.

So in saying this, just as the Serbs wanted to "shake, rattle, and roll" loose from the grips of others...that same pervasive spirit of "let me be free" was still prevalent from the 1600's through the 1700's and well in to the 19th and 20th centuries in the minds of many societies.
