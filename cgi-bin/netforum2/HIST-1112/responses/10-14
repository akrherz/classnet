===message:Leon, I totally agree with you! Isn't it ironic that we are having this discussion with the state of the world today?! The Islamic people have seen the Americans as "evil wrongdoer's" from the beginning. We have infringed on their land and beliefs for years. This isn't a new conflict. It's just a new President, in a new era, with an old vendetta. The 9/11 attacks were horrendous yes, but we can't have this hatred for all Islamic people. We can't go around blowing up smoke screens for our benefit. We claim that we are in Iraq now looking for the weapons of mass destruction, but President Bush is claiming we are fighting for our freedom and the freedom of the Iraqi people. Have the Iraqi people asked for our help? I have a word for you, can you say o-i-l!! Just like we have a few nut jobs in our country blowing up buildings, (Timothy McVeigh) so do the Islamic countries (Osama Bin Laden). America is such a hypocritical country! But I wouldn't live anywhere else!!

===message:I partially agree. I have to say that not all Islamic people feel Americans are "of the Devil". Some wanted to be released from the torture and given a chance at true freedom - no worries (governmentally). I do think much of the war is an us against them, however George Bush obviously felt that the country was in need and he was there to help. The rest of your assessment is accurate and I think you did a good job.

===message:In the wake of the killings of Hussein's sons, I heard on the radio (SRN News) today that a poll shows that 44% Americans (up sharply than before) believe that Islams are likely to promote violence. What are we saying as a country? Is it right to single out a whole religion for the sake of a few? Sounds a bit of prejudice to me.

Why would people advocate a poll like that to promote more finger pointing a group of people that we (the public)probably don't know a whole lot about? Interesting!!!

===message:Jasmine,

Thanks for the correction! And the compliment. I re-read my posting and realized that the assumption "all" should have not been used. But what I meant by "all" (in quotation) was not really meant to be "all" per-se. But an assumption of "all". Confusing huh? (smile)

===message:Leon, Polls like this should not be taken.  But isn't this the same as saying all Americans are greedy & Glutton.  We souldn't single out ones religion or Country.  There is good in all of us.
