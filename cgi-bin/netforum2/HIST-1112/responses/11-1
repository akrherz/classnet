===message:Brother, I could not have said it any better. I got a good laugh and I 100% agree with you. Most of the people in America today seem to have lost there minds and there censes left with them.

===message:Why not call it what it trully is US invasion or US occupied or lets just call it greed!  I like your assesment but I disagree with the way you explain it.  Some of the points you make have a double edge sword.  I do appreciate the candor on the things you agree with but the things you don't agree with are very obvious.  If US can go into IRAQ and place this great Democracy to people based on OIL.  Then why don't the American Citizens deserve the same.  the Americans genicide the Indians and demoralized the African American and who can name the races on and on.  This course if nothing else has taught us how Americans always negotiate thier way out of everything except Vietnam.  They just left.  So why does everyone have to just except the will of the US.. Democracy is not for everyone why don't we just except that as a country.

===message:Greed may sum it up best. Apathy is another word that comes to mind when talking about Americans believing they have any voice in their own government anymore. I really don't believe the governed has consented to what has been happening in this country. Most people are afraid to take a stand against bueracracies that serve themselves first and the citizen is only of secondary importance...if that. 
<p>
Most things in life a are double edged sword. For every right and freedom we enjoy there is a corresponding responsibility each citizen has to ensure their continuation. "Lack of responsibility" is another phrase that comes to mind not only of the leadership but the average citizen.

I think that brings us full circle back to greed and selfishness again.

===message:Wow!  I am thoroughly fascinated by your assessment and I agree with you on almost all points (the only exception being that I enjoy Survivor!).  Since I feel somewhat frightened by the cultural differences in my own country, certainly other countries are extremely hesitant about another country’s influence.  I go into a brief period of shock just going to New York and trying to adjust to the behaviors there!
