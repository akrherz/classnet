===message:I was just wondering what recent wars that you feel were unnecessary and why do you feel they should not have taken place? No one wants war, but isn't there reason behind them all?

===message:Specifically, our recent “regime change” in Iraq was unnecessary, because it was based on outright lies about the existence of weapons of mass destruction and the American public's misconceived notion that Saddam Hussein had anything to do with the attacks on the World Trade Center. In addition, there was no reason for the United States to be involved in the conflict in Vietnam. Interestingly enough, our involvement there was also based on an outright lie – regarding “unprovoked attacks” on US destroyers that should never have been in the Gulf of Tonkin in the first place.
<p>
Based on the wars and regional and ethnic conflicts that have taken place in the past century, I conclude there is much passion and rationalization – but very little reason – behind any war.

===message:I agree with your feelings concerning our recent war.  I think the American people were misled in order to support someone's political motive.  Personally I feel the war was a family thing.  (Finish what dad didn't)  The question that I would like to get an answer on one day is whether the lives lost, the soldiers emotional stress, and the other complications from war, worth it?

===message:I appreciate and respect your response. You give very good reasoning for your opinion on war, but what about cases of attack like the twin towers? Who knows why they did it, but the United States had very good reason to declare war.

===message:I have to disagree with you feeling concerning our recent war.  I do not think that the American people were misled to support someones political motives.  One single person does not make that decision on their own.  Plenty of research and meetings are held before a President hastily sends our brother and sisters off to war.  I believe that when our soliders are sent to fight it is the presevation of our freedom.  Unless we stand in their shoes, we will never know the stress and emotional complications that they have experienced.  I also try to look at the flip side of the coin when talking about the lost lives.  Many other people lost their lives before we went over there in their defense.  Was the war worth it?????  Yes I believe that the war was worth the lives that we did save.

===message:In our recent war the public was led to believe that Saddam had a major supply of weapons of mass destruction. Although nothing has been found to date, there still may be the possibility that the weapons existed.  I am not arguing that point.  But since there weren't any weapons found, and there wasn't a declaration of war on the United States from Saddam (none that I am aware of), I want to understand what was the rush to go to war.  How is America better today, than it was before we went to war?
<p>
Although the decision is made collectively from Congress, a president has much power to influence his peers.  Also the way our government is setup, the president can declare war.  
<p>
Although I may not have stood in the shoes of soldier's that have served in the Middle East or other wars, I have had close friends and family who have.  Any time there is a threat of war, the main topic of our discussions is why.  Of course, they realized once they joined the military, they joined to support their country, but I don't think they realized they joined to support the political motives of our leaders.  Some of the wars the U.S. were involved in were not our battles to fight.
<p>
Although many may not agree with my opinions, I feel very strongly about staying out of other people's business affairs unless their is a direct impact or threat to our country.  If our leaders really want to fight a war, they should use our soldiers to fight a war against drugs, crime, and other torturous acts here in the United States.  I feel we spend too much time protecting people in other countries, and we forget about our own.  We have spent a countless number of dollars fighting a war in the Middle East, but in some neighborhoods in the United States, students can't get a proper education because crimes and drugs have taken over.

===message:Regarding your comments on the attack on the World Trade Center: There are people out there who passionately hate America, because they believe we are the cause of, or at least largely contribute to, the poverty and misery in which they live. We had every right to retaliate against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban. However, this pre-emptive attack on Iraq had absolutely positively nothing to do with the World Trade Center. Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the World Trade Center. I think that is a distinction that desperately needs to made, as so many Americans seem to be horribly mistaken about who was behind that WTC attack and about why we are in Iraq.

===message:I agree!  As you said, just because there were not weapons of mass destruction found, does not mean they weren't there.  When was the last time Sadam Hussein was up-front, trustworthy, and straight-forward about anything he ever did or said?  He's the guy that murders and rapes his own!!!!  Pretty honest fella, NOT!  I think if we were to give the guy an inch, he'd take it and whatever else he could get.
<p>
I also believe that after the Gulf War (1991), people enlisting knew war was a possibility at any time.  I'm sure that is why some enlisted, wanted to fight for their country.

===message:You have some very excellent points.  I have alot of doubt as to why we were so haste in declaring war, but as Diane Mercer wrote in another reply, can Saddam really be trusted???  I do believe that the weapons are out there.....somewhere.  I am not completly sure that we are better, than when we went to war, but I know that many people in Irag are glad we are there.  "Why" will always be a topic of discussion when there is a war, if we didn't ask why, then we ought to be living in a communist country.  When a solider joins the Military, they swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States and to support the Commander in Chief(the president).  So when the President believes that going to war is the right thing to do for our country, then they are sworn to uphold and support his decision.  I also agree with you that there are many wars here in the United States that need to be resolved, but if you look at statistics, those battles are being fought and won.
