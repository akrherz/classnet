===message:Although I agree that the depression inspired some artists, I believe that their paintings reflected more on escaping from the dim reality and looking for good and happiness in what could be or had been before. The bright colors are one technique they used to express happiness and not focus on how bad things really were. Art was their way to get away for a while and also allow those who viewed their art to escape form reality for a brief moment.

===message:You could be right Stephanie, I was not only looking at the colors but at the pictures also. The way they are distorted leads me to think that the artist is trying to say something about the way they are looking at life. Before this time period most of the artwork was more like pictures or literal paintings (I believe that is what they are called). I think the abstract (again I believe that is what they are called) artwork did not begin coming out until after WW1. This is all my personal belief, not fact, in my house we have paintings of farm houses, horses and county seines.

===message:<p>It is true that hopelessness was a great cause and effect with the success of fascism, communism, and nationalism during the post-war era.  The great depression affected millions of people in nations all over the world.  Unemployment was high percentage in the nations, while those who did work, earned less for their labor.  The debt of the war nations and the state of the world influenced everyone someway or another.  With uncertain economies, absence of work, and a weary nation, new leaders stepped up with new ideals to lead their countries.</p>
<p>The communist party in Russia thought that capitalism was on the downfall and transformed the entire country into a Socialist Republic.  With the abolition of private property and government owned industries, Lenin figured this would bring stability to the war torn land and equality to the people.</p>  
<p>The Fascist movement was against liberal democracy and communism.  This movement was focused on a national community that shared unique ethnic and racial identities.  This nationalism of the people had great fear or hatred toward other ethnic groups.  The most major hatred seen during this time was between the Jews and the Germans.  The theory that a nation could be a racial pure community was one of the drives of Nazi Fascism.</p>
<p>Nationalism can be seen as productive in nations such as the United States, France, Britain and many others.  These nations sought to bring stability to their communities through economical growth and industry.</p>
<p>No matter what ideal or government type the nation had, these Nations all sought to make society better economically and socially.  Whatever government was formed, the majority of the people accepted it, because they had to put all their hope and trust into their national leaders.</p>

===message:I agree that technological innovations changed the way people lived, basically gave birth to modern culture; and to express this new world art adapted a more intense and abstract presentation. The mere definition of art was challenged and redefined several times in the period between world war one and two. World War 1 and the subsequent depression afterwards, showed the world the horror that modern man can make. The invention of the photogragh made painting images for record keeping and news obsolete; but painting was still really useful for an artist expression of abstract ideas, emotions, and preceptions.
Communism, fascism, and nationalism was in response to the Depression. Unrest and uncertainity in the future drove poeple to take extreme measures in government to insure safety, food, and work. Every country needed to get organized and motivated to over come the depression. Many countries adopted many different ways of dealing with social and economical problems. Some solutions interfered with other agendas both internal and external to the country's government, a trait that characterized the age of anxiety

===message:David, I don't think that the camera was ever intended to be a competitor of the artist. You mentioned that it takes more time to paint a painting. And.... Although a lot can be captured in a photo, there is something about a painting that a photograph can't compete with (nor capture). Have you ever seen a beautiful mountain, take a picture of it and later look at it and say, " boy...that dosen't represent the same excitement I had when I saw it". The beauty of a painting is that the artist perception of the subject matter is one thing and your perception is another. The artist has the ability to let you be the interpreter of the piece too. You have the option of "adding" your thoughts, emotions, interpretation, etc. That's the beauty of a painting. You can cry if you want or you can laugh. With a photograph, it is what it is. 

I think that era was so turbulent, all forms of art and media had the opportunity to capture and express the times using their own available means.
