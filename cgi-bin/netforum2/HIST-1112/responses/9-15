===message:Conswella,

Do you really think that anyone really benefitted from the Cold War? I don't think that this was a vehicle that allowed opportunities for anyone to benefit. There was much chaos (riotings, attempted political coups, confusion, disgruntleness (women, blacks, minorities) due to the racisms, inequalities, tensions from nuclear armament, and on both sides (US and the Soviets), as well as great tension throughout the world for fear of nuclear holocaust! Where is the benefit? Just a thought.

===message:I would have to say that I agree with Conswella on this issue. I believe the U.S. and the Soviets both benefited from the Cold War. I understand Leon's point about the large amount of suffering among the people of the two countries. The people that suffered the most was the common people, not the government as a whole. I believe the citizens of these countries had differing opinions than that of their respective governments. The ordinary people just wanted peace, food, and the opportunity to give their families a better life. They weren't worried about who the superpowers were or what these "superpowers" were trying to accomplish. They wanted what everyone else wanted, Peace! Now that's my thought. Thanks. :)

===message:The US and the Soviet were the superpowers that created a containment and prevented a lot of developments, and like Leon saids, where is the benefit in that, many people were oppressed and actually I think they were just tired of the hole active war or cold war situation.  Don't you think?

===message:I will have to agree with Leon and point out something in Tiffany’s reply. I feel that both governments benefited politically, for a while. But the general public, who were supposed to be the focus of the government did not benefit as much as the ‘could have.’ Leon brought up the issue of suffering by the people, different five years plans that ultimately had some type of good also had a dramatic direct bad effect for the common people.
