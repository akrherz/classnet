===message:If asked the question "Is industrialization more important than our health?" most of us would say no. But, if you think about it, that is how we live and the only way most of us know. Although the industrialization causes alot of pollution, what would we do without it? Could society function?

===message:Stephanie you asked "Is industrialization more important than our health?"  I would also say no.  We have grown up in this modern world and most of us would not last in a world before industrialization.  "Little House on the Praire" was a dream world compared to the actual lives people back then lived in.  I'll take the air pollution, for the luxuries I enjoy today.

===message:How could you say that industrialization is more important than our health when our world is being polluted and causing the ozone layer to thin. The pollution of the earth has been going on for years and it is causing health problems to many people all over the world. I don't think you would enjoy your luxeries if you are going through kemo and your hair is missing because you enjoy your luxeries which are made in the process of destroying the earth and causing new health problems to appear. Everyone needs to take care of mother earth because this is the only place we know of that we can live comfortably. No one knows whats beyond what we have.

===message:If you think of it as overall improvement for the world population,no. There is still slavery in some parts of the world, child labor and sweatshops for cheap wage earnings. Industrialization has made life more convenient with transportation,technology, and more cuisines to eat. It help scientist to explore better possibilities at finding ingredients for cures to diseases. The negative impact of industrialization has caused the gap between the rich and the poor to widen because of machines replacing human labor which caused unemployment to rise. With unemployment comes more criminal acts to occuring. I don't think nations are great because of industrialization, it should be by the character of a nation by the way it treats humanity because we are all on this earth together. I think the connection between industrialization and imperialism is the domination of men ( white men) and with this domination there is a possibility that another Hitler might emerge.

===message:First of all, unemployment today is not due to industrialization. It is due to laziness and dependence on the government. There are plenty of jobs out there and anyone who wants to can find work. As far as domination of "white men" and the possibility of another Hitler, I must disagree. How could you even say that? The white race is not a dominant race. Many other races have arisen which has created a multi-cultural society and most people are comfortable with it. It is what has made America what it is today.

===message:MS. Turner I feel your pain and you have all the right in the world to express it the way you did.  I can truly relate to what you are saying.  I would compare it to the small country town that I come from.  We as children did not care nor did we know about a lot of the things that existed during the same time frame in Atlanta.  Our life was simple and very complete.  The industrial revolution has had massive affects on the world that we live in but contrary to poplular belief.  A lot of people have and still do survive on the basics.  Though shunned on because of the I need it now attitude.  The are just as happy with thier horse and buggy as we are in our fancy cars.  It is all based on your perspective and how you and only you view your needs and happiness.

===message:I could agree with your basic sentiments until the final comment on the connection of industrialization to imperialism to white men and the possible emergence of another Hitler.
<p>
First, imperialism was not just limited to the white man. Japan was an imperialist power. Like the Germans, they believed in the superiority of their race. In fact they are still one of the most racially pure societies today. 
I am not so sure I would define Hitler's Germany fitting the classic definition of an imperialist power. Yes, they used industrialization to mass-produce armaments to dominate the world with their Aryan master race. This master race exterminated Jews, Russians, Poles, Czechs, and others that would be considered white. The strict definition of an Aryan excluded most of the white population of the planet. 
<p>
Slavery and other atrocities against humanity are not limited to the white man against darker skinned races. Historically white men have made slaves of other whites and committed atrocities against all races. 
<p>
Blacks have made slaves of other blacks and the modern day atrocities committed by black African against black African are as brutal as any in history. Many Africans sold into slavery to the Americas was done so by rival African tribes. 
<p>
The latest historical example of the use of industrialization for imperial expansion was Saddam Hussein trying to control and exert influence over the Arab world. His regime was arguably responsible for the deaths of more Arabs (Muslims) than any in history.

Sadly, the rest of humanity greedily shares the motivations you attribute to whites.

===message:I would have to agree with you.  McDonald's is not the greatest place to work but a job is a job and it shows that you are not too good to work in that arena of work.  People have become complacent and wanting everything handed to them.  Being lazy won't get you anywhere.  The lazy folks are the ones at home complaining about not having anything.
