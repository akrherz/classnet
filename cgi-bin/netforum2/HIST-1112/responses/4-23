===message:I agree that we have far more advantages today than we did 100 years ago, but at what cost?  I think that we have become a spoiled society.  I do agree that we should use all the resources that own modern society has afforded us, but at the same time I think that some of these very nuances have made us a very lazy society.  We are always waiting for the technology to do something for us.  We can't even get up and turn the television to a different channel, but will tear the house apart looking for batteries.  What used to considered a labor intensive job even fifty years ago can be done with the flip of a switch.  And we wonder why our kids are becoming morbidly overweight.
