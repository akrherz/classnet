===message:I guess you would have to define beneficial.  Along with the innocence that the US portrays with that comes a lot of evil.  The US places its will on people  that I agree with but is it always the best thing for that particular country.  The time that it takes to rebuild a country to the specifications of the US would take as long as it has taken the US to get where it is.  Is it fair or better HELL no!.  Case and point.  In Iraq under SADAAM thier was no prostitution.  But now prostitute run the streets.  So my point is what you gain on one end you lose on the other.  Now what is next we will import prostitutes now you have AIDS in a country that has no AIDS at all.  So my point is that sometimes we need to leave things along.  NOw I am sure the next comment will be OH he was killing his people and the tortures and the MASS graves.  But if you remember we have had the same over here.  We had the the Sephilis experiments.  We had the use of Drugs in the Black neighborhood that unfortunately made its way into suburban American.  But no countrie came and forced thier beliefs on us.  My point is we just see the good that America Democracy brings to a region but I would be willing to say that for every good dollar made thier is 100 dollars made that is corrupt and bad.

===message:You're probably right, but the US has done alot of good for other countries. Maybe that is all we see. I'm sure there are alot of bad issues, but who's to say the US caused them? They could have been there all along.

===message:No one makes a person take drugs. That is free choice and most people are not going to spend there money to force someone to take drugs. They might give it to a person for a while hoping they will get hooked on it but just because you are given something doesn’t mean you have to take it. As for prostitution that is a victimless crime most of the time. The trafficking in people, “kidnapping“, and slavery are outlawed in every country in the world so if so if the victims would come forward that would make prostitution a choice between 2 consenting adults. Al you would not want to take someone’s free choice away would you?

===message:Sir if you are the same ae as I then you well know of the drug intoduction.  It was not based on free choice.  It was flooded into the environment by force.  As for prostitution if you was in Germany then I know you took a visit down to the Walk Plats.  This you know is totally differernt from what we see in the US.  And what I was refering too is that in some cases the greater evil can be change!
