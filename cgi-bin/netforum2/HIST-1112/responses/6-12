===message:Well I can agree but more disagree.  All the wars though they did not have CNN was seen as brutal.  I think with this war what you are missing is the power of the inventions.  This war brought many new weapons and inventions that glamortized the war.  It made friend or foe a mighter power which resulted in early confidence.  Most wars like the war we just encountered.  The reason why so many were behind it was that we knew that we were so superior.  But as we have found of late that superriority and domination does not stop the will of the oppressed.  This is not in war but in a lot of things.  I feel that they were so interested in starting another war not because of the reward but because of the might.  Also Nationalism was now alive and kicking.  Napoleon showed the world something that had never been seen before.
