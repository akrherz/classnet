===message:Do you really believe what you replied.  I think that all wars were devestating to the people and the soldiers.  I dont think that anyone ever learns to cope with war as if it was a sore or something.  I think that because of the vast travel and weaponery civilians really start seeing the power involved in WAR.  When it used to be more like one on one combat now a machine gun could kill hundreds of men with only one person behind the trigger.  War has always evolved as the text shows us so I really think that like the 70's to now the population grows with the time even with war.  Just think in 20 years our children will look at the invasion of IRAQ like we look at World War I..  They will ask the question why?
