What are you saying based on these statements, "The leaders of these deprived countries try to put their own fault on America. The relationship between the US and the Islamic world is that we are always having conflicts with each other. These conflicts come from America’s ambition to stay at the top"

Are we (US) not the blame or are we the blame (based on your last statement). Which position do you hold? I am a bit confused?  Thanks.

Most of the Islamic countries were established under certain dictartorship and rulers that imposed a way of life for many years.  The people in these countries were raised under these believes and loyaties.  As the US gains popularity in every aspect, these countries fear their ways will conclude, so they promote heatriate towads the US amongs their people.
