===message:I agree with you that America is on top but all you have to do is look at history <which we should be doing seeing as that this is a history class> to see that any nation on top never stays there. I'm not trying to preach doom but just reality. It could be 300 years before we "fall." Even then it doesn't have to be a fall it could be as with Britian; not the focus of the world anymore but not exactly totally out of the limelight. I'm only saying this because I feel that our studying history should make us more cautious to think that anything will stay the same forever. <pardon all spelling errors ... it's late at night>

===message:I agree with your view on the subject. (We)Americans have a lot to be proud of and have a lot to take full credit for. I feel that other countries mimic our styles, our looks, and our music. We are a very influential and powerful country. We are the #1 trend setter and other countries look to the US for trends,music, and latest fashions. It goes back to the USA as being a very dominating and influential country. It is good to be living in the USA. Wouldn't you agree?
