===message:     I agree that the Europeans benefited the most from Columbian exchange in the beginning, but I think that America and Mexico also benefited a great deal from the exchange. The European investors and explorers risked a great deal of money, time and energy in the risky business of trade with far off lands. The trade off was that it was also very profitable for them if successful. The new sources of crops and animals increased there wealth and there status in the “Old World”.
     In exchange the “New World”, especially America and Mexico, got things like horses and cattle. Those are just a couple of the gifts that America and Mexico received but I think they are the most important gifts because they played a major role in the history of our two countries. What would America or Mexico be like without the horse to help expand our population or the cattle that fed the population?
     Another important gift America received from Europe is there ideas and philosophies that came over with the explorers.  Most of our laws and culture came from Europe but I think the idea of freedom and equality came from the spirit of the explorer. This added to the vast amount of land available led to the creation of our great nation and the contributions we have contributed to the world.

===message:I agree that the Europeans benefited the most from the Columbian Exchange. Because of their efforts to explore the world's waters, they were able to trade with several countries. The Europeans were able to set up trading posts at key locations, thus resulting in an economic boost for their country. In addition, the Europeans experienced a growth in population due to the increased food supplies and better diets provided by American food crops.

The most important gift from Americans were the American food crops which contributed to better nutrition for Eurasian diets, as well as, cure famine that plagued the Old World for centuries. The potato itself saved may people from the brink of starvation. Before Europeans started eating American food crops, their poor diets exposed them to many diseases and plagues. The nutrition provided by American food crop allowed Europeans to build resistance to deadly diseases.

The most important gift to Americans was wheat and cattle. These items increased the American supply of food and animal energy.

===message:Thier is no doubt who benefited from the Columbian Exchange but did the benefit justify the means.  Now I guess one would say look at the world today.  But look at what the world could have been if entire civilizattion would not have been almost ended.
