===message:I agree with you that people's lives are better off today because of the industrialization.  Over the past 100 years, many areas of expertise have emerged thanks to new discoveries in science and technology.  This has given humanity better understandings of our own world, including science, medicine, and knowledge.  The industrialization was the gateway that led to scientific inventions that have greatly aided us.  The negitive aspect of the industrialization regaurding the family unit is sad, but true.  Today, the adults raise the children and the grow up, go to college and move on.  The extended family is growing more and more apart in most people's lives.  The industrialization has definately played a role in making our lives more independent of our other family members.
