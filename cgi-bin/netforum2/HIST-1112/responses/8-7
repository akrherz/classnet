===message:Due to the will to survive and conquer all, many new tactics were created. The Blitzkrieg and the Kamakaze were two very destructive ones. I do agree that Hitler was responsible for many deaths during the war, more than humanly imaginable. Germany was a vicious country.

===message:I agree that Germany was a vicious power.  I would also like to include Japan in on that.  The Japanese did things to the people of the Pacific Islands and other captured territories that are beyond our imagination.  While Germany was killing the Jews in Germany, Japan was savagly taking over one island at a time.  They forced Korean women into prostitution and justifed it as gift from the emperor.  The Japanese weren't as squeaky clean as many would like to think.  I feel sorry for Nagasaki, but I also feel sorry for the people that were sacrified for the emporer and for the expansion of the Japanese empire.

===message:<p>The “good” war, defending freedom of the nations and battling against the evils of that time, is a good way of explaining WWII.  Those few words pretty much explain why WWII could be considered the “good” war.  I too believe that Germany played a huge role in this war and had no consideration for its conquered lands or oppressed people groups.  The holocaust is enough to make anyone’s stomach cringe at the though of how people were abused, mutilated, and murdered.  The German people of this time had no remorse and forcefully took away land from other nations.  The forced and difficult labor of the conquered people also points out the oppression and evil that the Nazi regime incorporated.</p>
<p>The Japanese people of this time of war also get some credit towards these remarks.  Launching territorial invasions into China is just one demonstration on how little they valued their neighboring country.  The bombings and Rape of Nanjing also suggest how brutal these attacks were.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons, there were nations during WWII, who sought territorial conquests and industrial gain.  We can say that this was the “good” war though, because other powerful nations eventually stepped in and took a stand for these oppressed people and nations.  Once Germany crossed the line with Poland, Britain and France had no choice but to intervene.  Thankfully there were nations of that time who were willing to sacrifice their own time, money, and lives, to ensure the stability and peace of the world.  I can not really say that any conflict with loss of life is good.  Although, with these considerations and circumstances, we can see how good intentions were brought into fighting the conflicts, bringing an end to oppression and war.</p>

===message:Well said!  This, along with your previous posting, really captures the similarities and differences of these wars, the level of destruction, and the sentiments that would inspire anyone to consider this the "good war".  Also your comments on the different outcomes for Germany at the end of each war is so thought provoking.  Considering the level of insult they felt at being obligated to pay reparations after WWI, how ironic that the loss of WWII would result in a much more humiliating result- division of territorial control.

===message:My sentiments alike! When reading about the holocaust and the like of the brutalities of Japan in China, I can not for the life of me believe how people can take the liberties to destroy and demoralize the fellow man. I once asked a fellow employer who is Jewish if he had any relatives in the holocaust. His reply was, "What do you think? It was over six million killed." I guess he was saying figure the odds!

===message:Germany was an in humane country during Hitler's time. I do agree that the more advanced in technology we became the more we attempted to conquer the opposing nation. The wars that have been fought have been distructive and that is evident in the Blitzkrieg and the Kamakaze.Does it appear that we are creating more weapons and machinery to support war? Or just accepting the war and its destruction to a nation?
