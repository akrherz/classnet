===message:Sorry Ms. Williams I know that art is seen through the eye of the viewer but I think you missed this one.  I truly don't feel that people had a lot of time on thier hands so they turned to art.  I think the artist and only the artist used thier talent as a way to display thier feelings.  I feel that in this chaotic period you still were able to find a lot of art that was not an expression of the times.

===message:Hmmmm. Interesting perception. But I think that there was a strong reason why the artist painted what they painted during those turbulent times. In my opinion, (not to say that you are incorrect), that artist, many of them paint reflections of life and times surrounding them. Many  imitate life and tell stories their works life. They are a "silent voice" for us. But especially, I think if you analyze the art of the "that particular era", there were strong messages that were indicative of their paintings. The photographies, the art, the poetry, the writings, etc. etc. etc. All seemed to fall in line with a resounding message that reflected the voice and faces of the people and their societies.
