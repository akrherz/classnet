===message:I agree that some women wear cloth that get them and men into trouble. I don’t know that it is more inappropriate but I do know it has caused some men to do things they would not have done otherwise. I have to disagree with you about what women in other country’s wear. I spent some time in France where it is not uncommon to see a woman sun bathing on the beach or in her yard with nothing on but bikini bottoms. I also remember some of the women that I saw in Germany, were prostitution is legal, and what they wore to entice men to spend money in there shops.

===message:I don't think that all countries see America as being a corrupt society that excepts bad for good.  Many countries, just like Americans value their opinion highly and express this opinion through hating what they can't have....Americanization.  You mentioned clothing that was more appropriate......what is appropriate?  I have been to many places and seen clothing that I would not deem appropriate but that is my opinion, and believe it or not it has been far worse than what I have seen at the local Americanized mall.  OH and by the way I have friend that have come from those countries that you might deem as wearing appropriate clothing, who at the first chance that they can, loose that head to foot clothing and show of their beutiful bodies.

===message:Anthony, 
Not on the same page with you about the "other" countries wearing more appropriate clothing. I think you need to sit down a minute and watch a couple of documentaries, or a few National Geographic magazines where women's breast are hanging out, and men's "things" are all over the place. What countries are you talking about? Even in places like France, Spain, Germany, and especially all those beach areas...women hardly wear anything. And don't mention Brazil...phew! They are so provocative in fashion. So, take a few minutes and look around, but you'd better close your eyes! It is too revealing (to say the least).   

Yep. I do agree with Mr. Paulsen that there is some clothing that gets men into trouble (as I am careful to say). However, the trouble is already in the man's heart. Whether she has the clothes on or not, doesn't matter for that man. He has probably created that lustful picture already in his mind. Just a thought!

On another note, look at many women in America now a days. Clothing? Hmmm. What clothing? Just take a walk in the malls. There is more clothing now a day on manikins than the actual woman! Unfortunately, what is appropriate and inappropriate has been confused, diluted, and lost! Fortunately, for me I base my standards on what the Bible considers as modest adornment.

===message:With the subject on clothing, I thought I would throw in my opinion. I would have to agree with everyone on who's to say what clothing is or is not appropriate? If it weren't for Adam and Eve, it wouldn't be an issue. We wouldn't have to wear clothing at all. Just a thought.

===message:Well I guess so if that is the main point that you would like to make.  But I would like to add everyone does not particular want Western Views.  What ever happened to the thing called culture.  It used to mean something.  We celebrate Presidents day and every other stupid day it is in the book.  But what type of culture does America really have that is special.  Upon traveling abroad I say that yes our influence is very  obvious but looks so out of place in the spectrum of the country.  For example a McDonalds.  It looks so out of place in a country like Europe with its PUBS and history all around it then you see the Golden Arches and truly the only reason we go in is because we trust that we are eating hamburger and french fries.  It is familiar ground.  Then why cant the other countries have the right to keep thier familiar ground.

===message:Freedom - that's what its all about.  Who's to say what is appropriate or inappropriate?  Just be glad we have the freedom and the right to decide for ourselves what we want to wear.  I, too, traveled and while I was in Saudi Arabia we would go down town and have to be covered up (except for our faces).  You want to talk about degrading.  We are over there protecting the citizens of that country and they decipher what we can wear.  It was over 100 degrees and I was wishing for barely wearing anything. (and I don't dress scantily).  So I appreciate the fact that I have the freedom of deciding what to wear, those women don't have the freedom for much of anything much less being able to decide what to wear.

===message:Anthony, I also agree that technology has a major role to play in driving our influence in the world today.  With the aid of computer communications, information is sent in a matter of seconds.  I think the book also makes a good point stated that English is becoming a primary language of global communications.  The mere fact that we even have a presence on the Internet pronounces influence.  If the U.S.’s views, cultures, and values are out on the Internet for anyone to access, there is little to stop that information from being seen by people across the globe.
   <p>Television is another way to let other people see how our culture is.  This allows anyone to see a picture (even if it is false) of the United States.  If other nations have televisions and see what the Americans have to offer, this can give these nations good or poor feedback about our nation.  
   <p>With the advent of technology the American society can advertise and promote any products or values electronically.  The reason this is so powerful is because every nation in the world does not have the materials to do so.  This is probably one good reason why some nations are afraid of the U.S. and its concepts.  If we as Americans were receiving bits of information all the time, but not able to respond, we would feel bombarded as well.  However a country might respond to the U.S. and its use of technology, there is no changing the fact that technology will become more and more useful and influential as our lives progress.
