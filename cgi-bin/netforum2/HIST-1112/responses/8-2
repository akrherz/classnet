===message:I thought you had great observations and agree with all with the exception that I thought that both wars did have similarities in their origins.  WWII began with countries not agreeing with the treaties that were set up after  WWI.  They were wanting revisions to many of the peace settlements that concluded after the first war.  It seems like it was just a carry-over.
<p>
Just my opinion.
