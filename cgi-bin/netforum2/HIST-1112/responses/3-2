===message:     I have to agree with Anthony that conservatism seems to have had the most effect in American Society.  I don’t believe that it has had the most lasting effect in a world view. I think anti-Semitic and Zionism has had a bigger impact on the world as a whole. I think if you look at the problems caused by Anti-Semitism you will see that it has caused more deaths in the last hundred years than conservatism has caused in the last thousand years. Both are discrimination against individuals because of things out of there control. 
     Zionism is a people trying to get a nation of there own, the problem with that is the nation they want has belonged to another people for many years. With the discovery of weapons that can kill millions of people or destroy the world completely, I think this will have
longer lasting repercussions.

===message:I would have to challenge your comment on women being undermined and underpaid next to males. Many women today make considerably more than men. There are also many women who have taken a role in what was once cosidered a "man's job" and are doing just as well if not better than some of them. Women are also very active in politics and who knows, maybe one day one of them will run for President.:)

===message:I have to agree with you that conservatism has had a greater impact on American society than any other.  It has taken decades for some views and preferences in the American culture to change over time.  One of these issues in America was the rights on voting.  It took hundreds of years for the entire adult population over the age of 18 to legally vote.  The ideal of conservatism held on the old views and traditions which didn't let younger people, women, or minorities the right to vote.  Overtime though, these people pressed there way into freely voicing their opinions and voting.  This is just one example of conservatism in the US.  I believe that other issues are strongly tied with conservatism and if it is highly looked in favor upon, it will take much effort to change the ways people think on certain ideals.  This has everything to do with American conservitism and why it is so powerful today.
