===message:I agree with you, The Great War was mudering and slaughtering of young innocent soldiers and for what reason? What did this accomplished? It seemes to me that the people had no idea of the consequence of this war. It was brutal, and it was terrible. The military and the government in my opinion are always at war among one another when it comes to fighting and preserving the lives of innocent people. Wilson's obstacle in my opinion would have been an excellent idea for those that were against the war. There are a lot of different things that as a whole could have made our economy a better place. Absolute freedom of navigation over the seas is one. In my opininon and I quote a verse from the late Marvin Gaye, "War is not the answer" If we as a country as a whole can get to the route of the problem than we can provide soulutions not war.
