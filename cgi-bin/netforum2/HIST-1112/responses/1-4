===message:You made some really good points that I totally agree with.  When you look at the big picture, hundreds of years later it is easier to see the benefits that were gained.

===message:None of these "benefits" actually benefitted the indigenous peoples who lived here before Europeans arrived. Native American populations have never recovered from the ravages of disease and conflict. Whereas indigenous cultures in America were nomadic, roaming all over the land, Europeans settled the land and eventually made it impossible for the natives to maintain their hunting and gathering lifestyles. "If it were not for migration to the Americas then this part of the world could still be unsettled and even unknown" ignores the fact that this part of the world was in fact populated by millions of people before the Europeans arrived. What looked like unsettled and unused lands to the English were in fact hunting grounds. For all these reasons I would argue that migration in fact did not benefit Americans at all. Europeans were the beneficiaries, to the detriment of native Americans across the hemisphere.

===message:     I agree with Laura that the indigenous peoples of America suffered a great deal by the plagues brought over by the Europeans but I do not think that the Europeans purposely infected them with different diseases.  I believe that the Europeans way of life was more productive in the use of land. I think that the American Indians way of life was not as well suited for future growth as was the Europeans. 
     The American Indians way of life was mostly based on hunting with very little farming. The European way of life was to farm and it takes a lot less land to feed one family when you are farming than it does when you are hunting for game. Farming also takes a lot less time and energy than does hunting, this allows more time to be put into planning for the future and less time spent chasing game from place to place.
    Personally I think both peoples benefited about the same from the exchange but at the time of  the Columbian Exchange the people of Europe benefited the most. They also were the ones who knew they were risking something.

===message:<p>Most of my comments on benefits relate to any American person living in the American land at the time.  Many of the people living here in America, an ocean away from Europe, probably didn’t consider themselves European, except the diehard loyalties.  If the majority of the population did consider themselves to be European, then during the mid-1760’s the American colonists would not have wanted independence from British rule (Bentley 810).</p>
<p>I know Europeans gained a lot in terms of trade and food supply.  They certainly put in every ounce of effort to get the American colonization started, since any American colonist in that time, probably came from an European country.  My main focus on migration is the basis on how all of the American countries formed into what they are today.  The English, French and Spanish all contributed in one way or another.  Eventually, these people that came to the Americas became independent of their European counterparts, and had to consider themselves American in one fashion or another.  So these are the people I would say benefited most from the Columbian Exchange.  Not just the Indian people of America, but all Americans.  The people who came over to America that gave up their previously known lives and to take on the challenges of a new world.</p>

===message:If we are talking about migration being beneficial to the Indians, maybe not. But, they were not strong enough to manage the land on their own. I would have to say that the Americans definately benefited from migration. Due to the many settlements in America, it became stronger and more established which contributed to it's success.

===message:I really dont understand how you can just paint a picture of total good with the Columbian Exchange.  Many races were totally wiped out for the sake of America.  Yes this is the melting pot but the early arrivers was not as willing as the now imgrants.  Many were taken against thier will and if not killed in the process.  America is great but it was truly built by the blood and lives of people who were not from america and what did America give back to these areas.  NOTHING!

===message: The indigenous people did not benefit from the Columbian Exchange and there were a lot of resources to benefit from. If there were anyone who benefited the most initially from the Columbian Exchange would be the Eurpeans. One may argue that the Americas were the most beneficial. Eurpeans were given the gifts and resources intially and they acquired their resources first. The other groups received (if any) what was distributed to them by the Eurpeans. Now ask yourself if someone gave you a small portion of something would it be the same as giving you the whole portion?  The answer is no. Americas were not the one that benefited the most from the Columbian Exchange and other groups in my opinion such as the Africans and Asians did not benefit at all.
