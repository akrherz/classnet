===message:Why do you say they turned to alcohol in order to cope? Although this may have been true for some, this was not the solution for many. Many turned to their loved ones for support in dealing with their feelings while others just could not cope at all.

===message: I was not there to see how they coped, but to say that many chose alcohol to cope is a little broad; however, each is entitled to his/her own opinion.

===message:I, too, agree that to say they dealt with the war with alcohol is way too broad a view.  I think there were so many other ways to deal with it; for instance, family, suicide, depression (to where they can't deal with it), literal insanity, and I'm sure a list of other things.  Who's to say, we weren't there.

===message:Hey dude I have to come to your defense.  I understand where the ladies are coming from but they have to admit that alcoholism was one of the great cope with medicine of the time.  It was not the only thing but it was one of the top 3.  Yes many did turn to families but after turning to thier families once everyone went to sleep they turned to the bottle.  And women were not excluded from this.  Just like many would agree that this was a barbaric war I kinda disagree.  This war was a new era in war machines, tactics and warfare.  This war changed the war field because of the total distruction weaponery.   This war just was another stepping stone in the inventions of the weapon.  Just think now we have laser guided missles that can get under a bridge and blow up a tank but the bridge remains in tact.  During the Great War the bridge was blown to smitherings with the tank.  But Ladies you got to keep it real a lot of alcholics came out of this war just like in Vietnam a lot of Dope heads came out.  Not to say all of them was in either war but you got to acknowledge it cause it was true.

===message:Not sure about the alcohol being a major source of coping. I guess the bottle may have been easy to grab for some (smile), but art, music, writings by various authors, poetry, and religion were some of the vehicles that people expressed their despair and frustrations. These were outlets for many people to relieve disgust.
