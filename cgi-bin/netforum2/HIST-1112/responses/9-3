===message:I think one of the reasons that Communism did not work and that they had to use such brutal force to keep there people in utopia was that everyone is not going to get the job that they enjoy or do there best at it. Looking at it this way, if the government decided that your best skills were sewing and that you were going to spend the rest of your life working in a sweat shop making cloth and it did not mater what you wanted just what you were good at, would that make you satisfied with you job.

I would not say that the end of the cold war proves our way of life is better than Communism because if that was the true then everyone in Russia would have moved to a Capitalist country when the Berlin wall came down. You also have to take into account that there are communist organizations in America and other capitalist county’s. To say that “no one is trying to escape from the United States under threat of retribution” is not accurate because the U.S. government did stop people from immigrating to Russia during the cold war. McCarthyism is one example of what our government did to people that they thought might believe in Communism as a legitimate form of government.

===message:I couldn't agree more that the era of McCarthyism is an embarrassing blemish in our nation’s history.   At the same time, I don’t feel that one of the benefits of freedom should be allowing treason.  I say this without actually having any knowledge of the laws you speak of preventing U.S. citizens from moving out of the country....I don’t know what the reasons may have been that our government didn’t want certain individuals associating with the enemy.  Perhaps you know where I could get additional information on this subject?  I would love to know more.

===message:I think while both countries, US and USSR, both wanted thought that thier idea of government was a better way of freedom, they woth had valid points.  I dont think that they ment for a battle between comunisum and capitalism. They just knew that there government worked for them, so they thought freedom was best in their own way of government.
