===message:I totally agree with Jesse Caudill in that the Native Americans lost most from the Columbian Exchange and the gift to them was diseases. I also agree that the Americans gained the most from the Columbian Exchange. Although the Americans experienced some decline in population due to the spread of diseases, the long-term result was an increase in population from the spread of the crops and animals delivered from the Europeans. 
The most important gift from the Americas was the generosity to share their crops with other countries. The crops that took route in Africa, Asia and Europe included maize, potatoes, tomatoes, and peanuts (just to name a few). The results of the Americas' generosity were an increase in calories in Eurasian diet, and added protein, vitamins and zesty flavors to foods.

===message:Great response. I totally agree with you. America did profit the most from the Columbian Exchange. They may have profited even more if they could have compromised with the Native Americans and shared their skills and knowledge. Who knows what America may be like today if that had occurred.

===message:I feel that also the Africans were in the same boat as the Native Americans.  Though they were not ravaged with disease the became so misplaced in the world stretching from South America to the South.  I think that due to the nature of thier misplacement it would have been better to die fighting for the right to die than to be taken from your homeland sold into  bondage.  Yes you may argue that a population growth occured but look at the circumstances in which the population growth happened.

===message:I am sorry but I cannot agree with the notion of America gaining from the Columbian Exchange. As you stated the Native Americans obviously lost the most in the exchange. The Americans of today are mainly descendants of the Europeans that depleted the Native American societies. Therefore I look at them as Europeans still benefiting from the devastation and exploitation of the Americas. If the Americans had truly benefited there would be more Native Americans and other Indian tribes in the USA today.
