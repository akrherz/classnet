===message: Those who have power had to work hard to get where they are and deserve to maintain it. Those without power have every right to gain it. They just have to want it and work for it. It is not going to be given, it has to be earned. Anything is possible with a little determination and alot of hard work.

===message:I can agree with part of your characterization of conservatism. I don't necessarily agree with the statement that the conservatives in power are going to move us back decades. Before I go any further, let me state that I am neither conservative (Republican) nor liberal (Democrat). I consider myself a moderate and the party that I tend to agree with many of their ideals over the years is Libertarian, but they have their drawbacks, also, I am an Independent. I find the Republicans and Democrats equally distasteful.

I was very happy to see the liberals (Clintons) removed from power. I had about all I could take of the liberal "political correctness" that sought not equality but privileged status for the supposedly disenfranchised. Past liberal programs such as Affirmative Action were abused to the point that the "disenfranchised" considered it their right to have preference over other American citizens. All citizens should have equal political rights but not receive preferential treatment in situations where merit and skill are the basis for consideration.

All Americans have equal rights under the Constitution, but the recent political liberalism excluded the fundamental forgotten principle that each right carries with it certain responsibilities. Our most recent liberal leader "didn't inhale" and didn't consider "oral copulation" to be sex. His leadership example of avoiding responsibility still plagues this nation. Not that conservatives, such as Richard Nixon, didn't try to avoid responsibility, either. I just found the recent liberal leader to be particularly offensive. A few years of conservatism to offset the abuses of the recent liberals is OK with me right now.

Something interesting to note about our recent conservative and liberal leaders is that Clinton refused to sign the order for HIPAA...Bush did. HIPAA, among other things, protects the privacy of mental health (psychiatric) records. A measure good for ALL Americans.
