===message:Jesse,

I do agree when you say that "some people don't want to change." Some people are afraid of change and that becomes a barrier for new experiences. But, I don't agree when you say this, "I also believe that we should not force our government on any country. We should only influence other countries to want to become a country like ours".

Sounds contradictory...Then if we should not force ourselves....why should we "influence others...." Why don't we just leave others alone. If they want to hop the fence and live with us, then fine! But when you also say, "I believe many countries are stubborn and reject the idea that our way of government works"...Works? What works? What part of it works? That's your perception. There are many frustrated Americans that will say "it ain't working"!
Thanks for your thoughts!

===message:I love the sentiment in your posting.  What I get from this is that you think we should lead by example and that we should try to be a country that others would want to emulate.  The word ‘influence’ seems to have taken on a negative connotation in these discussions but I believe there is such a thing as a positive influence which is what we want to portray through freedom and prosperity.  I also agree with you that our government works for the most part.  Many of the ideas presented seem to indicate a high level of dissatisfaction with the U.S. system, however, I don’t see any ideas as to where a better place to live would be!  Great posting!
