===message:Imperialism was all about greed.  Who could control more of everything; people, industries, wealth, natural resources, territories, and just have total glory (934).  It wasn't about industrializing a nation and allowing its own people to run it, but others coming in and taking over.

<p>
In addition to the nationalism spawned in dominated countries in order to throw off the yoke of imperialism, a legacy of mistrust and hatred between nations, religions,  and ethnic groups is all too historically familiar. The familiar cry in Arab lands today is against the imperialism of the United States and Israel...a valid complaint in the past. Whether persent United States involvement in that part of the world is still imperialist in nature, or an evolved consciousness of equality and freedom from terrorism on a global scale has yet to be judged by history. The current issues facing that area of the world are most certainly the result of the imperialist policies of multiple nations. The legacy of violence and terrorism may remain for quite some time.
<p>
Almost all the wars in the last 200 years have been about nations trying to impose imperialist policies or throwing off the yoke of imperialism. Using the definition of imperialism from the discussion question then I would have to state that there is no justification for imperialism.

===message:I must say that you make an excellent point. Although imperialism brought about great nations, it wasn't in the best interest of that nations people. Imperialism was a result of greed and power hungry people who were only interested in domination and exploitation. They did not consider the wants or needs of the people they were controlling. At least not in most cases.

===message:I have to disagree with you on "Imperialism was all about greed."  I think that greed had something to do with it, but I also think that Imperialism had something to do with Social Darwinism.  "The strongest will survive."  Countries that were weak and unable to protect themselves from outsiders were taken over and used for their valuable resources.  You have to ask yourself this question also, are they better off now with all the advancements that have been introduced to them or before when they were underdeveloped, undereducated and not advanced enough to utalize their own resources?

===message:"Underdeveloped and undereducated" by whose standards? It is impossible to speculate how countries might have developed differently had they not come under imperial domination. Whence comes this idea that an agricultural or nomadic society is necessarily inferior? It is the ancient myth that those in power make the rules but need not abide them, that the winners write history, that "might makes right."

===message:<p>I agree with you Ramon that a major drive for Imperialism was the domination and exploitation of the colonies recourses.  We read a small section on Religion and Political reasons, buy it is evident that most European powers had economic priorities in other lands.  An example of this was when Britain took control of India during the Mughal states declination.  The British had no intention of reviving the local governments there, but creating their own presence of government, all in the interests of trade and spices.  Another example is the British's transformation of Ceylon from a rain forest to a tea producing colony.  What is most noticeable is that they recruited Ceylonese women to handle the labor intensive work here.  It is only my speculation here, but I doubt these women wanted to live their lives in this area of work.  Both of these actions of Britain suggest that their primary interest was in the economic gain of that land area.</p>
<p>There is not a justifiable way to say Imperialism was right.  Many people died during war for these lands, so it is difficult to explain how any Country is just in oppressing another nation.  Most of these countries have gained their freedom today, but only after centuries of oppression and suffering of their past people.  It is true that history has revolved around issues of imperialism.  The greater country will try to get what it wants from a lesser nation, even by the means of force and war.</p>

===message:I think that you may have misunderstood what I was trying to say.  When I say Undereducated or underdeveloped I am refering to what Diane Mercer said in her response that they just didn't know what they had until it was given to them.  I have been to islands in the Pacific that have been given the opputunity to learn how to use the land they live on, but they are still living in a downward spiral of poverty.  I do not think that an argicultural socirty is inferior, without this society we wouldn't survive.

===message:I mainly agree with what you have stated. Imperalism has been a continuing battle with smaller countries that have struggled to break free from hierarchy rule. Although I do not condone Imperalism, I do believe that the only way to find reason in Imperalism is to envision history without it. Without the arise of imperalism, many countries would not posses the independence that they embrace today.

===message:I agree with your statement that there are no justification for imperalism. The term was orginally defined as the domination of European powers-and later United States and Japan as well. Imperalism can also be traced to some of the  major wars and conflicts. Imperalism alone means  "dominance." Dominance can involve a lot of things such as power, money, respect,industralization, and resources. I do not agree with this form of government. Imperalism in my opinion is about power and control. There should be no form of government that have control over an individual's freedom or ideas. This is why imperalism will never prevail. It will never be justifiable because under imperalism power will be the primary goal and the people will be controlled and ruled. Now ask yourself would you like to be ruled or controlled?
