===message:I have to disagree with some of your statements Anthony, 1st I don’t think it is only the U.S. that has a history of taking war to new heights I think that is just the nature of war. War stated out as just 2 people fighting over something and then one picked up a stick or rock and it has continued to escalate from there. 2nd As for the Japanese I still don’t know if it was politics that started that war or if the Japanese were retaliating against us when they bombed Peril Harbor but I do know that they helped make the decision to drop the Atomic bomb when they decided to use Kamikazes against us.

I personally am a Christian and I understand that my religion tells us to go and spread the word.  I also know that this is unwise, in some if not most circumstances, but there will always be those that take everything to the extreme. I have to agree that if they don’t want our religion in there country we should not try and force it on them, after all, it is there country not ours.

===message:WOW Anthony I respect your view as an American to express you freedom of opinion, but don't you think that you are being somewhat narrow minded about your views on OUR Country?  I don't believe that the United States is impossing on other nations, I think that the United States along with other countries would like to see a more democratic society vs communism.  You mentioned that the United States has a history of taking over indengenous people in other countries and doing evil things to them.  Let us not forget the horrors of Hitler, Hussain and Bin Laden.  You mentioned the Atomic Bombs that were dropped on Japan....Let us not forget in our history lessons that the Atomic Bombs that were dropped on Japan were assembled on the tiny island of Tinian in the Pacific ocean that was taken over by Japanese forces who might I add tortured and forced the indigenous people into forced labor.  The Atomic Bomb if you might remember was dropped on Japan to hopefully avoid a long and bloody land battle that would have risked so many more American lives.  On the note of religion.....The United States is not the only country out their that is trying to spread their religious views.  If you have the opportunity to travel to other countries you will find that Christianity is wide spread and excepted but there are many other religions that are also choosen.  If the Islamic know quite well about Imperialism then maybe they should take a step back and look at the views that they are trying to spread throughout the world now.

===message:It is shocking to see your negativity towards the United States. The US was not the only nation guilty of imposing itself on other nations. Many other nations provoked war and killed many Americans in the process. Each nation did what it had to survive.

===message:<p>I agree with everything you have stated Anthony. The simple fact is that Americans are naïve to the fact that their country has and continues to try to spread its influence where it is not wanted. However, in order to realize this you have to be on the outside looking in. I would not expect an American to acknowledge that this still occurs, but I bet if he or she was in the shoes of someone from a smaller country he or she would understand. For instance an American would not know that the American government threatened the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) because it did not support the War on Iraq. America still feels the need to impose itself on other nations.</p>
