===message:I love the humanistic approach you took.  I really agree with your reply.  It is very much like I feel from a humanistic approach.  I totally agree that we will never live in a world without a major conflict going on somewhere.  Not saying that we will always know that its going on.  I truly believe as long as thier is someone out thier we will find a reason to attack them.  Unfortunately many do not agree with me when I say sometimes people dont have to be like us to be excepted by us.  But this democracy movement that is spreading around the world does not work for all and the world should realize it.  What is good for the goose is not always good for the gander.

===message:I can say amen to that too Al. I think the reason that we as a nation might be so disliked by others is that we are so eager to force our ways of thinking and life styles on others whereby it becomes overbearing and to say the least, they don't want to live like us! It is funny (and ironic) that our country is pluralistic society. But we in turn are always seemingly still forcing others to pattern themselves like us. Isn't it OK to be different?
