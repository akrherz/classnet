===message:<p>I am not sure if military and political leaders saw the war as a great lost. The members of the Central Powers probably saw it that way but I am sure that the Allies were satisfied with the results of the war. The Allies were able to reduce the rising economic and military power of Germany and the eagerness shown by them signing the Treaty of Versailles was a testament to this. The reduction of the German empire was more important to the Allies than the 250,000 British, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealander lives that were lost at the battle of Gallipoli.</p>

===message:I agree with you Ramon, that the Allied leaders were probably satisfied with the results of the war.  Nothing less than winning and success is satisfying in situations like these.  When I was referring to the leaders of the nations seeing war as a great loss, I was speaking of the never before seen masses of death.  The economic decline of the nations leading to the Great Depression had to be another ill effect that the war brought.  The Allied nations of Britain and France were both highly in debt to the United States by the end of the war.  With any political leader the economy is a big issue, so this poor state of the nation had to be of some failure due to war.  I do agree with you though that the Allies were satisfied with the results of the war.  I still think though that aside from their success, there was also great loss among all nations involved and affiliated with WWI.

===message:You are right Jordan. The war was a great loss for many nations. In earlier history, the US was quite familiar with being a debtor to others, now the tide had turned. Europe now was in debt to the US making the US a creditor nation. That war had ushered in some of the most massive losses in life and finances throughout the world.
