===message:Sorry, I think you missed it.  The American Revolution was not the catalyst of Revolutions.  Thier were other significant revolution that came befor the American Revolution that set the tone for the American Revolution.  The most prominent advocate of political equality was the French Swiss thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau.  I do agree than the American Revolution is and will always be very important for American civilization today.

===message:Ramon, I absolutely agree with your explanation of contractual government.  And yes, America did set a standard by which many other nations followed.  They inspired the call to freedom.  John Locke, as well as many other philosophes, set a foundation of radical thought that was new and innovative and all inclusive.  The concept of the people actually having the upper hand was inconceiveable.
