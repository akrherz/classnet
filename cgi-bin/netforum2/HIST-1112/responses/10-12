===message:Excellent job!  I totally agree with you.  I enjoyed the last paragraph.  We do need to stand behind our leaders, no matter the situation.  How much better would we be if we ALWAYS stood by and watched?  You're so right, sometimes we have to do something.  You go girl!!!!!!!

===message:Lesa, I agree with most of what you said but I just can’t bring myself to trust our government completely. Some of the things our leadership has done in the past and the lies they have told to keep its citizens from finding out has caused this distrust. I think you are right that we should not just stand by and do nothing but we should also not follow our leaders blindly.

===message:I definitely see your point. I guess I feel that once I've educated myself on political candidates, made my choice and voted, all I can do at that point is try to stay informed and communicate with my representatives whenever I feel necessary.  I know I'll never take the time and effort to know all I can about every issue (laziness on my part I guess) so I attempt to elect the best possible people and try to let the system work.  My limitations in this area are self imposed so I can't complain too much but I do feel confident in our current leadership.  I've certainly been let down and disappointed by the government as we all have.  Another reason your point is so valid is that I think our system benefits from some of our leaders knowing we aren't blindly following them.
