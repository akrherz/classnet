===message:<p>Your explanation for why the extreme political philosophies became popular is right on point. I never looked at if from the point of view that democracy appeared to be inefficient to the people. Who could fault the people for following the charismatic leaders that were offering a better life? These leaders just took advantage of people in dire need of change to implement their radical beliefs.</p>

===message:Thank you Ramon!  I don't typically try to find excuses as to why people cannot seem to overcome normal adversities... but I can only try to imagine living in such hopeless times as those.

===message:Lesa, you summed it up quite well. Your comment "As revolutions in physics and psychology took place artists sought ways to capture the ideas that photographs could not..." I think you are right on target. There is a place for cameras but cameras could never replace paintings. 

I think the people were just desperate for change. But again I must caution that when you are in that "state" you become vulnerable.    

Ramon, right on with your comments!
