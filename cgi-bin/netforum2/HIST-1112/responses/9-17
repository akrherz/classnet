===message:OK Jasmine,

Some good points, but you have to qualify this statement when you say..."Basically, communist leaders are, and were, very selfish people. The communist leaders would not seek to better their country, but rather to better themselves."

Now doesn't that sound like some of the leaders and rich folks in the capitalistic ole' US of A??? Think about it! I think we (US) might have to eat a little crow at the same table of those "selfish communist leaders".

===message:That is a very good point Leon.  I have to agree that both sides during the Cold War had their own motives, whether selfish or sincere.  The basic truth is that both sides wanted to extent their communist or capitalistic systems to the other nations in the world.  This was attained greatly through the help of sending these other Nations, economic aid or military support.  I do believe that every nation has some form of selfish individuals somewhere in the system.  It just is a sad situation when these selfish desires affect the other people the nation or even in the world, as it did in the Cold War.
   <p>Good assessment Jasmine.  You make some good points to look upon.

===message:I totally agree with you about some of the people in this great ole USofA are selfish. I was saying that when the leaders make decisions, it would seem that they chose to do what was best for them , not the country. I do appreciate your reply. Thank you.
