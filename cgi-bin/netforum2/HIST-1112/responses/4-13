===message:I agree with you in regards to today's standard of living is better than they were a hundred years ago. I could not imagine riding down the highway and seeing horses and carriages. This is very unlikely but is was the way people lived a hundred years ago. Now lets fastforward in today's busy time and see how much advance and better off in living we are. Could you imagine driving down 285 with horses and a carriage? The obvious answer is "no" and is unheard of.Of course we are better off today. With time we must adhere to change. Change is good for everyone. There are a lot more opportunities for people to become succesful and not just be grouped in one particular class of people. For example. We have different class of people that are successful a wide variation, different age, different race, and different genders. As before only certain people were allowed to be successful. In otherwords, the opportunities now are more greater and equal in a sense. There are no restrictions on the young, old, middle age person being succesful. We all are given opportunities. 
 There are some room for improvement in this fast paced and changing society. For instance there should be more focus on family and children. There are so much time spent in obtaining and securing position, money, power and a career that education and children are not the primary area being focused on. This is negative and it should be improved.
