===message:  I think that in general people had a totally different outlook on war after WWI.  Soldiers had not seen the advanced weaponry and chemical warfare that was being used on the front lines.  Civilians were officially made targets of warfare under the New Rules of Engagement.  Military leaders were using blockades to deny food shipments to Military operations and civilians.  War can be a dirty affair.  
  I am sure that many people had a hard time coping with their feeling about war.  Many women that sent their husbands or fathers off to war joined the Home front to rally in support of those sent of to war.  They went to work in place of the men that had left.  More people rallied in support of the war effort than those that protested against it.  
	For those who were against the war, propaganda was their means of letting the public know about the horrors of war.  
	I do not believe that all wars are avoidable; there will always be some type of conflict between two countries/nations or societies.  There are to many people with to many different opinions who think that they are the only ones that are right.  I would like to believe that world peace could exist, but reality is the truth and we can try to make the world a better place, but whose to say that our reality is what is best or everyone.

===message:I strongly support everything you said. I particularly like what you said on how they coped with the war. The only thing they had was each other. Their loved ones were dying and many lost everyone they loved to the war. The only way to get through the war was to lean on someone for support. We today do the same thing. When we loose someone or something precious to us we need support. Either by counseling or other people that pull us up from the depression stages of our lives.
