===message:I agree with you about the statement of Superpower, but I don't think that we are universally despised and hated around the world.  I think that many people love to hate us because they would love to have what we have.  We are the fat kid in the candy store with the opportunity to get anything we want, other countries on the other hand are staring through the window in envy.  Ask yourself.....Do you hate that fat kid in the candy store or are you just a bit jeolous of what he has?

===message:Heather,

I have to jump in on this one. Hmmm....you say "fat kid". Think about it. "Fat" kid to me would mean greedy, selfish, stingy, glutton...Wouldn't you agree? Of course, I would be angry looking at the "fat kid" in the candy window, wondering if he/she will leave anything left for the rest of us. That's the problem. We have been the "fat kid" for the wrong reasons. It would not be a problem if we (US) were a "lean" kid though, huh? Too many people (other societies) see the US as a big "fat" bully. If there was some balance in our society economically, governmentally, politically, etc., I think that we might be able to experience a bit more enjoyable lives and many others would see us in a different perspective (not to mean that we would please all). But I think our image would improve.

Now don't get me wrong. I still  believe that the freedoms we are afforded (amongst the problems) go a long way and despite all the challenges we experience as an "economic stable" country are still inviting to other (folks) countries. But, the "fat kid" image is certainly something we need to work on! If we are to be a world leader in the eyes of the world, we would need to set the best example as a country of sincerity, justice, truth and love for our fellow man! We should only be "fat" because God has blessed us richly, not because we selfishly hoarded it!

===message:I must comment on your response to Heather. The US has worked very hard to achieve the society that it is today. The technology, medical breakthroughs, modern amenities, etc. were not "hoarded", they were earned.I also believe that the US is a great world leader who sets a great example for other countries. The US is constantly sending aid to help foreign countries unselfishly. I remember during all of the comflict with Afghanistan, George Bush requested that every citizen of the US donate one dollar to aid the children there. Do you call this selfish? I think we live quite enjoyable lives in this great country of the USA. If it were such a "bully", why do so many people from other countries want to live here and why would the USA let them?

===message:Okay so he doesn't have to be the "fat" kid in the candy store.  We can make him healthy and lean, but the point I am trying to make is not one of greed, selfish, stingy and glutton.  I am not the person to get angry at the kid in the candy store...I on the other hand try to think of ways that I can strive to be more like him and be able to choose the kind of candy that I want.  I don't think being the "fat" kid is a problem and I don't think we have been the "fat" kid for all the wrong reasons.  If you look at our history, we are the kid that gives away to much candy to other countries and still get blamed because we "didn't give enough." Your right by saying that we will never please everyone.  I still say the United States is not this "evil monster" that some people like to make us out to be.  If people hate the United States so much then why.....why....why are they still living in our counrty?????  I think that our image is fine and I still say "fat" or "lean" we are the kid in the candy store and the other countries are blurring their view of the United States by breating hard and fogging up the window to the candy store!!!!!

===message:Evidentally we hoarded the big "fat" can of worms you seem to have opened.  I think I'll have to join in on the band-wagon.  Consider how many countries call on the good ole U.S. when they are in trouble.  How many times have we had to go and "help out"?  How many organizations do we have that send food and money donations to help those other countries?  Bully or not - we're the ones they call on when somebody needs something.  Of course, we aren't perfect nor can we help everybody, but we do a great deal.  Take a look at how many immigrants we have coming to join our "melting pot".  If you come to our country for freedom you get it. It doesn't mean you'll have it all, but it does mean you've been given the opportunity to do with it what you may.  People every day risk their lives to get here.  As you say, if so many dislike us, why are they trying to get here?  And once they get here, they really don't have the right to complain.  It's kind of like voting; if you don't vote, you don't have the right complain about the president.  If they don't like it here, we don't make them sign a contract to stay.

===message:Ok. I am not saying that our country isn't "great" (with tongue in cheek), what I am saying is that US policy has not been the best...but a "mess"! I can feel comfortable in saying that a country such ours has not been the most honest "fat kids" on the block! 

Remember, we only hear and see what propaganda wants us to hear and see. I just wanted to rattle some cages and get some feedback on this. 

Yeah, we help others, but we also destroy the same people we have helped...and that's a fact!
