===message:I agree with your assessment of the paintings.  I too felt they represented confusion, and the changing of times.  I think the artist did an exceptional job displaying the attitudes during this time.

===message:<p>The paintings gave a sense of confusion that coincided with the confusion that could be found throughout the world during that period. That is what was so meaningful about the paintings; they reflected the reality of society.</p>

===message:Yvonne's comment made me think that there must be a continuous liberation in art due to the affects of war. Today their are numerous reflections of the tragedies that the current war has left behind found in the new arising art. The art that emerged from the Age of Anxiety created a catalyst that has enabled people to communicate human reality.
