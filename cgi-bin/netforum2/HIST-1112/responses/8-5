===message:I wonder if part of the tension was not planned to help bring cohesion and patriotism into the nations.   It seems to me this would be a great way to get people to work together against a common enemy. Governments could use the tension to convince people that they needed to sacrifice personally for the cause of capitalism or communism, depending on what side you were on.

===message:David that is an interesting thought.  I too wonder if this was planned.  At the Yalta Conference tensions started rising when Stalin ensured that the Red Army's presence would dictate the future of states liberated by the Soviets (pg 1063).  Because the United States and Britain wanted Stalin to help them in the war against Japan and to collaborate in the establishment of the United Nations, Roosevelt and Churchill gave into Stalin.  I felt like the war against Japan could have been won without the Russian alliance.  I am with you on the created tension.

===message:No Ms. Turner, I disagree. The alliances did remain the same but this war involved the entire World.  No one was safe from this war.  The accusation that this war was fought on 2 fronts is wrong .  This war was fought all over the world from the skies to the bottom of the ocean.
