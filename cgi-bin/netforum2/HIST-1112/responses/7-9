===message:I think you have a great assessment of the artwork.  I agree with you in that both styles of art were images of what the artist saw, be it a painting or a picture.  Both depict a version, neither being wrong or right, just their version.

===message:Ms. Turner I like your assesment of the artwork.  I feel that your opinion is on point.  However, I do have some problems with the rise of facism.  I feel that many of these individuals did thrive econimically if they belonged to the right party.  Because of this they wer able to place thier will on the others.

===message:I agree with you that the Age of Anxiety was a time for social change. Yes, I believe that art was an  expression of indivualism. They looked for a more calm and peaceful inner being. And art was one of the expressions that provided this comfort. I feel that the people expressed the colors to mean the different cultures (as we still distiguishes today.) The many faces could mean the many people that poverished in the war or the many saddened faces they left behind. 
 When the Great Depression took place this was total defeat. People often seekd peace or look to another source when they are not getting an understanding about their surroundings. Facism, Nationalism and Communism was able to take over and provide people with despair another alternative.
