===subject:need for policy statement
===message:I see a real need for an up-front policy statement that explains the responsibilities of both the student and instructor re. response time, courtesy, respect etc. Have you seen such statements in online courses/course supplements?

===subject:time for using classnet
===message:There seems to be a great deal of time in responding to the students' questions and in posting other questions or assignments.  But I think it is a great way to get the large group of students to interact...and that is the point!

===subject:Class discussion on web
===message:Sometimes the best questions/discussions happen in my class when students in a class hear other questions and answers and respond.  Thus the discussion happens because they are all in the same room listening.  Can this be duplicated in a web format where they read answers posted over several days time?

===message:What's the learning curve for something like this? Do you
demonstrate how to use it to the students the first day?
Who's around to answer questions about use of ClassNet? Do
you give a handout about ClassNet? (can we have a copy of
it?) Do you have a discussion thread about Frequently Asked
Questions on ClassNet itself?

===message:This workshop was useful in showing new ideas on how to interact with students - I think I'll have them write all their own tests from now on! I've done many of these things on bulletin boards for years, but this should be more efficient.

===subject:using classnet in sociology
===message:I teach an intro to sociology class and have 400 students. What if students ask questions like "How does the income distribution of the U.S. that you showed in class compare to Iceland?" or something else that would require quite a bit of my time to track down? They could be asking me about anything in the history of humankind? Any suggestions?

===subject:effort and recognition
===message:Setting up and running a class like this takes time and effort.  In many departments and colleges all teaching efforts are considered second class activities that do not count in faculty reviews or for promotion and tenure evaluations (only published research and grants count).  Is there recognition of faculty efforts for on line /webct classes?
