===message:Hah!  Good question - and you will get those kinds of questions - and you DON'T have an infinite amount of time to answer them.  I'd say this:  don't be afraid to say "I don't know", take advanatage of the opportunity to say "gee - nobody knows - there is research going on in that field currently", refer them to their textbook or other info source (you can put clickable links into your response:  <br>
<br> <a href="http://www.rsk.is/skattyfirvold/Income.asp">Income and Taxation in Iceland</a> <br>
<br>
), or you can turn the question around and ask THEM to see if they can find any information on their topic of interest.
