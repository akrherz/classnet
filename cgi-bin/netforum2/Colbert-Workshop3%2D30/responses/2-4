===message:<pre>hmmmmm - I really haven't had much problem - but that
 doesn't mean that I (or you...) won't.  These are some
 things that I include in my course syllabus that address
 some of your concerns:


NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY:

	Iowa State University is "dedicated to fostering an
 environment in which differences in people such as 
nationality, race, gender, religion, cultural background,
 physical ability, and sexual orientation, are respected and
 mutual understanding is promoted." (from the ISU Bulletin)

2.  Students may post a response to the summaries of the In-
Class discussions.  Each response (excluding rude/irrelevant 
replies) will add 1 (one) point to your score in this 
course.  Each student may receive a maximum of 4 (four) 
extra credit points during the semester.  Details on this 
opportunity will be given when the in-class discussions are 
held.

EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENTS:


	1.  Promptly sign-up for ClassNet.  Scores will be 
posted on ClassNet.  Some 	assignments will require the use 
of ClassNet.

	2.  Realize that the students in this class have a wide 
range of interests/career goals in 	biology - so we'll be 
addressing a wide range of topics.

	3.  Attend class and don't cheat.


WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THE INSTRUCTOR:


	1.  Sincere caring about your progress in learning about biology.

	2.  Enthusiasm for the "wonders of biology".

	3.  Willingness to answer/discuss your questions both
 inside and outside of class.

	4.  Greater willingness/ability to help you with
 problems if you notify me in advance.

	5.  Storage of PowerPoint lectures on the Darwin server
 for student use.

	6.  Prompt and (hopefully!) accurate posting of your 
scores on tests, quizzes, assignments, 	etc. on ClassNet.
