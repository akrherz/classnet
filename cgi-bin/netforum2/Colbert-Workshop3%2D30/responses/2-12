===message:I'm not aware of any particular recognition other than the students (at least sometimes) appreciating your efforts, which is (sometimes) reflected on one's course evaluations.  As far as promotion, etc. is concerned if you put this together in a package with $0.35 you can, of course, make a phone call.......  I guess that I think there are many ways to teach well (and poorly...), but the only real reason for teaching well is that you "love" your discipline and love to help young people know and care about it.....
