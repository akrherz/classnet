===message:<pre>Good question - on the syllabus I give them these instructions:

Sign up for ClassNet Assignment  (2 points)

	1.  point your browser to:  http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu/
	2.  click on "ClassNet Main Menu"
	3.  click on "Join a ClassNet class"
	4.  select the class "Bio 202 Colbert"
	5.  enter your name and e-mail address
	6.  enter your password  (PLEASE do NOT forget your password - I don't know it, only
YOU do)
	7.  click on "Enroll"
	8.  To receive credit you must enroll by Sunday January 16 at 11:59 PM



	I then do a little bit of demonstrating ClassNet in class (need to have computer on-line to do that). 
 I do some, but not very much, individual consultation.  The students seem to pick it up pretty quickly.
