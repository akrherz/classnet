cnet_admin.pl is a subset of functions take from admin which
are needed to start a forum. For some reason I could not
get 'require' to work with the entire module -- even after
commenting out the code ahead of the subroutines.

A change was also made in admin to fix one of their bugs. It
is noted by ISU CHANGE. Other changes are also noted similary
in files in admin or lib directories

For some reason, they change all %20 to '-', which screws up
our code. Code was added in instructor and student
to account for this. Now,the classnames in netforum2 will
not be the same as in /local/classnet. classnet %20's are 
converted to -'s and all classnet -'s are converted to %2D.
