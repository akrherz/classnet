===message:actually, I am logged into the meteo.206 classnet, but am not able to get into the assignment for "graphing" which is due on the 24th because it is asking me for another password, which I am trying to figure out, my 9-digit ID # is not working, nor is my WEB CT password, or the "temp" ID Prof. Cervato gave me.  So in reply to the above, it IS possible to write on the message board and not be able to log in to the assignments.  If anyone can help or figure out this problem, let me and everyone else know, because I am not the only one around here trying to do this!
