===subject:Hilton Head Gullah
===message:I lived on Hilton Head Island for close to four years and have seen firsthand some of the things the author mentions in the last chapter. The Gullah culture is suffering from the buyout of lands for luxurious coastal homes although without the resort island there would be no jobs. Taxes are very high in the area and development is moving inland rapidly. The homes they build there are cheaply done with shoddy materials but carry a hefty price tag. Most are unoccupied for several months of the year. I can remember an incident involving one of the local Gullah prominent family members taking loggerhead turtle eggs from nests on the beach. The eggs were confiscated.  He was going to be arrested and fined. He was to be made an example of to the surrounding community to the new eco-friendly court approach. The turtle people threw a fit. Apparently, the consumption of loggerhead turtle eggs is considered an aphrodisiac to the Gullah culture. The eggs can carry a hefty price these days. The nest raider’s sentence and fines were reduced to community service.

===subject:Red Abalone
===message:Red Abalone (Haliotis rufescens) of the Pacific coast is the largest abalone species in the world, commonly measuring 6 to 8 inches across the widest part of the shell. The largest recorded red abalone was taken in September, 1993 off the Humboldt coast by John Pepper of Half Moon Bay, measuring 12 5/16 inches. Reds are one of about 130 abalone species world wide, eight along our coast. Abalone is a gastropod, in other words, a snail. 

Abalone is a top tourist attraction on the north coast of California, counted among the spectacular beauty of the rocky undulating coast, pocket beaches, and quaint little towns. Nearly 100 percent of California's sport abalone effort is concentrated along the Sonoma and Mendocino County coasts (most of that is in Mendocino) infusing an estimated $9.5 million into the sleepy economies. There are times during "abalone tides" when the services of our small communities are stretched beyond capacity. The traffic along Highway One becomes congested, and every turnout is packed with cars. People in wetsuits wander through the bushes, down cliffs, even in the markets. 
They come because this is the area of greatest abundance, and the abalone are easy to get. Some build an entire vacation around it. Expensive dive equipment, boats and outboards are common. The ritual of getting the abalone, often requiring pre-dawn preparation because of tidal factors, is followed by cleaning, pounding, and eating -- much of the time done by family groups and dive clubs. Large abalone feeds are the rule. The sound of abalone being pounded into tenderness can take on the dimension of a construction project. Having eaten it prepared a dozen different ways, I wonder how the frenzy over this creature could be motivated by its mild, veal-like flavor alone. 
Although sport abaloneing is its own reward, some folks justify the time and expense by attaching a perceived value to their catch. Commercial abalone prices sky-rocketed in recent years from increasing world demand and decreasing wild stocks. In Japan, for example, a single abalone can bring $100, and in California, $35 a pound! I said "perceived value" because sport-taken abalone cannot be legally sold, and in fact, commercial fishing for wild abalone is no longer permitted in California waters. This, however, has not stopped sportsters from boasting about the dollar value. A cleaned abalone can weight a pound or more, and since a person is allowed to have three, the perceived value can be $100 to $200 for a morning's catch. 
Most animal crises-type stories today are about an animal whose numbers fell when the white man became involved. The abalone story, however, has a different twist. It begins with the removal of the major shellfish predator -- the sea otter -- by over 150 years of intensive fur hunting beginning in 1741. The unthreatened abalone, a nocturnal crevice dweller, began an over-population campaign that went unchecked for decades. Without predation, they overflowed their crevice refuges and began to crowd the outer surfaces of the rocks, in some places piling on top of each other. 
The first to recognize an opportunity in this huge excess and take commercial advantage it were Chinese fishermen sometime after the Gold Rush. They harvested the abalone from skiffs, dislodging them from the rocks and hooking them up with long poles. Annual harvests of mainly green and black abalone reached 4 million pounds by 1879. In an era when California was overtly anti-Chinese and just beginning to wake up to resource protection, a law disallowing abalone fishing in less than 20 feet of water put them out of business. 
The next phase of harvest went to Japanese divers who eventually introduced hard hat technology. By 1935, annual harvests climbed back to nearly 4 million pounds. World War II, and the internment of Japanese Americans, ended their involvement. Commercial abalone diving would be dominated by European-Americans from then on. 
The modern commercial harvest began with a low of 100 thousand pounds in 1942 to a high of 5.4 million pounds in 1957. Landings remained high until the early 1970's when a steady decline began. In 1991, landings for all species of abalone were less than 400 thousand pounds. 
The story from this point is about the competition for the remaining harvestable abalone. Competitors included, of course, the commercial divers who wanted to keep their businesses alive. There was a thriving re-established sea otter population, numbering about 2,000 animals, all consuming 23% to 37% of their body weight each day in all manner of sea creatures including abalone. There was an increasing number of sportsters, both divers and rock pickers, entering the sport each season, harvesting over a million pounds a year from central and northern California (down from 3.4 million pounds in 1986). Finally, there was (and still is) the black market where illegally obtained abalone fetched high prices, involving people in both the commercial and sport sectors. 
Along the southern California coast (Point Conception southward), the resource was a disaster. Commercial and sport divers had taken their toll, but a final blow came from industrial waste and big city sewage practices, wiping out large areas of kelp forest and decimating many important marine species. Some areas had been closed for years to taking abalone, and periodic checks showed no recovery. 
And along the central California coast (Point Conception to San Francisco) where all the competitors converged, harvestable abalone were declining. Changes in the sport regulations, such as the reduction of the sport limit from 4 abalones to just 2 in possession, were enacted after the damage had been done. A recent law had allowed commercial divers into an area previously open only to sport divers, increasing pressure on the remaining abalone there. And where the sea otters foraged, legal-size abalone didn't exist. 
Finally, in 1998 the California Legislature closed all fishing for wild abalone, both sport and commercial, south of San Francisco until the resource could recover and once again support a fishery. 
Along the northern California coast (north of San Francisco), where sport abalone is still permitted, everything is different. Commercial abalone diving is banned. There are no sea otters. Where central and southern California sport divers were allowed to use scuba equipment, giving them long bottom time in relatively deep water, only breath holding -- no scuba -- may be used in these waters for taking abalone. This allows access only to the shallow segment of the abalone population, preserving the deep-water stocks for repopulating picked-over areas. A bonus for the region has been the commercial urchin industry. They have reduced sea urchin stocks that directly compete with abalone. Evidence indicates that abalone have an accelerated growth rate when food and space are unlimited. 
Clearly, the northern California abalone resource is a success story, but not without its problems. Although considered healthy, it is actually unknown how the resource is doing -- whether it is sustained or declining. There is fear that poaching of the deep water stocks will permanently damage the cycle of recruitment into shallow water. 
While abalone poaching has taken on the dimensions of organized crime, sport divers are just as much in the equation of decline. Roadside check points operated by California Department of Fish and Game have shown that about 13% of the sport divers are in violation, much of which is possessing over the limit of three abalones per person. Most of these folks are trying to keep plenty on hand in the home freezer. They fail to see the damage they are doing or the example they are setting for family, friends, and neighbors. Some, however, hoard them to sell later. North coast abalone, still plentiful and easy to get, are the obvious target of black market traffickers. The $35-per-pound price tag is a definite incentive. 
So, for the moment, let's put aside flavor and greed as motivators. I would then ask of the rock picker, "What makes you get up at 4:30 to 5:00 AM, struggle into a cold, damp wetsuit, wade waist deep into the icy water, reach into a dark hole where unknown evils lurk, and feel around for a snail? And of the diver I would ask, "Why would you spend $1,000-plus on equipment, spend all day in a wetsuit through all the hours of preparations and cleanup, when the actual diving time for the abalone is probably no more than 30 minutes?" The answer to these and a hundred unmentioned hardships must be, "Because it's the sport." It requires skill and know-how. The period of apprenticeship necessary to achieve any reasonable success is like a rite of passage. Milestones are one's first abalone, first limit, first 9 incher, first 10 incher. There's camaraderie, swapping tales and lore, and sharing food. For some folks, it's a sub-culture. There's even an "Abalone Song". 
Anchor Bay, it seems, is the geographical center of the remaining red abalone sport fishery. I'm not sure if this gives us any special perspective, but you can't live here, or even visit here, without feeling its presence. The giant red abalone is no mere snail.

===subject:Mono Lake, CA
===message:Mono Lake has beenin the news a lot around here through the last few years.
As the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
diverted sierra runoff for use in southern California,
it's water level had dropped to the point where native
flora and fauna were being threatened. Just this year
agreements were reached whereby the water level would be
allowed to rise again and after a really heavy 1995
winter it did.

Mono Lake is one of the really really great things to
see around here. Start your tour at the new Visitors
Information Building but be sure to actually go out,
drive down and park at the lake, and walk around. The
tufa formations, zillions and zillions of visible shrimp
floating through the lake, and the hordes of tiny flies
at waters' edge feeding on the shrimp (the flies don't
bother people, they mass on the ground at waters edge)
are very memorable. Mono Lake is one of the few places
the California Gull reproduces safely protected on the
mid-lake islands. (As the water dropped the islands
became connected to the shore allowing predators easy
access to breeding and young gulls. The higher water
level put an end to that for all except the coyotes who
own boats.)

You can swim in Mono Lake if you want. The very high
salt concentration makes for an interesting and bouyant
experience. Of course the water can be very cold...so
you won't do it for long. You can fish Mono Lake, but
since there aren't any fish you won't have much luck.
And for something really fun, rent a Kayak and paddle
the lake. If you have two weeks to spare you can walk
around the lake, it's only about 500 zillion miles
around (it's a big lake). Mono Lake is about 30 minutes
north of Mammoth Lakes on HWY 395, and adjacent to Lee
Vining. You can see it from Mammoth Mountain and Tioga
Pass as you come down.

They preserved the lake for its environmental beauty and
uniqueness. I have attached pictures of the lake.

===subject:Environmental Benefits of Beach Nourishment
===message:One of the most important questions that I'm faced with when the Corps is performing a shore protection project is: What impact will this project have on the environment?   Taking action to increase the amount of shoreline sand can be beneficial to the environment.  Although these benefits may not be as noticible in the short-term, in the long run most beach wildlife will benefit from the wider beach.  

Two prime examples of species benefiting from wider beaches are sea turtles and shorebirds. Renourished beaches provide habitat that these species need to nest. For instance, I'm involved in a study to renourish a section of Gasparilla Island where the beach has eroded all the way back to the seawall, or other type of existing hard structure.  Gasparilla Island is a barrier island located on the southwest coast of Florida.  The beach has eroded away leaving little, or no place, for sea turtles to nest.  As a result, sea turtle nesting activities have almost diminished.  Since sea turtles are known to return to the same beach to nest year after year, you don't see a decrese in the number of turtles that come up on the beach, you just see a decrease in the number of nests. If a new beach is built, these turtles will then be able to nest again.  

Sandy beaches also provide nesting areas for shorebirds such as plovers and terns. On Gasparilla Island, there is a small shorebird colony that is in danger of being impacted by the eroding shoreline. 

Whether nesting sea turtles or shorebirds, they need the sandy beaches for their survival.  And sometimes, I like to think that these beach projects are providing habitat for environmental benefits, not just for tourists and economic development.

===subject:Constituency of Ignorance
===message:Cornelia Dean states at the end of the first chapter of Against the Tide, "...the nation's increasing commitment to living on the beach has created a powerful force against the application of knowledge already in hand.  There is a kind of constituency of ignorance, people who have so much invested in coastal real estate that they do not want to hear how vulnerable it is." (p.13) I like Dean's phrase "a constituency of ignorance" (p.13).  This seems to be widespread in this country, not just in relation to coastal areas.  I was surprised when I saw the results of the paying for coastal insurance poll, with the majority of the answers "private landowners" or the equivalent.  I guess I am always of the impression that people don't know better, that you can always give them safety precautions, but many people have an "invincible syndrome" where they don't feel like the worst can happen to them.  When hurricane Andrew narrowly passed Miami, Tampa, and New Orleans, people thought that they survived a terrible storm, when in reality, the storm didn't actually "hit" these areas, and so residents barely escaped mass destruction.  For these reasons, I think insurance needs to be government regulated, with informed experts granting building permits, and therefore the government needs to provide the funding. If the experts know the extent of damage that can be done in certain areas, and know that they will have to pay for it, they should not grant building permits.  In contrast, an average coastal landowner may pay all of the money to insure their building, and feel a false sense of security, not realizing the extent of the emotional and physical damage that realistically could happen. To some people, a beach residence is worth all of the money to insure it, but is it really worth losing everything you own, and possibly getting hurt in the process? These are the kinds of questions that people should ask themselves, but unfortunately cannot really prepare themselves for.

===message:Now that the House and Senate are firmly in Republican hands, it was reported in The New York Times last week that the first "environmental" issue is the renewed push to open the Arctic Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration. More than ever, big oil is well represented in this administration. The attitude against environmentally sensitive areas is insulting to people in our field. I fear that within the next two years, many policies that benefit businesses like the timber industry, oil exploration and heavy industry (low pollution standards), will significantly increase. While it is easy for this administration to reverse so many protection policies of the previous administration, future governments will have a difficult time reversing the existence of oil wells in a wildlife refuge. Again, short term gain will destroy rare refuges of pristine land. Just as we shake our heads about some dumb policies of the past that we read about in our books, so will future generations about what is about to happen.

===message:You can't know where you are going till you know where you have been.   After reading, watching the videos, and searching the web... I had almost forgotten what we are truly studying and why.  I needed to refresh myself. So I turned to the following.......  for those of you who have not experienced it, and for those of you, like me, who have not revisited these words in a while  
<br>
The Marginal World
<br>
The edge of the sea is a strange and beautiful place.  All through the long history of Earth it has been an area of unrest where waves have broken heavily against the land, where the tides have pressed forward over the continents, receded, and then returned.  For no two successive days is the shore line precisely the same.  Not only do the tides advance and retreat in their eternal rhythms, but the level of the sea itself is never at rest.  It rises or falls as the glaciers melt or grow, as the floor of the deep ocean basins shifts under its increasing load of sediments, or down in adjustment o strain and tension.  Today a little more land may belong to the sea, tomorrow a little less.  Always the edge of the sea remains an elusive and indefinable boundary.  
<br>
The shore has a dual nature, changing with the swing of the tides, belonging now to the land, now to the sea.  On the ebb tide it knows the harsh extremes of the land world, being exposed to heat and cold, to wind, to rain and drying sun.  On the flood tide it is a water world, returning briefly to the relative stability of the open sea.  
<br>
Only the most hardy and adaptable can survive in a region so mutable, yet the area between the tide lines is crowded with plants and animals.  In this difficult world of the shore, life displays its enormous toughness and vitality by occupying almost every conceivable niche.  Visibly, it carpets the intertidal rocks; or half hidden, it descends into fissures and crevices, or hides under boulders, or lurks in the wet gloom of sea caves.  Invisibly, where the casual observer would say there is no life, it lies deep in the sand, in burrows and tubes and passageways.  It tunnels into solid rock and bores into peat and clay.  It encrusts weeds or drifting spars or the hard, chitinous shell of a lobster.  It exists minutely, as the film of bacteria that spreads over a rock surface or a wharf piling; as spheres of protozoa, small as pinpricks, sparkling at the surface of the sea; and as Lilliputian beings swimming through dark pools that lie between the grains of sand.
<br>
The shore is an ancient world, for as long as there has been an earth and sea there has been this place of the meeting of land and water.  Yet it is a world that keeps alive the sense of continuing creation and of the relentless drive of life.  Each time that I enter it, I gain some new awareness of its beauty and its deeper meanings, sensing that intricate fabric of life by which one creature is linked with another, and each with its surroundings.

"The Edge of the Sea"
Rachel Carson  1956

=========yorg=========
===from:Rick
===date:Thu Nov 21 20:02:27 2002
===subject:Fifty years, two views, one beach
===message:In 1956 Rachel Carson described the "undisturbed beaches"  of Sanibel Island.
She took a boat to get there, and walked through the "pristine" dunes and along the "untouched beaches."
Of note is the way she describes the effects of storms and hurricanes on the beach.  Compare her description with Dean's and some of the loss of poetry at the waters edge becomes personified and engages one to ask… what will we have 50 years from now?
<br>
The Edge of the Sea, (Carson, 1956, 179-180)
<br>
On the upper beach, beyond the zone where the flood tide returns the sea water twice daily, the sands dry out.  Then they are subjected to excesses of heat; their arid depths are barren, with little to attract life, ore even to make life possible.  The grains of dry sands rub one against another.  The winds seize them and drive them in a thin mist above the beach, and the cutting edge of the wind driven sand scours the driftwood to a silver sheen, polishes the trunks of old derelict trees, and scourges the birds that nest on the beach.  
<br>
But if this area has little life within itself, it is full of the reminders of other lives.  For here above the high-tide line, all the empty shells of the mollusks come to rest. Visiting the beach that borders Shackleford Shoals in Norrth Carolina or Florida's Sanibel Island, one could almost believe that mollusks are the only inhabitants of the sea's edge, for their enduring remains dominate the beach debris long after the more fragile remnants of crabs and sea urchins and starfish have been returned to the elements.  First the shells were dropped low on the beach by the waves; then, tide by tide, they were moved up across the sands to the line of the highest of the high tides.  Here they will remain, till buried in drifting sand or carried away in a wild carnival of storm surf.
<p>
From the Carolinas south the beach world seems to belong to the several species of arks, whose shells outnumber all others.  Though variously shaped, their shells are stout, with long straight hinges.  The ponderous ark wears a black, beardlike growht, or periostracum, heavy in fresh specimens, scanty or absent in beach-worn shells.  The turkey wing is a gaily colored ark, with reddish bands streaking its yellowish shell.  It, too, wears a thick periostracum, and lives down in deep offshore crevices, where it attaches itself to rocks or any other support by a strong line or byssus.  While a few kinds of arks extend the range of these mollusks throughout New England (for example, the small transverse ark and the so-called bloody clam -one of the few mollusk that has red blood) it is on southern beaches that the group becomes dominant.  On famed Sanibel Island on the west coast of Florida, where the variety of shells is probably greater than anywhere else on our Atlantic coast, the arks nevertheless make up  about 95 percent of the beach deposits.
<br>
the pen shells begin to appear in numbers on the beaches below Capes Hatteras and Lookout, but perhaps they, too, live in the most prodigious numbers on the Gulf coast of Florida.  I have seen truckloads of them on the beach at Sanibel even in calm winter weather.  In a violent tropical hurricane the destruction of this light-shelled mollusk is almost incredible.  Sanibel Island presents about fifteen miles of beach to the Gulf of Mexico.  On this strand, it has been estimated, about a milliion pen shells have been hurled by a single storm, having been torn loose by waves reaching down to bottoms lying as deep as 30 feet.  The fragile shells of the pens are ground together in the buffeting of storm surf; many are broken, but even those not so destroyed have no way of returning to the sea, and so are doomed.  As if knowing this, the commensal pea crabs that inhabit them creep out of the shells like the proverbial rats abandoning a sinking ship; they may be seen by the thousand swimming about in apparent bewilderment in the surf.
<p>
Against the Tide (Dean, 1999, pg. 143)
<br>
For example, Sanibel, Florida, a heavily developed Gulf Coast barrier island linked to the mainland by only one bridge, now requires all buildings open to the public and containing more than three thousand square feet to be equipped as refuges of last resort.  
<br>
If you have been "shelling" on Sanibel recently, you can't help but wonder.

===message:One of the more interesting CZM issues that i have seen personally is the issue of development around a bioluminescient bay.  On the southern coast of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques there is a fairly large lagoon connected to the Caribbean Sea by a long narrow channel. This body of water, know as Mosquito Bay, contains one of the highest resident concentrations of Noctiluca ( bioluminesciesnt plankton) in the world.  <p> 
This area has long be a popular for the few tourists that frequent the island, as the shores of the bay are largely deviod of development and the concurrent light pollution that limits the luminary effects of the plankton.  The primary reason for this lack of habitation is that most of the bay is surrounded by a military base, which obviously prevented large-scale building.<p>
This is emminently going to change.  The US military, in the wake of an accident that claimed the life of a local, is leaving Vieques.  The base land, once restricted to the public, will be sold off to the highest bidder.  This will most definetly lead to an increase in the number of people living around the bay.  Now, the question is this:  which, in the long run, will be more beneficial to the people of the island - the land surrounding the bay or the draw of the bay itself?  I beleive that the bays days arte numbered.  Only intervention from an organization such as TNC will have any effect on saving the situation.
