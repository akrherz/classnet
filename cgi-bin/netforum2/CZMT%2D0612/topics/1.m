===subject:Discussion Galveston
===message:I'm not sure if this is what we are supposed to do but here it goes.

I think the Galveston incident could happen again as far as damage to the infrastructure of a community. Hurricanes are very powerful having participated in a few myself while in South Carolina. The loss of life would not occur because of todays advanced weather detection equipment. The loss of life has more of a potential to happen in less developed nations where they may not have the resources to evacuate thousands of people efficiently. It could be prevented by not developing communities on such unstable land. The dunes they removed to fill in low areas may have weakened the flood waters which was probably directly responsible for the great loss of life. Coastal communities will always be threatened by devastating natural disasters. The interaction of sea and land will always be dynamic.

===message:Unfortunately, even today, people refuse to realize that the beach is dynamic: a moving and changing environment that adapts to storms and changes.  The properties and investments along the shore are more important to protect than the beach itself.  This is where sea walls come into play.  Galveston's "armoring" of its town and raising of its land above sea level seemed a good idea at the time, but the sea wall can only hold off the sea for a short while.  Since the beach is compromised by severe erosion, a huge storm could come along and the whole sea wall could collapse during it...beach erosion means less and less support for the sea wall, which accelerates its own destruction by creating greater beach ersion.  Although there is better tracking systems today and better warnings, there are 100 times more people living in the area...which means a longer time to evacuate.  People who stay b/c they feel "safe" and "protected" by the sea wall, could be the new disaster when the wall collapses in a huge storm due to beach erosion.  As stated in the book, "the best protection is a wide, healthy beach".  The beach must be free to move and respond to storms...the beach is not just the visible sand and dunes, but the sand bars and beach slope beneath the waves.  Putting a stationary and fixed wall in a dynamic and changing environment is not the answer and could lead to a destructive and devistating event.

could it happen again? How should we prevent something like this from happening again? 

Yes, the Galveston incident can happen again. The engineers design levees, dykes, break waters, and concrete walls to do natures job.  This is because in the U.S. and around the world we allow people to build on barrier islands. The very things that protect our coastline from these type of storms.  The death tole will not be so high, because of modern technology and evacuations but property damage will be the same.

I don't think there is any real prevention other than don't live in the area.

My original message was much longer but I accidentally cleared it, so bear with me. I will write more when I finally get the books.

Thanks

===message:In my opinion, a disaster like the one in Galveston could definitely happen again. Galveston was unprepared for a hurricane, particularly because they were not accustomed to getting hurricanes in the area. We are entering a period of time where there are going to be more hurricanes-- recent research by NOAA has shown that weather seems to go in cycles, with periods of high hurricane activity, and periods of lower hurricane activity. With the recent arrival of Hurricane Lilli, the hurricane center in South Florida has announced that this has been the busiest they have been in decades. Because there are certain states and parts of the world that are used to having hurricanes hit, these places will be more prepared to deal with them. However, like Galveston, it is the places that are not used to having to deal with hurricanes that are more vulnerable to being hit with a disaster like the one in Galveston. Even places that are prepared, like the Florida Keys, are vulnerable because of all of the development and building going on down there. To prevent such a disaster from happening, I think that places with higher hurricane activity should compile information that other local governments should use to safeguard their areas against such disasters. All places should have emergency evacuation procedures that they can implement for any emergency, and designated areas where building is restricted.  This will hopefully create safer environments.

===subject:Hurricane and Coastal Storm Damage
===message:I have not yet received the book, Against the Tide, but thought I would join in on some of the discussions regarding hurricanes and the coast.  Since I work for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Coastal Program, I’m very familiar with the Federal efforts to protect coastal areas from hurricane and coastal storm damage.  The Corps has used a variety of measures to protect businesses, homes and public infrastructure along shorelines.  These measures, in turn, have saved many lives and prevented billions of dollars in damages.  As the biologist on study teams made up of engineers, planners, economist, etc., I am the one who looks for the most “environmentally sound” solution to shore protection.  Generally, I would rather see beach nourishment as opposed to hard structures such as seawalls, breakwaters, jetties, etc.  Most resource agencies i.e. USFWS, NMFS, that I deal with on a day-to-day basis also prefer placement of sand on a beach instead of hard structures.  A more “natural” beach is more appealing to sea turtles and other wildlife.  Realizing the dynamics of a beach, I know at times beach nourishment alone is not enough when it comes to protecting human lives and property.  The seawall in Galveston, Texas, is an excellent example of how a hard structure has kept the city safe from a repeat of the destruction it experienced.

===subject:Sitting Duck
===message:Galveston was the most costly natural disaster in American history, both on a human scale as well as economical. Because satellites and computer models can track and predict approaching hurricanes, the human toll will most likely not be surpassed by any hurricane to hit the US coast. On the other hand, there are large urban centers like New Orleans that are sitting ducks waiting for the big one. When the city of New Orleans ever experiences a direct hit by a category 5 hurricane, parts of the city will be forever lost. Remember, New Orleans is below sea level. The levees and dikes are meant to keep the water out, but a 25-30 foot storm surge will fill this tub and keep the water in. The financial loss to the entire region would easily surpass the toll Galveston had to pay, and it is just a matter of time until the big one strikes.

===message:It is almost impossible to keep people from moving close to the ocean. Many aspects of life depend on it. In California, many counties are limiting the percentage of new housing developments which in turn has skyrocketed housing costs and rents. Development is taking place farther away from the shorline but is still putting pressure on it.

===message:Thank you Professor Schmidt for scanning the Galveston pages to allow us students who have not yet received the book to begin reading.  Was the Galveston disaster a result of human carelessness?  Sure, but ignorance was probably as much to blame.  A storm with that much force may only come through once a century.  Could it happen again?  Of course.  We are still "careless" to the point that we build on barrier islands, in critical erosion zones, etc.  We could experience the same amount of destruction to public infrastructure, homes, businesses, but many lives would be spared due our advanced warning of storms. I find it difficult to believe that we could prevent something like this from happening again.  Why? Because beaches are the livelihood of coastal states.  However, as we know, Mother Nature rules beaches.

===message:Of course the Galvaston disaster can happen again, that storm was a very uncommon one that hit in an ill-prepared location. It is very possible that another storm of that one's caliber could occur again, and likely will, the difference is that in many regions there will be much more advance warning. This will likely save many lives, but will not hold true in underdeveloped locations that lack the technology and resources to detect a large storm in advance. In either case a storm of that magnitude will cause a large loss of life no matter where it hits, unless the region is uninhabited, which is unlikely. In fact, most coastal regions are going to be much more populated and even an early warning is not going to spare everyone. Even regions that have implemented safety standards and evacuation measures will be susseptable to a large storm. The keys take into account the population and evacuation plans when revising their zoning regulations, and even with this it is not fool proof. They use a standard estimate of the number of vehicles per household and the time it would take to evacuate them out U.S. 1. But these precautions are sometimes sercumvented, like how many of the residents that were forced to make homes that were on stilts (or columns, Im not sure the proper term) are now boarding them up and renting them out as apartments. This totally negates the initial reason for making the houses on stilts, and could make it worse because the lower portions are not always as secure as if they were part of the original structure.

===subject:Hurricane
===message:Two things come to mind whenever I review information on the Galveston Hurricane and this article is no different.  The first returns mixed feelings of shock/horror and sheer jaw-dropping wonder. The second, feelings of guilt.  
In August 1969 I was working with a New Orleans Boy Scout troop on a 4 day camping trip in Pass Christianne Mississippi.  Reports of a small but growing Hurricane somewhere in the Gulf were on the radio and the staff and counselors had a meeting on the night of the 14th to decide wether we should cut the "camp-out" short and go home.

The weather was wonderful.  The boys had planned the trip all summer. 
"It would be a shame to disappoint them."
"We are almost five miles in land (on a small bay/inlet) from Gulfport and the beach." 
"No one knows exactly where the hurricane will come ashore." "I was in Betsy (1957) wasn't that big a deal..."(how poor was his memory?)

The younger counselors were kind of excited when we decided to stay one more day.  The older staff, as I best remember, were proud that we were going to stick it out.  You may recall hurricane parties were common in the sixties and  Camille was a "small storm" (if measured by diameter.)  During lunch a police officer stopped by and talked to the "adults."  It turns out there was concern about the potential amount of rainfall and our being able to get out of the camp ground.  We left that afternoon.  

Camille came ashore with winds of over two hundred miles an hour.  Wiped out a hurricane party, flipped a windward section of express way over on topt of the leeward section, and moved a freighter ship 3/4 of a mile inland on a 20+ foot storm surge.

There is no more Pass Christianne campground.  The storm surge traveled up the inlet at no one knows what speed. Some reports put the distance inland of the surge at 8 miles.  I think it went farther.  Cars from the parking lot of a beach Hotel were found five miles inland.

We were lucky I guess,  I think that we would have left when the winds started to pick up any way.  But through all this, my most vivid memory was getting back home and sitting in our garage watching through the open garage-door as the neighbors dog house flew by at about 75 miles an hour. (Wizard of Oz flashback) At about the same time a small TV (how did the electricity stay on?) set up in the garage, showed a news man and camera crew reporting on the condition of the Mississippi levy.  The recovered film? tape? showed the levy breach.  Water came "flying" through the breach, slamming into the camera.  No more crew.

I believe that Camille led to some rethinking about Hurricanes.  But today, when I visit beach communities or go home for a visit, I see very little evidence other than blue "Hurricane Evacuation Route" signs on four-lane hiways that are gridlocked with good weather Sunday afternoon beach returnees.

I feel guilty about helping my home town disappear into the Gulf of Mexico.  I worked for oil companies in S Louisiana during summers while in High school, college etc.  We cut paths through the bayous, sloughs, swamps, wetlands  to let everything from pirogues, equipment barges, to floating exploration rigs into the oil fields. Un-believable money!
But S. Louisiana is a mess.  Where the river used to replenish, now its levy all the ways to Port Sulphur. The protective vegetation is criss-crossed with cut-ups and the entire area is subsiding. The beaches on Grand Isle are disappearing and the the land loss falling into the Gulf represent the greatest loss of American territory since we "let go of the Phillipines" Too few know. I watched my great Uncle's home go from sitting on twenty acres of pasture and forest to an earthen-walled-in acre to pile driven stilt-supported to more stilts, to sadly being moved to a new site and sold.

I did see what I thought was one of the smarter ways to deal with "beach development in Northeren New South Wales Australia.  I don't know how wide spread the regulations were but as I look back on it I doubt they could maintain the regulations under development and financial pressure. As it was explained to me by a resident, "we sort of copied the way we keep sharks away from the beach." 
Shark nets are not strung parallel to the beach to keep the sharks out.  That wouldn't work.  Instead shark nets run out to sea from the beach to keep the sharks from patroling.

No public roads run parallel to the beach as far inland as five kilometers.  All roads are "perpendicular" to the beach.  That region has periodic development along the beach front. That make it more difficult and less attractive for the developers in that there is minimal public support for extendedor spreading development at the water's edge. It would be interesting to return and see if the community has been able to keep the "land-sharks" from patroling the beach today. 

( I've tried three times to get paragaphs into this response, but to no avail. Any help?  Will keep trying.)

===message:I feel that our technology is far too advanced for a hurricane to sneak up onto a city without warning.  There is no question that any storm can and will cause property damage similar to or worse than what occurred in Galveston, TX.  To me it seems highly unlikely that such a high death toll could ever occur from a hurricane.
I am a firm believer that society will continue to build along coasts even after a major storm has destroyed the area.  The coastline continues to be a desirable area to live by and visit, despite the fact that it is a potential danger zone.  Some may feel that modern technology will protect them with warnings, others may be ignorant to the power of nature.
I am not in favor of stopping all building along coastlines simply because we have the means to build successfully in these areas.  Sometimes we alter the ocean’s flow and problems occur by means of erosion.  Unfortunately we try to solve these problems not by putting things back to normal, but by adding more sand to shores so that we may buy some more time.
It may seem nice to stop all building by the coast but who is to say where we should begin or stop building.  I strongly feel that our technology will prevent any storm from taking so many human lives, but as far as property, that is another story.  No matter how we try and defend our shoreline nature doesn’t quit.  This means that anything can happen and probably will happen, but it doesn’t mean that we should not build along the coast.  Society has no problem rebuilding, and our government especially has no problem allowing construction along the coast and even giving money to rebuild.
In conclusion, I feel that society is driven to the coast for a number of reasons, and no matter what level of destruction takes place people will insist on being as close to the coast as possible.

===subject:Technology v. Mother Nature
===message:There is one primary factor that separates the circumstances surrounding the Galveston hurricane and those pertaining to any large storm that might assail our modern coastline - technology.  Granted, the over-development of a tenuously flimsy coastal region led directly to the massive loss of life, but an utter lack of monitoring and warning systems prevented any sort of effective evacuation.  If a comprable storm hit the Texas coast in 2002, there would not be nearly as large a death toll simply because the warning networks and emergency plans that are in place.<p>
<br>
That said, the physical damage such a storm could inflict on the modern coast would potentially be greater.  The continued development and augmentation of the coastlines of our country has remove much of the natural storm buffering capabilities of our shore (i.e. beaches, wetland, shoals, etc.)  Storm surges would penetrate farther into the CZ and erosion would be substantially greater.  Obviously this depend on where the storm strikes, but on the whole the coastline of today is less prepared, in most places, to handle a large hurricane. <p>
<br>
In a nutshell, i do not think that a hurricane would ever kill as many people in the US as the Galveston strom would.  However, the physical and financial damage such a storm could deliver would be much greater.  Unfortunately, we have modified and invested too much money into the development of the coastlines that it is improbable that we could do any sweeping improvements that could save any appriciable amount of the Atlantic coast from serious effects.
