===subject:Traditional 
===message:The Makah make an effective argument.  Legally they should be allowed to do whatever they want.  However, whales are important and protected species. They are charismatic and loved by many.  Other countries also participate in whale hunting for traditional and economic reasons. <br>

<p> Traditions are important to many cultures and should be allowed to continue. Easter Monday is celebrated in many catholic countries. People in Indonesia have traditional harvests of endangered trochus shells, but preserve them by only having the harvests in certain years.  Whaling should be allowed just like these celebrations are in these places.<br>

<p> I do not want to kill a whale or be present when it happens. But it is the right of the Native Americans to do what they please in this case.<br.

===subject:Salmon Homecoming
===message:I would like to take the opportunity to tell a story of the Salmon Homecoming Festival held in Seattle on the downtown pier. It was September 1996 when I had the pleasure to observe some incredible pacific northwest native people ceremonies. I will try to decribe my experience as best as I can. It started with an intriguing play on a small stage called the flight of the three seabirds. A concert of drums and carved wooden horns played while the actors danced in eloborate seabird costumes. The entire pier was dotted with booths containing various arts and crafts and information on the well documented struggles of pacific northwest salmon. Several tribes were represented. The center of the pier was a large open space for trditional ceremonies being held throughout the day. One of these was a dance of all the unmarried women, at least one hundred young women participated. They were dressed in their finest traditional dresses with attached bells jingling all over them. They danced under control and wildly at times in constant circles. Often letting out screams. This was truly amazing.
The final ceremony of the day was in honor of a WWII pacific northwest indian war hero who was in a wheel chair. They formed a huge single file line and pushed him around the entire pier meeting cheers from the crowds of people gathered on the pier. After this they all took turns greeting him with hand shakes, hugs, and kisses. Thank You

===subject:Native People's Rights
===message:One should respect traditional customs and practices of native people regarding the oceans and coasts. Governments should as well. Native people have never overexploited the very animals their tribes depended on generation after generation. Animals and water were an important part of their culture and heritage, unlike western society. They often used most every part of the animal killed. The plains Indians had the buffalo until western civilization intervened. It seems the same has happened to the Makah. Cultures all over the world have experienced this.  Western society has over exploited the resources on this planet usually for profit. Trying to make amends today is a start. The interaction between different cultures and knowledge gained from this can change thought processes. What traditional practices are acceptable and which are not depends on the sustainability of that particular practice. If it involves endangered species, usually brought about by pollution or exploitations, then NO.

===subject:Whaling: BAD, Whale Watching: GOOD, but what about Scalping?
===message:Legally, the Makah are allowed to follow their tradition and hunt for whales in their traditional ways. In exchange for their breathtaking coastal habitat they received the legal right to hunt whales if they moved onto a reservation. The fact that a rifle will be used to shorten the suffering of the animal should be overlooked. Were it not for the industrial whale slaughter of the past by Americans, Russians and Europeans, the occational taking of a whale in the traditional manner would not be an issue today. While the civilized world butchered whales, the Makah looked on in despair, and their contribution to the whale population was to abandon their sacred practice of the whale hunt.<p> Morally, it is wrong to hunt whales. The argument that speaks against this particular whale hunt by the Makah is that it is a purely spiritual element. Why, then, kill the whale, if the population is not dependent on the meat anymore? Isn't the spiritual element in the carving of the canoe, the physical and mental preparation, the tracking, pursuit, and symbolic capture (like tagging) of the whale? By the same token, is it not just a defiance by some members of the tribe to rebel against the world to see if anyone dare stop them? They do have the legal right to kill a whale. Will some native American tribes ever think of reinstating their right to scalp an enemy since the act of scalping was also spiritual and a passage to manhood?<p>Whales could be the cash cow to the Makah, not by killing them but by promoting whale watching tours for tourists. If whales really are their friends, let's go and shoot them with polaroids and camcorders.

===subject:Traditional Practices
===message:This is probably the toughest discussion for me to form a clear-cut opinion about. I think that traditional customs and practices of native people should always be respected, not only regarding oceans and coasts. However, when these practices and customs are destructive to any community or environment, these practices have to be rethought. I like the point made in the video (and also in reply to my last discussion) that humans are part of an ecosystem, and what they do is change their environment. I think I previously thought of humans' overly excessive alterations to their environment as not entirely necessary. However, this way of thinking does not really include humans as part of this world. 
To alter traditions and customs to accommodate changing times and conditions is natural, for safety or humane reasons, and I don't think this is an unreasonable request, as long as the traditions and customs do not disappear entirely (ie there is a written or oral record kept within the tribe, or something else that ensures the changes will not be forgotten). The really difficult part is how modern societies should decide which practices are acceptable, and which are not. I think every practice is unique and must be looked at and treated accordingly. Circumstances are also unique, and while the whaling tradition of the Makah tribe may be able to be altered into a similar sort of physical and spiritual journey without actually killing any whales, I also look at the Treaty of Neah Bay as a reason why the tribe should be allowed to reestablish their traditional practice. Future alterations or treaties may end the practice sometime, but that may take a long time. For now, the tribe should be allowed to continue their tradition. I also agree with Brock that first and foremost, the allowance of traditional practices should depend on the ability of the target species to sustain itself. After that comes the difficult part. This is such a difficult part to discuss because if one practice is allowed, then why shouldn't all of them be allowed? I guess the best thing to do would be to establish a set of regulations that the practices should heed, and then maybe an application process, which everyone would be able to pass, after making necessary adjustments and alterations in order to follow these regulations. This, of course, would be everchanging, to fit the conditions of the time. Wow, I feel like this is so incoherent and babbly, and kind of wimpy, in a way, but I think it is important to be able to back up one's opinion with some sort of solution or suggestion that has a chance of working and appeasing all involved parties, which sounds difficult and at times, impossible to do. I guess that's about it from me for now. :)

===subject:Tradition
===message:This is usually a hot topic and I look forward to a good discussion on this one.  In the case presented in the Makah article, it shows traditional people who where whaling for subsistence and spirituallity actually had the ecological conscience to stop their practices to help the species recover. This tells me that they are aware of the plight of the species and will do what they must to conserve it if their rights are renewed. I think this is a good example of how tradition and modern practices and stresses on marine life can work together.  But in different situations, this can become a horrible debate.  Like the Makah, some tribes have been practicing certain hunts for thousands of years...again...I guess it depends on the status of the animal and if it has a sustainable population or not.  I guess if they can continue their practices while staying between MI and Min, then all can be perceived as "all well".  I was actually thinking about this on a trip into the Everglades a few weeks ago. The Miccosuki (sp.) Seminole indians that live there superceed the laws of no developement and pollution placed upon this wonderful natural area. I was wondering what rights they had and what rights the US government had if the Everglades deteriorated to a level that would question any use. This will always be a heated debate with no decision that makes everyone happy...unfortunately.  If a "traditional" group is taking a small amount of animals out of tradition and some subsistence, then that's one thing, but if they are using their Treaty rights to have an all out killing spree, then that's another.

===subject:Tradition-a question
===message:Great discussion.

I'll play devils advocate.  What if it was the last whale and by some strange coincidence they were still legally allowed to kill the whale?

I was asked this in a conservation class as an undergrad because this question actually arises all the time in the real world. REALLY IT DOES.

I would have to say let them kill it because I believe so strongly in rights being honored.  But I really could not blame people from stopping it or acting illegally if they felt so inclined.  If I were put to the test I would probrably do what I "felt" was right.  Then again I honestly think extinction is a natural process and I am often not in favor of spending gobs of money to save, or try to save small numbers of a species that really has not true future on the planet without help.  Even if we were the cause.

Remember too that many times it is the cute animals (Koala, Panda etc.) that get all the attention when often times it is slimy disgusting worms and bugs that go extinct because they are not the "in thing to save". 

This should get a response.

===message:I find it amazing that the rights of an "indigenous" (growing or living naturally in a certain place, native, Webster, 1987) people can be so swiftly and readily conferred on certain barrier island tribes such as the peaceful Condowellers, the aggressive Builitheres and the ever-so troublesome Jettycuts . Yet let one 2000 year old culturally enriched society attempt to replenish and revitalize a traditional ritual and the tribulation caused by apparently the meer contemplation of such and act seems to threaten  the very fabric of interspecies relationships on possibly a global if not hemispheric scale.  Or is the hyperbole misplaced?

Doesn't the only relatively positive description of an "indigenous" people making intelligent social and economic decisions regarding a barrier island environmental issue
(the Sebastion Inlet Tax district, Dean,pp90-91) reflect the 
contemplative process of the "indigenous" Mahko?  Do not both societies forsee the encroachment of negative influences on their societies; "the march of houses and condos" as well as, "Drugs, alcohol and unemployment..?"

===subject:Makah Whaling and Coastal Policy
===message:I enjoyed the article "Paddling against the tide" and even explored the topic further on the web.  There are a lot of good websites out there discussing both sides of the debate of Makah whale hunting.  I'm neither for or against the Makah whale hunting and managed to keep an open mind while reading viewpoints of both sides.  

The gray whale is a species that scientists have closely observed for many years.  Once protected, the gray whale populations made a comeback and in 1994 the gray whale was removed from the endangered species list.  

It doesn't appear the level of Makah whaling will pose any conservation threat to the species of gray whales, so why not allow them to continue their tradition?  Technically, the Mikahs have a legal right to hunt whales.  They have a treaty with the U.S. that specifically allows them to hunt whales.  It actually appears that the makah are trying to preserve their culture in a way that is consistent with conservation of natural resources.  

It is similar to seeing the importance of striking a balance between MI and MIN.  You have to remember that human beings are a part of the ecology of the earth.  The role of traditional coastal people has to be figured into the equation of how coastal areas are managed.

===subject:treaty rights
===message:I actually wrote a research paper on the legality of the Makah tribe's whaling rights.  As with any arguement, there are two sides.  The tribe has demanded that they be allowed to end their almost century-old recess in whaling, while the world's environmental activist/preservationist groups are wailing away at the "horrors" of the whale hunt. (all the way slamming their fist down upon the emotional touchy-feely push button of the american public) Obviously this is an issue that has inflamed tempers.<p>
However, these environmental groups are avoiding one major point - the US government has an agreement with the tribe allowing them the right to whale.  This agreement vastly predates the MMPA, which i feel, on a few fronts, an  antiquated piece of legislation (re: the effective destruction of the Moss Landing fishing fleet, not by sea or storm, but by beligerent sea lions that can do whatever they feel like without the threat of being asked to leave for other pastures) In any event, the tribe has been entitled to whale, though within the confined of the IWC indigenous peoples clause/quota.  That fact (despite the wailing and gnashing of teeth by Greenpeace, the Sierras, the wacko Sea Shepards, and PETA) cannot be totally denied.
This isn't to say that the tribe is a sweet-natured bunch who simply wants to get back to their roots.  From what i can assess from court proceedings and eye-witness accounts, there are essentially a bunch of angry, poorly educated bunch with serious alcohol issues.  When the first successful hunt occured a couple of years ago, there were several Inuit assistants there to teach and aid the Makahs on the hunt and on the butchering process.  After the whale was killed, the carcass was hauled back to the beach, where there was a brief ceremony where aq small amount of meat was removed and eaten.  Then the tribe took off for a party leaving the poor Inuits to do the bulk of the work.  As it was, most of the meat was wasted.  Evidentally McDonalds is vastly superior than raw whale meat to the native makah palate.  Gross ignorance and incompetance, plus a total misappropiration of tribal rights.  (kicker is they also gave some whale meat to pale-face children at some nearby towns - very, very not legal)
Ok, my rant is almost over.  In this case the US governemnt was pretty much handcuffed.  In the future, the real life viability of tribal customs has to be examined.  Is the custom essential to the culture of the tribe, or is it simply an exercise in flipping the government a collective tribal bird?  These questions have to be asked.....culture isn't a static phenomenon...it is liquid and has to change with the times if nessecary.

===subject:traditional hunting
===message:The idea of traditional hunting, in theory, is what all societies should practice.  There are fewer impacts to the environment when hunting is done in a more traditional way, but that is not one of the more major concerns.  My concern is exactly why native people want to be able to hunt traditionally.  Native people are allowed to use modern devices to track and kill their prey.  Some of these animals are considered endangered species.  Why should the government subsidize them because they go out and kill a few animals a year by “traditional” methods?  I use traditional methods when I bow hunt for deer, but the government doesn’t guarantee me a meal or money when I am not successful in my hunt.  In an example such as this I am not in favor for traditional hunting.  Being subsidized for a traditional way of living only to receive money is in all ways completely wrong, but that issue does not have to be carried on any further.  Back to the article about hunting traditionally to strengthen their society.  I feel that it is everyone’s right to be able to hunt, but again it isn’t right for them to say that they are hunting traditionally if the only reason is for them to be subsidized by the government.  It may be a tradition to hunt certain animals to bring spiritual enlightenment, but if an animal is hunted to extinction how enlightening would that be?  Let them hunt in their own tradition, but in order to achieve their goal of strengthening their community, endangered animals do not have to be harmed.  I have had many a day when I left the forest without shooting at an animal or even seeing one, but that in no way has altered my goal of bonding with friends, family and nature.  As I see it native people want their traditional way of hunting back not for government subsidizes, but because of the spiritual enlightenment of bringing their native tribes closer together.  I say it is not the animal that you hunt, but the people that are influenced in the hunt.
