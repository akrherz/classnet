===message:WASHINGTON (Nov. 22) - The Bush administration relaxed air pollution regulations and proposed other changes Friday to make it easier for older factories, refineries and power plants to modernize without having to install expensive new anti-pollution equipment.

The long-awaited regulatory changes by the Environmental Protection Agency touched off a firestorm of criticism from environmentalists, Democrats and state air quality regulators, and a courtroom challenge from nine Northeastern states affected by power plant pollution.

The agency also proposed a new definition for what constitutes ''routine maintenance, repair and replacement'' at aging coal-burning power plants. It will allow them to make major modifications without forfeiting their exemption from tougher standards imposed on plants built in the past 25 years.

EPA Administrator Christie Whitman said in a statement the changes will ''encourage emission reductions'' by providing manufacturers, utilities and refinery operators new flexibility when considering operational changes and expansion. The old New Source Review program has ''deterred companies from implementing projects that would increase energy efficiency and decrease air pollution,'' she said.

Potentially affected are hundreds of power plants, refineries, paper mills, chemical plants and factories built before 1977, when Congress amended the Clean Air Act requiring state-of-the-art controls on any new sources of pollution.

The older plants were exempted from being treated as new sources of pollution. But as companies started replacing outdated equipment to improve their efficiency, the Clinton administration began treating improvements as new pollution sources, requiring the expensive, state-of-the-art controls.

It pursued vigorous enforcement actions against companies reluctant to make the new anti-pollution investments, targeting in particular 43 power plants owned by nine utilities. Two of the utilities have settled, agreeing to install millions of dollars in new pollution controls at their plants.

Neither the new final rule or the proposed maintenance definition diminishes the agency's willingness to pursue those cases, said John Peter Suarez, EPA's assistant administrator for enforcement issues. ''We are continuing to press ahead with the enforcement cases,'' he said.

Whitman, however, suggested in testimony before a Senate committee in March that a prudent utility executive would await the results of a federal appeals court legal challenge to the existing regulations before settling with the government.

Jeff Holmstead, EPA's assistant administrator in charge of air quality, insisted Friday that the new regulations will produce reductions in total pollution from the plants. ''There will be emissions reductions as a result of the rules we are adopting today,'' he said.

Critics predicted just the opposite.

''More than 30,000 Americans die every year from power plant air pollution alone, and crippling the standards will only make things worse,'' said John Walke, director of Natural Resources Defense Council's clean air program.

A group of Northeastern states, led by New York and Connecticut, said they planned to file suit challenging the changes. In New York, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer accused the administration of attacking the Clean Air Act with rules that would further degrade air quality in Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states downwind from industrial plants.

''The Bush administration is again putting the financial interests of the oil, gas and coal companies above the public's right to breathe clean air,'' Spitzer said.

Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., called on Whitman to resign in protest, saying her advice had been repeatedly overruled by a Bush White House intent on gutting environmental protections.

''Out of principle and protest, she should step down,'' he said. ''All this rule will do is extend the life of the dirtiest industrial plants and worsen the lives of citizens that breathe the pollution from their smokestacks every day.''

The rule changes, a priority of the White House, will:

-Establish a plantwide ceiling on pollution rather than a limit on what is allowed for each piece of equipment. A plant, for example, could install a more polluting boiler as long as there is a corresponding reduction in pollution from another part of the operation.

-Allow refineries, paper mills, chemical plants and factories to use the two consecutive years of their greatest pollution over the past decade as a reference ceiling, meaning they won't have to install new controls unless their emissions exceed that two-year high.

-Exempt plants from having to update pollution controls if the existing ones have been reviewed by the government during the past 10 years.

The agency also proposed allowing power plants, factories and refineries to treat as maintenance - exempt from new pollution controls - the replacement of equipment or other capital investment up to 20 percent of the plant's total value.

The changes were sought by the utility, coal and oil industries, and were the subject of months of review at the White House. The electric utility and coal industries were both major donors to Republicans for the 2002 and 2000 elections.

===subject:Growing Environmental Concern in the 60's and 70's
===message:There was a growing environmental concern in the late 60's and early 70's. This concern was at all levels, international, national and local.  There were several international conferences held that focused on environmental concerns. The IGY involved more that 70 nations in studying the earth.  The Stratton Commission and the Marine Sciences Council proved to have a significant impact on the national ocean program and the coordination of federal ocean activities. The public became more aware of environmental issues through the media and environmental groups such as "Friends of the Earth", "Defenders of Wildlife", etc.  Environmental groups even had a major role in shaping many environmental bills enacted in the early 70's.  The public became concerned about environmental degradation. Rachel Carson's, "Silent Spring" played a significant role in public awareness, as did the the first Earth Day celebration held in 1970.  Environmental issues such as pollution and the huge oil spill off the Santa Barbara coast were regarded as serious issues to the public. The mood of the people was obvious, they were concerned about their environment and wanted to do more to make it better.

===subject:Politics and Ocean Law in the 70's
===message:The 1970's saw a rise in environmental consciousness and many new ocean and coastal programs were enacted into law. There was much political interaction between Congress, the executive branch, and interest groups in shaping these laws.  Several major ocean and coastal laws passed during this time were the CZMA, the MFCMA, the MMPA and the OCSLAA.  The Nixon administration was definately pre-occupied with the war, but did take some action on the environmental front.  For instance, Nixon signed NEPA into law.  NEPA was later considered one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation ever.  NEPA then called for a Council on Environmental Quality to give the president expert advise on environmental matters.  Also during the 70's we saw the enactment of the CWA, MPRSA, and the ESA. During the 1970's, we saw the establishment of these ocean and coastal laws that today make up our current system of ocean governance.

===subject:That 70's Mood
===message:The political environment in the 1970's that helped push the enactment of new ocean laws were influenced by several causes. Congress was reform minded and highly active. Congressional influence in politics increased at the same time the presidency weakened. The Vietnam War was a failure. The Watergate scandal happened along with other presidential program failures. 
<br><br>The mood was shifting to more domestic related issues including the environment and its well being thanks to some inspiring environmental literature. There was also a growing international and national interest in the oceans and environment, mobilization of new environmental special interest groups, and increasing power of congressional subcommittee's influenced by powerful interest groups.
<br><br>The race for space exploration was coming to a close so attention was now being focused on the undiscovered ocean possibilities. Overfishing was introduced as a global problem.
<br><br>There was a broadening of special interest group participation with new ideas and policy concepts pressuring established traditional political organizations to change internally. The majority of ocean laws in the 70's came mainly from Congress and external interest groups, not the executive branch. This congressional interest, the formation of new subcommitte's to further influence Congress, and the organization media use of outside interests helped mahe policy possible. Timely studies calling attention to specific ocean problems. Ocean policy was a new issue area for Congress to write body of political laws, sort of an "uncolonized" issue area.
<br><br>I think today's political mood is a mixed one.  Air quality standrds are being eased to allow big business to catch up to structural regulations. I see grandfathered nuclear power facilities and wastewater discharges. I hear of medical wastes being dumped into the Ohio River. On the other hand, I do see some positive things happening as well. The ban of MTBE in gasoline in California. Legislation stopping the anchoring of ships near Florida to help minimize coral reef damage. Bush has a chance to reverse his previous environmental policy, but looking back when he was the govenor of Texas, it will not happen. I would have to say the outlook is not good.

===subject:70's mood
===message:       The 1970's saw this nation as politically eager to tackle issues that had previously been left out. There was a strong trend towards protecting the environment, as increasing research and data were being collected on the state of our natural resources. Furthermore, technology began to advance at a fast rate. More advanced technology allowed us to take higher advantage of our resources. In addition, states were beginning to take more political responsibility for issues that they viewed as important locally, and issues that should or could not be decided by the federal government. All of these factors helped in enacting the ocean policy laws that came about as a result.

               I feel like the mood of today is one of recognition, acknowledgement, and integration. What I mean is, there are many issues that we are faced with that are a result of our own carelessness or ignorance, so we are recognizing these issues, and acknowledging responsibility for many problems. To prevent this from happening even more, there is a general desire to work together, and integrate departments, so that the policy decisions are made by the scientists, policy managers, politicians, and the general public, not only by the managers. Hopefully, this way we will be able to make better decisions regarding our future.

===message:Times where changing and the shift from space exploration to ocean exploration was taking place.  The 60’s brought peace and love and it made the 70s the time for environmental care.  The people of America made the policies because of problems that they where seeing such as rivers starting on fire.  Extreme circumstances would probably make anyone realize that it is time to start becoming familiar with what we are destroying everyday.  The 80s were a time where the polyticians tried to put the environment on the back burner but I don’t think that we can ever put the environment on hold and this is why I have become involved in environmental issues.  Today I think that are mood is more towards the environment than it was in the 70s when all the laws where passed.  It almost seems that we can not do anything without getting an environmental permit first.  I think it is getting a little out of hand.
