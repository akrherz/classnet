===subject:Governance
===message:Ocean governance like anyothere multiple use media is hard to make general law about. Everything about the ocean is specific ie. Fisheries, resources(oil), erosion, sea level, shipping, military use, EEZs.  Sovereign nations close to each other like Canada and the U.S. have dual responcibilities because ecosystems do not obey country or state lines. <br>

<p> My friend has a wonderful idea, to make international cities. If you live there, you will be an international citizen. This would make everyone responcibile for there actions on an international instead of sovereign level. His example is of course Jerusalem because of it's volatileness over ownership.  However, if this theory was applied to the ocean and its' use, then maybe the laws made by the international councel would have to be enforced and followed by all sovereign nations. <br>

<p>Let me know what you think.

===subject:Greater State Involvement
===message:The state governments need to become more active in managing an protecting coastal resources for the good of the people of that particular state. These are the people most affected by decisions regarding coastal issues. The federal government needs to delegate most regulatory issues related to shore use to state organizations. Local and regional authority need to be given a greater capacity and influence through he legal court systems. If this means writing and enforcing more rules and regulations on coastal policies, then so be it. Successful watershed management groups could be modeled after. They can have a loud voice when it comes to the sustainability of regional resources. Also, federal policy on the EEZ needs to be readdressed. Jurisdiction rights must be clarified probably through the court system or Congress. Cooperation between federal and state agencies is fragmented, poorly coordinated, and operate as independent entities. This is beaurocratic ignorance. Cohesive planning encompassing all organizations involved will need to happen if our coastal resources are to be endured by future generations. Conservatuion of ocean resources must be a future and central theme of new coatal policy decision making.

===subject:cooperation
===message:Coastal areas in the U.S. are very diverse, and all call for different areas of management. Coastal New England has very different needs than the coast of southern California. This is why it is better for regions to make management decisions. The decisions involved often involve more than just the coastal area, they often involve decisions that will affect the whole state.  The problems arise when these decisions involve different agencies, or levels of  government that often have different interests. The scientific agencies and legal agencies, as well as commercial industries all have conflicting interests. When they are faced with something that will affect all aspects, naturally they are going to have their own self-interest in mind. This is really the root of the problem. Another big problem is that many scientists are unfamiliar with other aspects that must also be met, and vice versa. It will be important to integrate these agencies in the long run.

===subject:Ocean Governance
===message:It is clear from reading the first two chapters of the book that any national ocean governance regime must be a full partnership with States.  But even at a much lower level,  I see the need for partnership between local governments and counties.  I know here in Florida, we are looking at a more regional approach for mining nearshore borrow material for beach nourishment.  This is necessary because some counties have utilized all of their sand sources.  And there are many wars between counties over who has the right to the nearshore sand.  With the many living and non-living ocean resources like marine mammals, fisheries, minerals, reefs, etc., you sometimes have more than one agency or government that has jurisdiction.  An example would be, the USFWS and NMFS both have jurisdictional authority over marine mammals.  And, from my experience when coordinating projects with these agencies, they may have conflicting views and different recommendations for protecting these animals.  When dealing with ocean policies, conflicts do, and probably always will, exist among agencies and between all levels of government over the use of ocean resources.  But these conflicts need to be resolved at the lower levels before we can even begin to think that ocean governance could work at the national level.

===subject:Defragmentation needed
===message:It took a monstrous, terrible act of terrorism and one year of heated debate in our government before a fragmented mosaic of security agencies ranging from local to national were united into the Homeland Security Agency. There is be nothing that will motivate any administration to unite and streamline agencies overseeing coastal governance. This means that other means of cooperation have to be found that please beachgoers, professional fishermen, offshore heavy industry, and national security alike. While no unification of all agencies can take place, a certain defragmentation is needed. A single community, for instance, needs to obey State laws that are in place for the protection of a region. The community should not be allowed to sue and have the law amended for its own good. Examples are exemptions to laws prohibiting jetties or rebuilding on the beach after storms. On a larger scale, a state should not be allowed to exept itself from a law that is protecting the entire coastline or its resources only because the governor/senator/representative of that state is in a position to add pork to an unrelated law about to be voted on simply to gain favorable votes at the next election. The bottom line is that there are no quick fixes for coastal governance, it will require determinantion on every level to get results.

Reports like this bring back memories of a recurring dream I had in my youth; What would happen if I owned the last tree? (the last river bamk, the last beach, etc)
Just replace the word river with ocean, etc. and the story is the same and repeated, and repeated, and repeated.

If this is not a prime example of intergovernmental aspects of (Ocean) governance, what is?

Let it flood  (lead editorial, St. Louis Post Dispatch)

  WHEN THE MISSISSIPPI rises, the tiny Missouri village of Pin Hook becomes an island. Jim
  Robinson hitches a flatbed trailer to his farm tractor and hauls the town's children over the
  flooded roads to their school bus. 
<br>
  Nearby East Prairie gets surrounded, too. In town, the water table gets so high that septic
  systems stop working and toilets won't flush. On the worst days, fish swim on the streets. 
<br>
  "When old John Brown comes in, he just wipes us out," says Mr. Robinson, who farms 700
  acres of bottomland. Sometimes he can't get into his fields to plant until July. 
<br>
  It's easy to see why Mr. Robinson and his neighbors in Southeast Missouri cheer for the
  Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps wants to finish an extravagant $85 million levee and
  pump project that will keep farms and towns much drier. "If we had that levee finished, we'd
  be sort of the garden spot of Missouri," says Mr. Robinson. 
<br>
  Unfortunately, it's a bad idea, and a costly one. Sealing off the river would permanently
  damage a valuable ecosystem and harm wildlife. It could kill off the cypress forest in a
  nearby state park. There must always be a balance between preserving the environment
  and the good of the people. In this case, the balance tips against the 6,000 folks affected by
  rising water. 
<br>
  Besides, there might be a better and cheaper way to keep part of the area dry. 
<br>
  America spent the past century and a half channeling the Mississippi and its tributaries with
  levees and flood walls. The spot just north of New Madrid is one of the few places where the
  lower Mississippi still is allowed into its flood plain. The natural flow of the river as it spills
  into its flood plains prevents much more severe flooding downstream, replenishes the soil
  and provides protected breeding and feeding areas for fish, birds (migratory and resident)
  and other wildlife. We should preserve as much as we can of what this mighty river used to
  be. 
<br>
  Area residents say - correctly - that all that upstream levee-building has made their
  problem worse. Water that can't flood upstream comes rolling into their farms. But in
  addition to the bloated cost of the project, the ecological price of keeping local feet dry is
  simply too high. The area contains 18,000 acres of wetlands. It hosts several fish species
  that are rare in our region. Big Oak Tree State Park would be put at risk. Missouri officials
  fear that the 1,000-acre cypress swamp could die of thirst. 
<br>
  As it often has, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service adamantly opposes the levee and is
  fighting a bureaucratic war with the Corps of Engineers. 
<br>
  "There is no other area along the Lower Mississippi River in Missouri that supports diverse
  and rich fish, wildlife and plant species as well as regionally scarce stream, river and flood
  plain habitats," said the Wildlife Service. The Corps has added $20 million in modifications
  in hopes of appeasing opponents. It would buy 8,000 acres of farmland and plant a forest to
  replace damaged wetlands. But that's not enough. The busy beavers at the Corps should
  abandon this ill-considered plan. 
<br>
  Instead, the state might consider a smaller plan proposed by critics. They suggest building
  a small levee near East Prairie, while elevating roads and improving storm water

===subject:Is red tape considered marine pollution?
===message:Ah......the governemnt in (in)action.  Actually, i really don't mean that. Yes, it frequently appears that our government is out to get itself.  Well, this isn't REALLY the case.  Our government simply is built on decentralization - intergration isn't a really popular topic.  That philosophy obviously doesn't work very well with ocean governance.  To boot, the US government tends to practice a "do as i say, not as i do" attitude when dealing with ocean management.  The lack of coordination between internation ocean organizations and governments, state and federal agencies, and the private and public sectors has fostered an atmosphere of confusion and indecision in ocean goverance.

The lack of cooperation at these different levels stem from different reasons.  The issues with international governance i think come from our (the US) prevailing foreigh policy sentiment of the time. State vs. federal control faces a major issue with adverse effects that originate outside the 3 mile state waters and migrate into local and state jurisdiction. Public vs. private comunication issues are more easily deciphered - resource use needs against conservation needs, while balancing the two.

===subject:Governance of our Oceans
===message:I'm also in another class through Nova called "Life on a Water Planet".  Much of what we are focusing on this week directly relates to this Unit regarding Ocean Governance.  We have been focusing on the challenges of learning to live sustainably with our oceans and how it involves governance at all levels, i.e. Internationally, Nationally, and Regionally. We must look at governance at each level.  There seems to be lack of coordination between each level in ocean governance.  It is almost like there seems to be failure in seeing the "whole" picture.  Agencies tend to target, or address, a "specific" problem or area.  We need to treat the ocean like an ecosystem because everthing that lives in the ocean is interrelated.  Each level of government needs to work in tandem.

===message:Many people think government employees are lazy because of the length of time it takes them to get things done.  Have they ever worked for the government?  I have been working for government agencies for the last six years, and I have put in my share of twenty-four hour days.  The problems that I see in governmental work is no the employees or even the policy.  It is the budget that causes all of the problems.  Who sets the budget?  It is the councilman, house representatives, and senators that we elect.  This is where that problem comes from because a state representative sees things differently than a local councilman.  There are too many go between men/women in the system.  This is why it is so problematic and it takes so long to get something done.  I work for Miami-Dade County and we see the local environment and we know what is happening around the county.  But when someone goes to the federal government for approval and the feds approve there project it is hard for the county to say that the feds don’t know what they are doing.  I think that the system should be retuned such as the federal governement should handle far off shore or public land and the local government should handle the coastline and privately owned lands.
