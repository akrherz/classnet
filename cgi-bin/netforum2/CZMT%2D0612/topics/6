===more:<br>The new book you have started deals with the the 
Inter-Governmental Aspects of Ocean Governance.  
What's your take on the issue of writing and enforcing 
rules about how this whole issue reverberates on 
national coastal policy? (Ocean governances also 
involves some very important regulatory issues related 
to shore use, dumping, draining and filling marshes, 
contaminated ship ballast etc.). Why is it so 
complicated to get cooperation <b>between sovereign 
states and their governments</b> , between 
<b>agencies</b> in the same country, as well as 
between <b>different levels of govt.?</b>
