===message:"Iron Triangle" or "subgovernemnts" in coastal policy is a political subsystem of independent agencies designated with political control over a particular area of concern dealing with coastal and marine resources. Commercial fishing, recreational fishing, and marine mammal management are some examples of areas of concern mentioned in the book. They are also organizations with a closed set of interests working independent of one another and having predictable actions within the higher government branches. They have a narrow single purpose ocean governance in response to a set of problems. For example, saving a particular marine species instead of saving the entire marine habitat. Before 1970, these were state government agencies (wildlife and fisheries organizations)focusing on a specific area of coastal and marine resource linked to the federal government agencies such as the National Marine Fisheries Service and the US Fish ande Wildlife Service. The Sea Grant Program receives funding for marine education. These triangles helped push forward coastal policies because they were failing in the face of exploitation of resources. Such agencies were poorly coordinated, poorly funded, and incongruent with existing policies. A lack of power limited successful management plans. It was fairly clear that reorganization of coastal policy needed to be initiated from the top of government down to the bottom. The book mentions of problems of fragmentation, myopia, overlapping jurisdictions, conflicts among agencies, lack of mechanisms for area wide planning, and basically they were politically weak. States could not control overfishing becuase of the great influence of the industry in politics. The California anchovy was almost overfished to extinction. The policies that the states did come up with limited fishing technology by protecting the status quo and managed species by species not entire habitat protection. The management of coastal development was poor allowing for fast growth along shorelines and a severe reduction in wetland acreage. In response, the federal government assumed some of the responsibility of ocean policy but now seem to be giving it back to the states because of the greater awareness of conservation and resource sustainability and the ability to organize and manage with more authority.

===subject:Iron Triangles in Coastal Policy
===message:"Iron Triangles" or subgovernments are alliances of mutual benefit which develop between interest groups, government agencies and Congressional committees. For example, in the case of coastal policy, we would find several commercial fisheries groups that would represent commercial fisheries interests of some kind.  So combined, interests groups, government agencies and Congressional committees form sort  of a subgovernment (iron triangle) of people who tend to interact mainly with each other to shape public policy on commercial fisheries. Positive results may be more fast- tracked policy making.  The negative effect of Iron Triangles would be the fact that they can dominate policy making and at the same time are only representing a very narrow range of interests. The "public" interest may not be well represented.

===message:An iron triangle is a political scientist's term for the stable interaction between interest groups, and smaller "subgovernments" that before the 1970's, controlled policy decisions for the marine and coastal environments. Because these "triangles" were made up largely of state government, and special interest groups, with minimal involvement by the federal government, they were able to make policy decisions that were pertinent, and in a timely fashion. At the same time, because there are so many different interest groups, when these interests conflict, there is no cohesive unit, no uniformity in policy-making. Instead, each triangle will just be fighting for themselves, with no one looking towards the overall big picture. An example of this is with the Everglades Restoration Project. Because there are so many different groups-- environmentalists, scientists, water managers, developers, etc... these groups spend a lot of their time arguing with each other, in their own interest, when they are supposed to be working together. The interesting part of this project however, is that they must present themselves as a cohesive unit when applying to the federal government each year to ensure continual funding. The end result will be very interesting.

===message:Iron Triangles are multi-group sub-governemnts usually composed of government agencies, special interest groups, and NGOs whose primary purpose is the governance of a specific aspect of coastal policy. Examples of these specific entities include fishing (commercial and recreational) wetlands management, marine education, and marine mammal management. These iron triangles operate with the sole purpose of furthering and protecting their specific interest.  They originally (pre 1970) were organized amongst state and federal agencies, with the purpose to facilitate cooperation between the two within the facet of CZM for which they were responsible.  However, with the widespread environmental legislation of the 70s, the playing field changed drastically.<p>

There is an upside and a downside to these iron triangles.  They were instrumental in pushing forward policy and legislation, though this success was mainly a product of desparation.  The environmental IT was originally a underfunded, underappreciated player in the political area.  However, when this lack of funds led to poor management and environmental degredation, they succeeded in forcing/encouraging the development of several pieces of coastal policy.  On the downside, the exclusivity of the IT disallows groups aside from those within the triangle from fully participating in governance issues.

What's an "Iron Triangle" in Coastal Policy?
Why would these triangles help to push forward coastal and ocean policy? 
Do Iron Traingles have any negative side effects on policy (give examples please)? 

<p> What I understood the Iron Triangles to be is too many hands in the same pot. They could push forward policy by getting the different stakeholders and interest groups together.  However, if all you get are different opinions in a discussion you are not moving forward, just standing still.<br>

<p> An iron triangle in coastal policy was set up by the laws passed in the 70's. It is the CZMA which gives states control over their development of the coasts but allows the federal government to review the plans and allows the resources that are off the coast be controlled by the other agencies.<br>


Thanks for the patience.

===subject:Iron Triangles - A Special Interest Party
===message:Iron Triangles are associations of interest groups that have a common agenda. They are a natural phenomenon since particular groups tend to get together to collectively push their cause and get results. The problem with Iron Triangles is that they quickly can, and do, cross the line from trying to influence policies to making policies, such as is the case with the oil industry. A boundary has been crossed when the oil industry formed an Iron Triangle that has become so influental that the secretary of the interior is considered a part of it. The lesson here is, money will get an Iron Triangle to the highest places of policy making, but in the case of environmental protection, no such triangles existed in the time period discussed in this chapter.

===message:The idea of an “Iron Triangle” is to help implement policies that might not make it to the floor without the help of special interest groups or other institutions or politicians.  The idea of the triangle is to not let one group gain too much control over a topic and also to not let one group totally ignore a specific topic.  The triangle will have both positive and negative effects on ocean and coastal policy.  As you pointed out in your video it is not really a triangle because there are a lot more influences in policy making.  An example of interest groups…an environmental group is pushing for stronger regulations for ocean dumping.  While some people might consider this a positive effect of the triangle another group like the people who wish for less regulation with ocean dumping might feel the triangle is adding a negative effect to their interests.
