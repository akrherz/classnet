===message:My discussion topic posted yesterday is on environmental benefits of beach nourishment.  Just today, I received a copy of the Tampa Bay Soundings (a quarterly newsletter)which has an article regarding my topic.  The title of the article is, Egmont Key: Wildlife flocks to manmade beach; battered island gets reprieve.  The article goes on to say that sand placed on Egmont Key two years ago for erosion purposes has attracted a number of wildlife species.  Sea turtles and shorebirds flocked to the new beach which is more than a quarter mile long.  Sea turtle nesting activity has increased along with nesting shore bird activity.  You may be able to view the article at www.tbsoundings.com.

===message:You make a good point. When I was an "onsite" student at NOVA, I participated in the turtle nest relocation program. We found so many nests that were on just a few yards of beach in front of a sea wall. Left alone, those eggs would not survive since the next tide would submerge the nest. All nests were relocated to a large, replenished stretch of beach where they were out of danger.

===message:I agree that when we go and restore something 9even 
though it's temporary and somewhat artificial) we are 
helping out. The better solution would be to have some 
of the areas that turtles, manatees and other marine life 
need fairly isolated and untouched and then let 
monether nature andd the groins and sea walls chew 
up the places where people have built. Of course the 
Bush family has a house on gasparilla (I've sailed and 
hiked there - charlotte harbor is a great place to sail on 
the West coast of Fl) so maybe the governor and the 
bushe's have a real interest in preserving that area - 
Florida has actually been trying hard after years of 
(often Democratic controlled governosrship and 
legislature) damage.

===message:I like the postings here because i am seeing some very 
good stories about restoration and renourishment. i 
think we need to look for more of these cases where 
people are being smart anmd succeeding ion offering 
nature a small helping hand to continue functioning.

===message:Achim, Did you participate in the relocation program in Broward County?  I've been working for a couple of years now with the County in preparing the EIS for a shore protection study.  During this process, I realized that the County has a great sea turtle monitoring and relocation program.  Of course to minimize the need for nest relocation (and therefore reduce the possibility of nest burial or crushing of missed nests), beach nourishment should be conducted before May 1 or after October 31.  This is preferred, but not always practical.  This particular shore protection study is looking at nourishing over 17 miles of shoreline.  It would take several more years and lots more money to complete the re-nourishing process if limited to only nourishing outside of the prime sea turtle nesting season.  Fortunately, the FWS will allow beach building during nesting season on some of the less active nesting beaches.
