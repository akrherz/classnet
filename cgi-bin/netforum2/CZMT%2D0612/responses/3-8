===message:<br>I think that your comments are very interesting because you have a sort of "fresh" perspective. "Natural" ways of protecting the beach from storm damage has been neglected and people want their houses (or condo buildings) RIGHT on the ocean 9not on the other side of the natural barrier (dunes).<br>
Of course, remember that humans have "controlled" nature almost wherever they live - the big rivers have also been dyked and levied so they don't spill out and flood towns. But, it would be worthwhile for much more reserach to be done on innovative natural ways to reduce storm damage while protecting the natural "breathing" of the shore.
