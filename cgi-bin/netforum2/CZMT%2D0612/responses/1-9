===message:<br>Great comments. People who move to the coast and live in risk zones really do not want to be reminded of the limitations of that life. That's too stressful! I spend a lot of time on the Florida Keys and you can see this mentality everywhere. As time passes that place will become a death trap - one road; too many people!  But humans are like lemmings!
