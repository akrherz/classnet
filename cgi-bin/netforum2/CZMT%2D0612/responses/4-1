===message:I agree with allowing tradition for native cultures but often there are some problems with this.  In Canada, in places such as northern Alberta,  the issue is ofte: what should be accepted as traditional.  For example trapping and hunting are of critical importance to natives in Alberta.  At a reserve where my brother teaches it is tradition not to eat vegetables and the main meat supply is Moose.  They get vegetable nutrients from tea, and internal organ contents from animals.  The problem is getting the animals in terms of what is tradition--are rifes allowed, how about snowmobiles, trapping, use of cars.  These are huge issues in Alberta.
Even simple things such as horses were not traditionally used by native peoples.  Use of the hourse came from Europeans.
So it is only getting harder to address what is traditional native culture.  I also think that even if you could be "true" to tradition it might be to hard logistically ($$ issues etc.) to do so.

Just something to keep in mind.
