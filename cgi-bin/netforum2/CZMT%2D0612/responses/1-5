===message:<br> Good comments and I'm so p....d off the books have not arrived. Amazon.com should deliver overnight so I don't get it. Anyhow, as we see the South Florida area expose itself with intensive beachfront development, the Louisiana coast line and New Orleans, barrier island construction, are we not kidding ourselves - a hurricane 5 can't be contained!  <p> And, as we will see shortly, Americans are moving to the coast in record numbers ... there is a real Russian roulette going on.

===message:Agree, nourished beaches can't stand up to the forces of nature forever, and they too will erode.  Wind, waves, currents move sand around and beach erosion happens naturally.  Then, factor in the human caused erosion such as dredging navigational inlets, and it's a never ending battle to keep sand on our beaches.

===message:<br> There are many who think we should let nature take its course; let people build stuff on the beach (if they own it) at their expense. Don't subsidize. Then nature will take care of things with storms and if we don't give big public funding and subsidies of insurance people will abandon these areas after they lose everything!
