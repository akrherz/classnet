be pressure to drill wherever there is oil. As we go into recession 
and unemployment in some indistries there will be pressure to 
relax costly enviro rules. However, we know that American care:
<br>The Majority of Americans are Supportive of Environmental 
Protection 
<br>
 Over the past six years, support for environmental protection and 
regulation has remained high and constant. <br>
 Women continue to be more supportive of environmental 
protection than men, but both are clearly supportive.<br>
 Americans have been very consistent over the past six years in 
their belief that the environment and economy can go hand in 
hand, and four to one reject polarized positions on the 
environment. <p>


And we know they act! <br>
<br>
 Some 90% of respondents to a national survey regularly engage 
in at least 6 of 10 activities to protect the environment-saving 
water, conserving energy, recycling, etc.- with 25% engaging in 9 
of these activities or more.<br>
 Only one person in the survey said he or she never engaged in 
any of the listed activities.<br>
 Fully 28% of Americans volunteer their time for an environmental 
cause. <p>
