===message:I enjoyed your comments! "Mother Nature rules beaches" you write. Sometimes. There are lots of places (Holland for example) where she has been asked to redefine what is her domain (the Dutch have pushed the ocean out of a large % of Holland - successfully so far until global warming raises the level fo the oceans!). It's a matter of whether we want to "control" or cooperate and coexist with the sea. If you look at prices of beach property, you'll see that people want to live right there at the edge of the risk zone! Apparently <b>regardless of the cost!</b>
