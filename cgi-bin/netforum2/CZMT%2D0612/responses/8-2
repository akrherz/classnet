===message:<br> Some say the triangles are a necessary evil - necessary because interest groups do need to have access to their lawmakers and lawmakers need to have oversight over the regulatory agencies and departments they have funded, and the regulators need the good will from interests groups to lobby Congress on behalf of them (the agencies - say EPA, or Army C of Engineers) for more funding since agencies are not allowed to lobby.<br> Evil because underrepresented or unrepresented groups may be left out of this decision making triangle! So the lesson is organize, lobby, and get into the loop of the Coastal Iron Trianges.

===message:A powerful interest group here in Florida for beach restoration projects is the Florida Shore and Beach Preservation Association. The FSBPA functions as a "league of cities and counties" on beach and coastal issues.  Most cities and counties here in Florida are members of this association.  They lobby Fla. legislature and Congress on beach funding.  This association is vital to get local beach projects moving here in Florida.  Many private citizens are also members of the FSBPA.  As I said, the FSBPA is very influential in lobbying.  Also, they are out there educating public officials and the general public on how to deal with coastal erosion.  A good group!
