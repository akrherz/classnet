===message:<br> Wow! you are really strong on this! It is so difficult to weigh human use of nature and environments that are fragile but appeal to people and the need to be good stewards of nature and just stay away!!

===subject:Stop armouring beaches?

===message:I appreciate your argument that we should stop armoring beaches. But if we let nature run its course at this point, not only would the immediate property owners be affected, we all would be affected somehow, either directly or indirectly. As prof. Schmidt writes in his class overview, over 80% of the U.S. population lives within an hours drive of the coast. The reason is, everyone wants to enjoy what the coast has to offer.  I, like you, would like to see zoning to prevent future development along beaches, especially on barrier islands. Thanks for sharing your thoughts:)
