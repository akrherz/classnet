===message:<br> You are right when you say that "Environmental 
groups even had a major role in shaping many 
environmental bills enacted in the early 70'". I think that 
was a good thing. However, when oil companies have 
a role to play when government formulates an energy 
policy (as has happened in the Bush/Chaney 
administration) we don't like it. Double standard?<br>
