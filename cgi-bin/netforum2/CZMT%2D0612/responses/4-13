===message:Hats off to Ian,
<br>
I personally though your comments were great.
<br>
Near the end you mentioned "real life viability" and I think this is the most important issue regarding many "traditional rights".  The problem as I see it is that viability is often the only critera that the public, the gov't and the tribe members rely on for their particular viewpoint.  Just because you can do X doesn't necessarily mean that you should do X and just because you do not doesn't mean that you should loose your right to do either.
<br>
I think this is often overlooked and is one of the things that causes problems.  Once the Makah tribe's whaling stoped then everyone against whaling automatically claims that it does not have to occur again.  And at the same time the tribe must continue to perform their tradition in order to keep their rights to do so.  The result is "Gross ignorance and incompetance, plus a total misappropiration of tribal rights" when tradition does occur.
<br>
This is just personal opinion but I see it all the time here in Alberta.  Natives have these rights and they feel that they must exercise them or loose them.  Only bad things happen when this situation exists.
<br>
It seems to me that the problem is that society has lost the idea of enough.  We are never satisfied and go as far as the law and society will allow.  And additionally there is too much input and to many interests and this often blows issues out of proportion.  This is true with the Makah tribe, to a degree.
<br>
Just some thoughs,
<br>
Allan

===message:<br>So, how do you <b>really</b> feel about this!?<br> I liked 
your comments not only because you are well informed here 
(having done a paper) but ebcause <b> passion in one's analysis 
</B> is not  bad thing. Actually, when we feel strongly we often dig 
deeper into our intellectual pool of material! Your comments, of 
course, are right on the money too in terms of the trade-offs. And 
yes there are some enviro's who go over the top. Good job!

===message:<br> Good point re --- "This is just personal opinion but I see it all 
the time here in Alberta. Natives have these rights and they feel 
that they must exercise them or loose them. Only bad things

"pushing the envelop" in society in general. In the US we are very 
sensitive now to "rights" of every group. The idea that we <b>
collectively</b> decide what is right and wrong is challenged 
constantly by those with what we call <b>parochial rights</b> or 
sub-culture positions (whether it's the native people or the 
environmentalists - both of which disagree with the norm!). Good 
observations Allan.

===message:Is this Ted Kendziora or "Ted Nugent" that posted this message?  Great comments Ted.  Being from the mid-west, I have family members that hunt and trap for recreational purposes.  When fur prices peeked in the 60's and 70's, hunting and trapping was a 2nd income for them.  Now that prices have dwindled to practically nothing, they still get the same amount of enjoyment out of the sport.  I hope you're not offended by the Ted Nugent comparison.  The "Nuge" is a favorite of mine, (wow, I guess I just gave away my age here).  Again, great comments Ted!
