===message:<br> So, how do you <b>really</b> feel about beach remourishment!? Many decades ago the shore and the sea were seen as frightening places and people did not want to live there. Now we have glamourized the shore (look at commercials and you'll see many galmour ads on the beach w. sunset). Is there any way we can slow the armouring? Yes, and you will read some interesting ideas in Against the Tide.

===message:There are many restrictions for placing sand on a beach.  Even the time of year a beach nourishment project takes place can be influenced by different laws and regulations.  For instance, if a proposed action may adversely affect an endangered species, then there are FWS or NMFS terms and conditions that must be adhered to.  On some south Florida beaches, for instance, sand cannot be placed on the beach during sea turlte nesting season (May - Oct.).  Some larger beach projects that take months to complete may not be finished until early spring, immediately before hurricane season.
