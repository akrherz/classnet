===message:First, extinction WAS a natural process until mankind helped out. Most extictions that happen daily are indeed insects and plants that are eliminated mostly through human interference like denuding tropical forests.<p> Second, I do not beleive that you would thrust that harpoon into the last remaining whale of a species, nor do I believe that you would condone the killing if you had the power to stop it. At a certain level the rights of a species superceeds the rights of a people or individual. This is what I half jokingly referred to when I wrote that some tribes had  for hundreds of years scalped their opponents, but we would never entertain resurrecting that tradition, nor would any of the current tribe members (I hope). (Next time you're in New York, check out the scalp and shrunken head collection at the Native American Museum)

===message:Do you have any knowledge of the relationship between the Canadian Govt and some of the native tribes there (Iroquois or Mohawk). Wasn't there some kind of conflict there a few years ago? What about hunting and trapping or fur trading and that kind of stuff. I really have no knowledge of the situation there. Can you help explain it?

Some thoughts:
You said: First, extinction WAS a natural process until mankind helped out. 
<br>
Humans are part of the environment and I am not sure that humans make it unnatural.  We just change it drastically but you can't (I think) address issues in such a way that it is the environment on one side and humans on the other.
This is the problem in the first place is it not???
<br>
Also the comment about the "last whale" was designed to draw attention to the issue of species sustainability and viability.  Although we might be able to keep certain species from beconming extinct I am not sure we should if the population is not viable to sustain itself in the world at that particular time.  Even if we were/are the case and it might be viable in the future.  Extinction in all forms is natural and I would rather have a species go extinct that just have a few scattered in the wild, or preserve some "representitives" in zoos.  Now I am not saying active elimination I just mean we often do things for the sake of preservation with no other purpose beyond existance.
<br>
Also you said that "At a certain level the rights of a species superceeds the rights of a people or individual":  I flat out disagree with this.  Maybe that is just the anthropocentric inside me but I feel strongly about this.
<br>
Otherwise thanks for writing and remember most of the time its just opinion in general and as you pointed out when it comes right down to it I probrably would act differently or maybe not.
