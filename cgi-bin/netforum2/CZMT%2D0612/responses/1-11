===message:<br> What great comments and so true! People LOVE the coast and will take 1,000 risks to be there. I think you are correct in that we have much better forecasting and also very extensive evacuation and safety procedures now. (Of course, New Orleans is below sea level and if the levees break New Orleans is likely to be toast!!). It is a matter of figgering out how to play with fire (build on the beach) without causing excessive risk and cost (especially to the average taxpayer). It's like drugs or cigarettes - may be dangerous but keep doin' it!
