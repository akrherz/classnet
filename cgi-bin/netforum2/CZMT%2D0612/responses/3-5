===message:<br> I like your comments. I also lived on Long Island, in Southampton (East Quoag) and I know how the Long Island dunes and beach community plays. Of course there are places like Holland where they have not just armoured but actually pushed the sea back, so our wimpy control of the sea is not the Cadillac of this process.! :-)  However, we do have home owners associations and it would be great to have them understand that crime, gated communities, and the usually rich people problems are less important than the interfact between homes, beaches, ocean, wind and tide.
