There is the case of the Sea Pines Deer on Hilton Head Island, SC. There is a large population of deer causing problems in a gated plantation community called Sea Pines. They are eating the landscape in front of million dollar homes. They are really consuming alot of vegetation on the isalnd because they have no natural predator. The deer can migrate from island to island to mainland. Homeowners are putting up wire fences where permitted by the association. Others are buying expensive sonar to keep deer away or other gimick devices. Some are endagering the entire community by shooting deer. There are bumper stickers on cars reading "Save the Sea Pines Deer". The homeowners which are 35% full-time residents and 65% part-time residents are split between what to do. One solution presented by the state was to have the University of South Carolina come in and do migratory research on the deer. Tagging the deer and moving them to a unihabited island or part of the mainland to see if they returned. Most have accepted this solution.

I believe citizen groups can make a difference.  I believe as individual, we can all make a difference everyday in how we treat our environment.  On a personal level, every day I feel I have made a difference in a positive way to our environment.  I'm far from being an activist, "tree hugger", or extreme environmentalist.  But I do respect the earth and living a nice healthy life.  I don't spend hours and hours on an environmental cause, but I choose to make my
lifestyle "environmentally friendly".  Each small step I
make daily gradually adds up to something big.  I
believe we can all make small changes to the way we
approach things we do every day.  These small things add
up, and they will make a difference to our environment.
We have many opportunities around us, we just need to
tune into how we can help make a difference.
