===message:<br> Interesting. Do you really think that Key West (or the Keys in general) can be evacuated if a fast storms turns and comes in? I am very doubtful - one road and a growing number of permanent residents.!! I have now abandoned my search for a place in Key West for precisely that reason. And as you know, the coast is the fastest growing area in the US. People (like Lemmings?!) are swarming to the shore. we need to have a significant talk about how to make them safe (and also protect the environment from these hordes!).

===message:No, I don't think the Keys would be able to evacuate in time if a storm turned very quickly. I meant to make the point that even somewhere like the Keys, which seems to have so many restrictions and hurricane preparations, a disaster could still strike. What fascinates me is that people are still trying to find ways to develop more land down there to bring more people in, which would jam things up even more! It's a good thing you are no longer looking for a place in Key West!

===message:<br> Gotcha! I agreee. I am like so many of us. We really love the raw, wild, and slightly dangerous places along the coast. Maybe if we cut most subsidies and let people just take a personal risk with their property (no insurance subsidies!) they will stay away!
