===message:<br> your discussion was very interesting because it raises the question of how state and local Coastal Triangles overlop with federal ones. I have never seen research on that and it is an interesting (and I would guess very complicated) research problem. <br> your anchovy example was interesting. <br> Remember that the triangles are not closed  - anyone who's organized, focused, and determined can get in on that. Developers and the insurance industry are another example of Coastal Iron Triangle interests. remember that Congress is huge and there is room for several Coastal Triangles on differemt issues (insurance and development; coastal anti-terrorist issues; fisheries and conservation; recreation industry (reef preservation etc.).
