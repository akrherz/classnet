It appears the Bush Administration is targeting the Endangered Species Act too, with a Bill to amend the ESA to limit the application of the Act with respect to actions on military land or private land and with respect to plants.

Hansen Files Landmark Bill to Restore Original 

Intent of ESA

Exempts private property, military lands and all plant life from ESA


  
Retiring House Resources Chairman James V. Hansen today filed a bill that would exempt military lands, private property and all plant life from the Endangered Species Act.


Hansen called the bill "a shot across the bow from a retiring chairman" and a blueprint for bold changes that reflect what Congress originally intended when it passed the law more than 30 years ago. "I'm just greasing the wheels for change here, giving my colleagues something they can act on swiftly in the next Congress," Hansen said.


Growing problems with the ESA cost consumers and taxpayers more than a billion a year in litigation, lost profits, lost jobs and rising operating costs for both government and business, according to estimates from private groups. 


In some instances, private property owners can't walk their own property. Some military bases can't use their own land for mission-critical training at a time when America is on the verge of war.


Chairman Hansen's statement:  
  
"After working with this law during my 22 years in Congress, I've concluded it's the most powerful law in the land. It can be used to thwart everything from the training of our fighter pilots to the farmer's simple desire to plant a crop in his field so he can feed his family.


"Right now, in this country, the rights of an endangered fly or a species of seaweed take precedence over national security, commerce and many people's right to the enjoyment of property and the pursuit of happiness.


"Our founding fathers would be appalled.  This government was founded on a few key concepts, among them the need to provide a common defense and the protection of individual property rights. These days, ESA is tripping up even that.  This legislation moves the federal government in the direction of working cooperatively with private landowners.  Under current law, the only option to protect endangered species is legal confrontation.  


"Congress crafted this law nearly 40 years ago to protect large species like the grizzly, wolf and bald eagle from extinction. Frankly, the ESA hasn't done a particularly good job of protecting anything but lawyers' pocketbooks. Outlawing DDT did more for our wildlife than the ESA has done. 


"Meanwhile roads have been stalled, homes lost, countless jobs forfeited and thousands of acres locked up because of this ham-fisted law.  Republicans and Democrats have long recognized that something needs to be done to fix the Endangered Species Act. I'm just making it easy for everybody next year by dropping a bill now with the three simple changes that could fix this law. 


"If we exempt private property, military lands and all plants from the ESA, we would, in short order, have a more prosperous and secure nation and still have a healthy and abundant wildlife. We would create thousands of jobs, jump-start our economy, free up our clogged court system and still protect our wildlife. 


I'd wager my federal pension you could make these changes and the populations of threatened and endangered species would remain the same. The numbers didn't improve when we started stripping people of their rights. I doubt they'll go down any once we restore those rights."

===message:The times have changed since our forefathers. Population is one hundredfold from those days. Private property and fences have replaced open wilderness. There are fences everywhere you look. I even use underground fences to keep gophers out of the garden. I wish I could find a statistic of private versus public acreage lands. I do not think any species but ours understands the theory of private property. That is exactly the kind of attitude that put us in this precarious position in the first place! And they say the media is liberal.

now we are arguing about the degree of this or that! There was a 
time when there was no regulation  of these emissions. in China 
and India (terrible polluters and not covered by Kyoto treaty) the 
pollution from these sources is a true disaster. <br> When jobs 
become more scarce and companies are going broke the 
politicians (and maybe workers and the public) will relax some 
rules.<br> however, today the Feds announced tougher 
emmission standards for SUV's!<br> 
Stay tuned ... there will be back and forth on this for the next 25

===message:<p> tempers are flaring all over the country over some 
of the Bush policies (logging, logging roads, emission 
standards for particle emmissions from power plants, 
oild/gas drilling, to name a few). I think we need to look 
at the details and see if there is a wholesale turning 
back of standards or just an adjustment (a correction) 
of the laws. I think there is a difference. <br>My view is 
that environmental law is pretty "settled" which means it 
will not go away or be eliminated. But there are 
<b>details</b> which will be adjusted by each 
administration and depends on the "mood of the 
country" at any given time. <br>
