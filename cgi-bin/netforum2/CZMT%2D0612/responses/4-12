===message:I though your post was right on Yvonne and I tend to feel the same way, in general, about the issue.  I try not to get to exited about environmental issues because that is how things get blown out of proportion.  I think the isssue is important to examine but it is not that important compared to other issues, at least for me.

This is where scale comes into the picture.  Depending on your closeness to an issue your response varies. Your personal response is between MI and MIN response options or at either extreme--it all depends on your particular situation.

P.S. MI and MIN are now used by yours truly for a whole bunch of things--how much candy to hand out, development, personal responses, description of auto accidents etc.  thanks Dr. Schmidt!!!
