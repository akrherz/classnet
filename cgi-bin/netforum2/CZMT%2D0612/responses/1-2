===message:<br> Good description. Hard armour comes in a variety of forms. There are, of course, massive sea walls that have been in places for hundreds of years (I/ve seen them in Europe and Latin America). There are wimpy hard human barriers that get washed out in severe storms. There are the Dutch dykes and  pumps that have claimed much of coastal Holland from the sea (and hold up quote well). So, it all depends on what you do.. <br> Then there is the issue - should we mess up coastal nature so severly and that's more an ethical than a technological question (and one we need to discuss in this class too!!)
