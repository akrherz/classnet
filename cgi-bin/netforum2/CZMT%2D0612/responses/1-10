<br>I like your comments and especially the personal examples you have! I lived in Florida from 1960-64. in thsi days we celebrated storms, risk, and we were not so cencerned with personal safety and certainly not with <b>liability!</B> <p>
Of course Louisiana coastal and Mississippi delta has always been an unstable are unsuitable for long trem living by humans. It's like Bangladesh!! A rain infested lowland area that will be submerged under the sea when the ocean levels rise 12 inches or 24 inches! (I'm in a very pessimistic mood today).

My paper is going to be about ( and this is very rough) the importance of educating people about shoreline ecosystems and development. Be cause when you only see the "beach" once a year ( or so ) you don't really notice or understand that the changes are natural... In the midwest/ in shore anywhere / the very "ground" you build on doesn't change perceptably in the short run, earthquakes excepted.  So the changes you notice are farmland becoming residential or commercial etc. <br> At the shoreline the changes are because of the constant (losing?) battle with the natural systems.
<p>
Because decisions about shoreline development, off-shore development, disater relief etc. are more often than not decided if not defined at a national level, if the constituency is not somewhat informed, then too few people can make decisions that MAY be in the national interest... or maybe not. 
<br>
Any suggestions?
<br>
Thanks <br>

===message:<br> The education of people on the true nature of the shore (a "living" entity that moves, breathes, and changes constantly) is important and done very poorly if at all. I do think that the Mississippi (way up in Iowa even) is very similar to the coast - it has been dammed up with levees, embankments, locks, and all kinds of human barriers. When it rears up it, like the coastal areas and the dunes that need to move, breaks out and smashes all the towns, farms, and other human buildings in the way. So, there are analogies - but we need to examine ways of informing the public (and kids especially) better.
