===message:This is a perfect example of western water management (well, it might be).  Attack the water resources til nearly the point of no return, then lay off.  Just when the environment thinks that things might be getting back to normal, hit them again with the big drain.  Hopefully Mono lake will be spared this fate.  Unlike the Colorado.
