Although this sounds like a global warming song it also says that 
the mood and challenges of each period in which we live (the 
"times") do determine what we focus on as priorities.<br>
Terrorism, smallpox plagues, nuclear weapons, are so compelling 
that I assume they will dominate our agenda for a few years. 
However, even with Vietnam in the 1970's we still made coalitions 
to pass environmental laws and address the problems of the 
coastal areas and oceans so i am somewhat hopeful that we can 
still make that case!
