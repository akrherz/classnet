The problem is we, almost without exception, overdo it.  Everywhere I have gone there are tourists with few exceptions.  We have to be careful with tourism.  Often it is even more damaging than what it replaces.
<br>
Just a cautionary note but I do agree.  I would much rather deal with the problems tourists cause.  I would sleep better anyway.
