===message:<br> I was really interested in your analysis of armour and the use of armour in strengthening coastal/beach areas. In most of the world the sea shore and coastal areas are VERY important to the social and economic life of communities. Although we would, ideally, like pristine and un-armoured beaches/coasts the <b>reality</b> of history is that humans are part of the mix of life on earth and, like invasive species, we are part of the "environment". But, it is a difficult and very political problem!

===message:Hi people!  I am new to classnet and I was looking over you comments regarding this issue.  I thought all the comments were great and wanted to comment myself.
<br>
It seems to me that the entire issue rests on our ability (as communities, even nations) to have some sort of plan of action on what we really want to occur regarding outr beaches.  I think people generally assume that individual members of society want to protect beaches and just the environment in general. I am not to sure this is the case when it comes right down to the actions that need to be taken.  I disagree that the problem really "remains in the poor planning and lack of thought in the previous development of coastal areas".
<br>
I think that in general we really have at least an idea of what is going to happen and the consequences that will result.  The fact is people value the environment a certain amount just as they value the location that they live in, their right to vote, right to pursue happiness etc.  It just so happens that while people have these viewpoints when you tralk to them when it comes time for action the viewpoints change.  It is a matter of giving up one thing to get another (living location for beach health and stability for example).  I truly feel that people think that somehow and someway they can have their cake and eat it too.
I know it seems rather dreary but I think it's the truth in many ways.  Coastal policy issues seem to have a crux that is linked to our motivations above all other things.  We like to be limited in timeframe, money, politics and especially means and technology if possible.  This way we don't have to address our real fear.  The fear that I might have to give up something for a result.  And then do I really want to do it.
<br>
Just thought I would get in on the wonderful discussion.

===message:<br> Your comments are good. People who buy or build on the beach often do not know what the hell is going on out there! They have never taken my Coastal Policy class nor read Against the Tide. So ... they think that it always looks like it does on the day the realton is showing the property. They don't know the beach is "living" and the ocean breathes and "walks" - EDUCATION as well as much, much smarter architecture and engineering. I don't believe that there is very much IF ANY really thinking out of the box thinking going on in the area of seashore construction and radical, environmentally sound redesign!
