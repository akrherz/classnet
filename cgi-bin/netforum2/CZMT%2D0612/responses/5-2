===message:Good information about something that most of us are 
not very conversant with! The problem with everything is 
that it is a sport or a business or a rite of passage only 
so long as there are not too many people doing it. 
When the hordes decend on any area of land or 
species it becomes an extinction and destruction 
dilemma so in moderation things are ok but there are 
too many of us coming down on a static or diminishing 
supply of marine life!
