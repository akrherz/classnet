===message:<br> Good comments and you are right " ...an utter lack 
of monitoring and warning systems prevented any sort 
of effective evacuation."  But maybe if we were more 
afraid of the beach and coast and went there for a day 
tro swim and play and then left for the safety of higher 
ground fewer people would move to and do the kind of 
damage we are inflicting now!! maybe warnings, 
insurance coverage, and other modern tools are 
encouraging this rush to the shore!!
