===message:<br> Great comments and I love your personal example which adds a good "testimonial" to this question. The big problem we have in the US is that private property is an almost sacred part of the constitutional history of the US. Private property and the "right" to own, develop, add value, and sell products, services, or land, are deeply burrowed into the US culture!

===message:I think short-term thinking is the problem. Officials,<br> landowners, and engineers are looking for quick short-term<br> fixes to keep themselves happy. However, they fail<br> to realize that nature works in the long,long,long-term.<br> A human's life time is a millionth of a second<br> compared to nature's. People need to start <br>looking at their properties from this perspective. <br>Maybe this way they would respect the coast more.<br>
