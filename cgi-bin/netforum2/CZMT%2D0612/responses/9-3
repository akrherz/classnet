===message:<br> It is strange that Nixon, the most reviled president by liberals 
and Democrats, was in fact, also willing to work with Congress 
(Democrats) to put in place the cornerstones of  American 
Environmental law. Maybe there is hope Bush will do same! 
Americans do support the environment in overwhelming numbers. 
<br>
In one national poll we found the following: <p>
· Some 90% of our respondents regularly engage in at least 6 of 
10 activities to protect the environment-saving water, conserving 
energy, recycling, etc.- with 25% engaging in 9 of these activities 
or more. <br>
· Only one person in the survey said he or she never engaged in 
any of the listed activities. <br>
· Fully 28% of Americans volunteer their time for an environmental 
cause.  <p>
