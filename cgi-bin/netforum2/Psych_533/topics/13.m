	The main thrust of the Kuhara-Kojima and Hatano article was that previous knowledge in a certain area enables the student to learn new knowledge in that same area better.
	The Hattie, Biggs, and Purdie article was a study on results on different learning skills interventions.  They studied many different kinds of interventions:  Unistructural, Multistructural, Relational, and Extended Abstract.  Within these there are several thrusts:  attribution, motivation, study skills, structural aids, Feuerstein programs, and memory; near and far.  Then, each has a nature:  reproductive or transformational.  
	After looking at all these studies, the researchers concluded that other than simple mnemonic strategies, learning skills interventions should:  (a)  be in context, (b)  use tasks within the same domain as the target content, and (c)  promote a high degree of learner activity and metacognitive awareness.  In other words, learning and study skills don't transfer well from one subject area to another.  Study skills for a particular subject should be taught along with the context.  The student has to be aware of why and when to use it before s/he can make successful use of it.
	According to the text, there are two systems in which we store knowledge:  the images and schemata network, and the semantic network.  When we think to ourselves there are times that we think in images and the ideas connected to them.  At other times we think in words and sentences in abstract terms.  These two systems don't act independently, but are interconnected and bolster each other.
	There is also procedural knowledge and declarative knowledge.  Declarative knowledge is spelled out step by step.  Procedural knowledge started out as declarative knowledge but has been performed so many times that it has advanced to a state that is "ingrained" or "felt" and very hard to describe.  An example of this:  My kids found a padlock that I had had since I was a kid.  They asked me the combination.  I said I didn't know but I bet my fingers did.  I picked up the lock and without thinking about it, found the combination.  That is procedural knowledge.  (Even now, as I write this, I can't think of the combination, but I could go to the lock and unlock it.)  When I first got the lock, I had to read the directions and turn the different levels to the correct numbers.  For awhile I had to refer back to the directions.  That was declarative knowledge.  These two networks are also interconnected and work together.  Really, knowledge is not found just in the head.  It is located in relationships throughout the whole self.  It is solidified by repetition and social interactions.
	I teach Art in a system that has only had a formal art program for four years.  There have been two other teachers before me.  The students start taking art classes in first grade.  Some of my students didn't start taking art classes until third grade.  There has been no set curriculum.  Some of my students are very talented, but they all lack a solid foundation in the Element and Principles of Design.
	According to the Kuhara-Kojima article, my students will be better able to learn new applications in art if they have the strong foundation of the Elements and Principles of Design to build on.
	According to the Hattie article, I need to teach the Elements and Principles of Design within the context of art production, using tasks that the students associate with art.  The students have to be aware of why using the Elements and Principles of Design will help their artwork.  According the text, I need to associate images of the Elements and Principles of Design to the semantic knowledge of the Elements and Principles.  Also the use of the Elements and Principles has to move from the declarative network to the procedural network so that the students automatically use the Elements and Principles when they start a work of art.
	To implement these I will:  Show the students good and bad examples of each of the Elements and Principles and lead discussions on what is good and what should be changed.  Have the students make up their own mnemonic strategies for remembering all the Elements and Principles.  They would be more internalized than any I could suggest to them.  Give the students a checklist of the Elements and Principles at the start of each new project.  They would briefly state what in their artwork applied to each.  After that, it is just practice, practice,  and sharing with classmates what they have done and seeing what others have done.  Only with repetition and social interaction, will the use of the Elements and Principles of Design become the procedural knowledge it needs to be.

===message:I think that the art class example is a wonderful example of the importance of prior knowledge in that it highlights the real-life situation of students entering art class with varying entry-level skills.  
<p>
<br>

As Op533 has suggested, the acquisition of Basic Elements and Principles of Design could be taught alongside the acquisition of art-related motor skills, while the students also talk to themselves about what they are doing as they do it.  According to our reading this would result in the automatizing of both these types knowledge as the students begin to practice them over the course of the class.
<p>
<br>

I would like to see Op533 elaborate more on the actual type projects that attach to a particular element or principle of design relating to, say, color.  In this way, I could get a more clearly resolved picture of what a concrete activity might look like.
<p>
<br>

I had difficulty, personally, in identifying which core ideas, aside from procedural and prior knowledge, Op533 was attempting to explain.  A list would have helped me better understand.  Unfortunately, the formatting preferences of Classnet tend to run things together despite the clear efforts of Op533 to describe these core ideas in detail.
<p>
<br>

I do believe I understand one portion of an explanation which I have important.  That portion is the conclusions described as (a), (b), (c).  To use a complex word that connotes simplicity, found Op533’s explanation of the authors conclusions about interventions to be wonderfully parsimonious.  (even elegant)
