 Assignment 6
 Chapter 8
    This chapter concerned a series of learning strategies based on Vygotsky's Sociocultural Approaches to Mind.  Vygotsky believed that thought and speech were intertwined.  He believed that there were four stages of development:  1. nonverbal- basically sensorimotor  2.  self speech- talking to self as learning to speak  3.  egocentric speech- talking out loud about ones-self  4.  egocentric speech- becoming covert and abbreviated rather than out loud.  Parents assist their children by providing assistance on tasks within the child's zone of proximal development- tasks just a little bit harder thatn what the child can do at the moment, but can do with an adult's help.
    Scaffolding- providing assistance at the beginning of a task and gradually lessening support as the students develop competence, untill no assistance is provided and the students are on their own.
    Apprenticeship- has three components:  1.  modeling- experts show how to do the task correctly  2.  coaching- experts watch the students attempt the task and offers hints and suggestions  3.  scaffolding- experts offer support and guidence.  Doesn't offer too much support and lessens it as students gain skill.
     Direct Explanation- begins with teacher explations and modeling then goes to student practice.  Practice is monitered with more teacher explanation as needed.  Feedback is reduced as students gain skill.
     Students are encouraged to apply the strategy by thinking aloud as they work, and discussing when the strategy could be used.
     Natural Classroom Dialogues- students are encouraged to discuss the topic using higher level thinking and making elaborations and inferences.  Teachers are much less in control of the dialogue. 
     These learning strategies fit nicely with the teaching of art.  The first three are handled pretty much the same so I will treat them as one.  Say I am going to teach a class how to create an acrylic painting.  First, I would go over the Elements and Principles of Design to refresh the students' understanding of what goes into a well-designed painting.  Then we would discuss subject matter, which should be something unique for each student because it should be meaningful for each person.  Then I would inform the students about the properties of acrylic paint.  These would all be classed direct explanation.  Then I would demonstrate with acrylic paints on canvasboard how to create a painting.  I would show how to mix paints, how to apply the paint to the canvasboard. etc..  This would be modeling.  Then the students would start their own paintings.  I would wander around the room keeping an eye on their progress.  When I saw students with problems, I would stop and discuss with them what the problems were and give suggestions on how they could fix them and proceed with their paintings.  I would watch for a bit to make sure they got back on track.  This would monitered practice and the beginning of scaffolding.  As the students gained competence in using acrylic paints and began to figure things out for themselves, I would make less and less suggestions, until I was just observing. This would be the end of scaffolding.  As I helped them with their problems I would encourage them to remember how to do things by talking to themselves.  This strategy could also be called an apprenticeship because I am an expert at painting.  My students could check this out by viewing several murals in town that I have done.  We could also move on to creating a mural in the school using the skills that have learned under my guidance.
     After everyone was done with their paintings we would have a critique which would be a Natural Classroom Dialogue.  The students would display their paintings, explain what their goals were (what they wanted to express in their paintings), how they went about achieving these, what were some of the problems they had, how they went about soving them, and how successful they thought their paintings were.  Other students would have a chance to ask questions and/or give alternate solutions.

===message:		Enactment - (Pressley)  is acting out what is to be remembered.  This allows the learner to code the information both verbally (by saying the process or meaning out loud) and through motoric coding (physical memory).  

		Reconstruction -  (Pressley)  remembering something new but with the influence of prior knowledge.  For instance, each person remembers a commonly experienced conversation differently because they have a varying prior knowledge base.

		Elaborative Interrogation - (Pressley)  asking students questions such as WHY this is to be done.... This prompts learners to activate their prior knowledge, and often success depends on the amount of prior knowledge a learner has with the subject matter.  

		Application Questions - (Andre)  asking questions of the student that require them to concentrate on the If .... then situation of the strategy or process.  When would you apply this?  If the finder has Microsoft Word listed, then __________.  

		Notetaking -  (Pressley)  the act of notetaking was discussed, with the research showing that just the act of writing out 3notes2 positively influencing learning.  If the student reviews the notes later, the positive results increase.  

		Proceduralization -  (Pressley)  the learning or procedure has become automatic to the participant.  Very little long term or working memory is required to perform the task.  This is often achieved through a process involving practice, composition (taking a sequence of productions and collapsing them into a single production) and macroproduction (performing as if there were just one procedure rather than a series of steps)

			In the technology classroom, one of the biggest complaints from staff seems to be that they 3didn1t get to try it myself2.  Just watching someone else is not enough.  If the situation (enough computers) warrants, each procedure or process is followed by time for students to do an activity to demonstrate or encode the new information through enactment or 3practice2.  Making this enactment relevant to their situation as teachers is important.  Giving them a business letter to type is not going to be relevant to them.    In cases where there is not an opportunity to practice, handouts and activities to complete before the next class are utilized.
			During the class, I often give a handout on the skill, process, or content of the lesson for students to refer to later when they apply their learning.  Often I will leave out a term or step for the student to fill in.  This frees up the student1s time to work on the technology rather than taking notes, while at the same time periodically directs their attention to the notes and makes them an active participant in notetaking with main ideas and concepts of the lesson.
			Elaborative interrogation and application questions are a main part of lessons.  I often employ the method of talking aloud when going through a process and problem solving.  When asking students questions, having them give not just the answer, but why... and what the situation is that prompted the answer is extremely effective.   When the answer is B, I sometimes ask - When would the answer have been A?  This forces them to reconstruct a situation and relies on their prior knowledge and learning.  This helps them compare various situations and hopefully will aid in making the information more understandable.
			As an experienced user of technology and a teacher, I have to always remember that I have proceduralized many of the situations that I am instructing.  One of the strengths of a good teacher is the ability to remember  ‘what it was like when you didn1t know how1.  Often this is the complement that other teachers make to a technology teacher.  The learners (especially learning teachers) definitely recognize the lack of ability in a teacher if they are not able to de-proceduralize in order to instruct others.

Important Ideas
<p>
1. Semantic Orientation (Depth of processing)
<p>
Source: This idea was presented in Chap. 10, Pressley's book.
<br>
Explanation: During Learning, students' different attention to the task results in different depth of learning per se. If you help students attend to the semantic features of learning tasks and process learning meaningfully, they can use prior knowledge for the current learning so that they are going to learn more and deeper and remember more and much later.
<p>
2. Advance Organizers
<p>
Source: This idea was presented in Chap. 10, Pressley's book.
<br>
Explanation: Ausubel presented this concept first, and then others have reformed it in various ways. Generally, advance organizers are conceived as something that facilitates learning by providing familiar materials to learners as a cue for the current learning. A good advance organizer can utilize learners' prior knowledge related to the present learning task. By this utilization, learners can understand new information more semantically. 
<p>
3. Note-Taking and Learning
<p>
Source: This idea was presented in Chap. 10, Pressley's book.
<br>
Explanation: Notetaking creates an external, long-term record of learning. This strategy increases learning. Also, the review of notes after taking notes may expand learning, too.
<p>
4. Test Expectancy Effects
<p>
Source: This idea was presented in Chap. 10, Pressley's book.
<br>
Explanation: Learners may learn differently depending on their knowledge of how they are evaluated on a test. In order for learners to learn the contents more deeply and meaningfully, a teacher should give learners information saying that tests are asking extensive understandings rather than surface questions. The test demands requiring learners' deep approach to study may promote academic performance.
<p>
Description of Idea Application to My Teaching
<p>
I will teach a listening comprehension class for international students at ISU. The international students, who speak English as a Second Language (ESL), have a difficulty in understanding spoken English. Therefore, they need extensive practice for listening to English. Here, I utilize the above four learning strategies to promote listening comprehension in ESL environments.
<p>
Basically, the teaching unit is composed of two steps: listening to passages and a short quiz asking the main idea and the hidden meanings of the passage. Here, I will use Test Expectancy Effects (No. 4 idea). Before listening to the passages, students are informed that a short quiz will be held right after listening and that the quiz will ask them about the main idea of the passage and inferential questions like 'Why does the author say that…?' or 'What does the passage infer?'. With this information, students will process this listening task more meaningfully and semantically. When they listen to the given passage, they will perform a semantic orienting task concerning with the main idea and hidden meanings of the passage. This deep processing enables students to listen to the passage more accurately and to understand the passage more deeply (No 1 idea).
<p>
In order to help them to understand the passage they listen to, I will present an advance organizer to them right before playing the tapes of the passages. According to Pressley, there are various forms of advance organizers (pp. 243 in Pressley book). I will show pictures summarizing the passage as an advance organizer. For example, if the passage is about how to succeed in college life, I will provide some pictures related to the lives of successful college students. With these pictures, when students listen to the passage, they may understand new information in the passage with more ease (No. 2 idea).
<p>
Also, I encourage them to take a note when they listen to the passage. Through the notetaking, they can outline the contents of the listening passage. And they will use the note for recall of the passage in the following quiz (No 3 idea).
<br>

===message:5a) Keyword Mnemonic. Source: Pressley. Explanation: This is the use of a word that somehow is both meaningful to the learner and carries an association with the word trying to be remembered. Often this keyword is put into the context of a sentence or phrase that helps the learner make the connection.
<p>
5b) Enactment. Source: Pressley. Explanation: In order to improve memory association, learners act out what is to be learned in a physical way that associates the action with what is to be remembered. Works well with younger students and actually can be accomplished vicariously if the person acting is someone well-known to the learner.
<p>
5c) Notetaking. Source: Pressley. Explanation: Writing out on paper ideas and facts presented improves learning. Just the writing alone helps, but review of the notes also helps. This is common knowledge for nearly all college students, but a learned activity in the K-12 schools.
<p>
5d) Automaticity. Source: Pressley. Explanation: A byproduct of practice, this occurs when enough practice takes place that little or no conscious thought is required to perform the action or recall the information. The cognitive explanation of this involves the process of “chunking”, in which a number of originally separate steps are combined into one which facilitates recall of the whole.
<p>
6. Here is a instructional procedure for helping students understand the inner workings of the computer: 
<p>
We would begin with the esoteric language that describes the parts and functions of the computer. Such terms as RAM, ROM, CPU, etc. would be learned using keyword mnemonics in such a way that it would also give some sense of their functions. For example, ROM, which is Read Only Memory  and therefore permanent, might be associated with the eternal city of Rome, whereas RAM, which is volatile memory, might be associated with “rambunctious.” Of course, it would be necessary for the students to take copious notes as I went through all of this labeling process, perhaps listing in two columns the terms and their associated keyword. Later I would give them time to review their lists, probably going through the list of terms myself, reading the term and letting the students each try to bring to mind the keyword associated with it and the meaning associated with that.
<p>
To help the student understand how the computer actually process we would establish the key components - RAM, accumulator, x and y registers, etc. - and assign students to represent each of these “containers”. We would then assign other students to be data residing at first in the memory. Other students would be various simple instructions residing in other portions of the memory. I would explain how to do some very simple operation such as adding two one digit numbers together and the students would act out the procedure, with the instruction/students moving the data students through the containers in the appropriate sequence. Using a number of simple examples we would repeat the process (practice) until the original instruction/students could perform their functions at least semi-automatically. Then we would exchange roles and do it some more. Hopefully, with the ability of students to learn by watching their peers act out the procedures, fewer and fewer repetitions would be needed with each change of roles until the last instruction/students would need very few to move data through the “computer” semi-automatically.

5. Elaborative interrogation.  Source: Pressley.  Elaborative interrogation involves asking "why".  This process causes students to go beyond the simple regurgitation of facts, they must begin to synthesize information.  They must use their prior knowledge and try to make connections between what they already know and what they are learning. The "why" question should allow students to focus on critical information necessary for learning specific content.  
<p>
Example: After a discussion about first aid techniques, that takes place as part of a health unit, fifth grade students will be asked to write a paragraph that states why they feel it is important that students learn about first aid.
<p>
Notetaking.  Source: Pressley.  Notetaking involves writing down what one hears or reads.  What is written then serves as a record for what has been heard or read.  Students take notes to help them remember what was said during a particular class session or what they read for an assignment.  It has been proven that notetaking and reviewing notes improve learning. 
<p>
Example: As part of a health unit, a guest lecturer from the American Red Cross will speak to my fifth grade students about the importance of learning first aid.  Students will be told that the information presented on this day will be a part of their unit test.  In order to help them remember the information, they will be told to take notes on what the lecturer says because it is not presented in their textbooks. 
<p>
Practice with Feedback.  Source: Pressley.  Practice with feedback involves allowing students to practice what is being taught and the teacher offering feedback about it.  Feedback is most beneficial when it allows students to see how their responses are similar or different from the correct responses.  When an error is made, it is especially crucial that feedback encourages students to think about how their answers compare to the right answers.
<p>
Example: After a mini-lesson on when to use commas, students will be given a set of sentences and will be told to place commas wherever they think they belong.  The teacher will walk around and give feedback to the students.  If the teacher notices that an error has been made, s/he will refer the student to specific examples given in the mini-lesson and the student will be asked to compare their use of a comma with those presented by the teacher.  After making the comparison, the student will have to tell the teacher why the comma does not belong where s/he put it.
<p>
<br>
Practice tests.  Source: Pressley.  Practice tests are tests that are given to prepare students for tests to be given at a later time, or simply to evaluate whether or not students are understanding what is being presented.  They improve learning because they give students the opportunity to review material while taking the test and they force them to retrieve stored information.  These things enable the students to make connections between various pieces of material and improves memory.
<p>
Example:  My students will be given a list of vocabulary words that correspond with the unit we are working on.  We will do several activities using these words during the course of the week.  On Thursday, they will be given a practice test to see how well they know how to spell each word and give its meaning.  The tests will be scored and given back to the students.  The students can then use these tests to see which words they need to study before the real test on Friday.
<p>
<br>
Deep and surface approaches to studying.  Source: Pressley.  A deep approach to studying involves making connections to material being learned and material that is in memory.  It also involves trying to grasp underlying meanings.  Surface learning focuses more on simple memorization.  Students usually engage in either deep or surface study practices depending on how their learning will be evaluated.  Some tests require only a regurgitation of facts while others require higher level thinking skills that require connections to be made between what is being tested and prior learning.
<p>
Example: To encourage a deep study approach, I will use project based assessment to evaluate my students' understanding of the material presented in my health unit.  The project will involve them creating a brochure to be distributed to other fifth grade students that explains what they learned during the unit.  The brochure must explain each concept in detail so that anyone who reads it will have a clear understanding of what is being said.  The brochure must also give reasons why knowing these things is important and give examples of how the content relates to students' daily lives.  This will require that students make connections between information and move beyond rote memorization of facts.  This brochure will be creating using "The Writing Center", a software program that students will already have experience using.  They will be given two hours to complete the brochure.  They must work alone and will be told ahead of time what they will be required to do, so that they can start thinking about what they want to include before class time.
