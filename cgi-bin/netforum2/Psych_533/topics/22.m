5a. Intermittent reinforcement. Source: Pressley. Explanation: Reinforcements are more enduring if they are not given every time a favorable response is obtained. By reinforcing a behavior intermittantly people do not develop expectations of constant satisfaction. By spacing out reinforcements people will not give up the targeted behavior so quickly when reinforcements are diminished.

5b. Classroom Management. Source: Pressley. Explanation: The teacher must arrange the classroom environment so that he/she has control over the learning that goes on there yet with the atmosphere being oppressive to the students. Establishment of rules, procedures, routines and expectations all enter into the process of good classroom management. Many of the activities that are part of classroom management involve behavioral strategies.

5c. Self-instruction. Source: Pressley. Explanation: Self-talk is a means by which students can cope with difficulties in the classroom. The teacher generally models this activity by talking his/her way through a problem so the students understands the process. The student can attempt the same kind of systematic verbal approach to dealing with either an academic or behavioral difficulty, first by asking questions and then answering them in ways that lead to mature solutions.

5d. Social Learning. Source: Pressley. Explanation: There are essentially four aspects of social learning theory: 1. Positive consequences reinforce prior actions; 2. People learn by watching others; 3. Expectations of consequences are formed by watching others perform an action. This last assertion is founded on the further claim that the probability of a behavior being adopted is based on the interaction of one’s expectancies of reward or punishment and the value one places on that reward or punishment; 4. Emotional responses are learned via classical conditioning but may be “unlearned” or extinguished through observation.

6. I am teaching students how to design a calendar using a page layout program in the computer lab. One of my main concerns is the behavior of students in this equipment-filled environment. Since each will be working alone at a computer station I need to develop a classroom management approach that facilitates mature behavior and also gives me a comfortable measure control. One means of attaining that is to set up the lab in such a way that I can see all of the computer screens from a central location. This gives me a measure of control over what is being done on the computers. Secondly, I make sure that there is no other software on the computers that would entice students to work on something other than Pagemaker. 
<p>
I employ social learning by having the students watch me model the early activities of the lesson, allowing them to do the same on their computers and experiencing the satisfaction of accomplishing the task I have modeled for them. 
<p>
Once I turn the students loose to work on their own I move around the classroom handing out praise to students as they accomplish certain steps of the activity, careful not to praise them each time they succeed at something. I also let them know that if they get beyond a certain point in their work by break, they can take a little longer one (this would actually be classified under interval reinforcement). 
<p>
Part of the classroom management setup would be peer help. I will instruct the first student in how to use the scanner, with expectations that the second student will sit and watch while the first one completes his/her work. I will also expect students to assist each other when they have trouble. Any student can call on another who is ahead to show how to perform a particular step in the process. In this way students get ongoing opportunities to watch successful behavior. Because this assignment will extend over several days, they will also come to know that they can expect to have additional liesure time if they exceed the task goals before break each day. 
<p>
Both during my instructional component and whenever I am helping students individually I will practice the self-instructional talking aloud so students can hear how I work through problems. When they encounter a problem of their own I will sit down with them and have them talk their way through the problem for me in the same manner. Eventually, it is hoped that this strategy will be employeed as well when the students help each other. And, of course, when I see it being done I will respond with praise - intermittently.
<p>
Finally, from time-to-time when I see a particularly praise-worthy behavior I will sit down with the student and show him/her how to embellish the project with a special effect I haven’t shown others. Hopefully, as students observe this reward for on-task behavior they will take on that behavior as well in an effort to get my help in developing a more unique project of their own.
