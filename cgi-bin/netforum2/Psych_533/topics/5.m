5. Strategies.  Source: This idea was presented in Chapter 1 of the textbook.  
Explanation: Strategies are controllable operations used to complete a particular task.  They are methods for reaching a particular outcome, whether it be finding the area of a square, reaching a particular destination, etc..  Strategies are often chosen on their ability to reach the desired goal, of the user, with maximum efficiency.  
<br>
Metacognitive knowledge about strategies.  Source: This idea was presented in Chapter 1 of the textbook.  Explanation:  Knowing when it is appropriate to use various strategies is crucial.  All strategies do not work in all situations.  Therefore, one must be able to discern what strategy should be used when.  This involves one’s personal ability to know, or be aware of, their thinking in relation to the use of such strategies.

Good information processors live in richly stimulating environments.  Source: This idea was presented in Chapter 1 of the textbook.  Explanation: Good “thinkers” are surrounded by environments rich in language, culture, and that stimulate thought.  Stimulating classrooms would be those in which the teacher encourages the students to explore their environment.  They are ones that encourage students to be active learners and that foster discussion and critical thinking.  This notion fosters the thought that it is imperative that teachers place their students in environments that will allow them to thrive.

Good teachers interconnect various types of teaching.  Source: This idea was presented in Chapter 1 of the textbook.  Explanation: Effective teachers use various methods to get their point across and to accommodate learners with various learning styles.  Depending on the situation and the goal(s) of the lesson, the teacher will use the technique that they feel best suits their needs.  Effective teachers encourage students to work independently, as well as cooperatively.   They serve as facilitators, as well as disseminators, depending on the situation.

6. I am introducing a fifth grade class to the concept of finding the area of various shapes.  To facilitate their learning, I will allow them to ‘discover’ various ways to accomplish this task, after they have worked with a set of given manipulatives.  Their work with manipulatives will involve them trying to find out how much space a piece of 8.5 x 11in. notebook paper takes up, using a ruler and/or a sheet of graph paper.  At first, this is the only set of instructions that will be given to them.  The strategies that they use will be completely up to them.  After four or five minutes, the students will discuss how they went about solving the problem.  As a class, we will discuss the various strategies that were used.  At this point, since this is an introductory lesson, answers will vary.  It is probable that most students will have measured the outside of the paper, which is the perimeter.  
	I will explain (direct explanation) the students on the difference between area and perimeter and ask how their strategies for solving the original problem would change. I will also state how different units can be used to define area.   Eventually students will come to realize that there are various ways that this problem can be solved.  In cooperative groups, they will work to figure out as many of these as possible.  
	As a class, we will discuss when each of the strategies could be used and why it is sometimes more efficient to use one over the other depending on the situation (metacognitive knowledge about strategies).  This will then lead us into a discussion about the actual formula that can be used.
	By having students discover various ways that area can be found, I have placed them in an environment that fosters their creativity and critical thinking.  This is enhanced by the use of discussion and manipulatives.
