5.  Most Important Ideas

A.  Theories of How Knowledge Can be Represented and Organized in Long Term Memory.

•	Connectionist Theory:  McClelland and Rumelhart in Pressley, 1995
Children build connections between features and nodes.  As the child sees the feature and learns the learns what is it, (s)he makes the connection and therefore learns to identify the things by their connections.  

Ex.  The children are assigned a word list at the beginning of the school year and will be tested on these words in December.  The parents are to go over the words with the child emphasizing the features of the letters and the sounds associated with the letters.  According to the connectionist theory, after doing this for 3-4 months the child should recognized the words when they are in other text forms such as stories test etc..  Seeing the words, hearing them said and seeing the letter features will allow them to make the connection.

B. Concepts:  Pressley, 1995
A decision rule for deciding whether an item is a member of a particular category.  Concept connections are stored in long-term memory. The two most researched approaches in how to classify concepts: 
•	Classical Theory which states that for an item to qualify as a representation of the concept, it must possess the necessary features of that particular concept or group.  
EX.  In a science class of fourth graders we will classify animals into groups according to their characteristics (mammals, amphibians, etc.) The children must identify which features are necessary to be classified in each group and they will learn the concepts of animal classifications.  In order to do this they must know the anatomy of such animals
•	Prototype Theory: states that people relate concepts on the bases of resemblance rather than the defining features.  (Rosch's family resemblance theory.   
EX:  This same class may use the pictures of the animals and their features to determine their classifications.  

C. Frames,  Scripts and Schemata
•	Frame Theory (Minsky (1975)  states that in each frame data is organized representing a certain  situation.  Several types of information is attached to each frame.  Top level frames are fixed, and represent things that are usually accepted as truth about the situation and the lower frames are like openings that can be filled with information about specific things of the event.  The theory represents how the mind can orderly process and store knowledge.
•	Script Theory (Schank and Abelson) states that much of our knowledge  is represented in scripts that captures events more thoroughly than frames.  Since there are reoccurring events in our lives (scripts), if they are changed or defied it is quite noticeable.  When the scripts are activated, the normal routine is resumed,  things seem normal again. 
•	Schema Theory (Anderson) states a series of propositions capturing an event and helps you to keep it in your long term memory.   Activating schema affects comprehension, inferences, attention allocated  and memory of what is read. 
Example Unit:  Every Thursday the first and second graders go for a walk from school to the lake, each time using the same path.  During each walk they discover new things along the path such as the leaves changing for seasons, the birds living under the train tracks and tunnel, the buildings they pass etc..  Using the frame theory, the top frame represents the student knowledge that the starting point is the school and the destination is the lake and that their are certain things like buildings that will be there when they walk.  The lower frames represent the things they do  and discuss along the way.  They stop to identify trees and flowers, to discuss safety when crossing the streets, to yell and hear their echoes in the tunnel while the teacher explains what echoes are and how they occur, and they will sing songs as they walk.  As they walk on a specific Thursday, one of the of the streets they usually take is closed off for construction and the teacher takes the detour.  Many things are no longer familiar to the children and they are confused and looking to the teachers for explanations.  According to the script theory, the children need explanation of why they suddenly chose a different route to the lake because the scripts they have of the normal route have been violated.  They are confused until they reach a point that puts them back on the path they usually walk and the teacher explains why they had to detour, Then the rest of the walk and activities are familiar again.  	Another day during reading time, the teacher reads the book Happy Birthday Moon to the class.  In this story the Bear thinks that the moon is talking to him because his voice echoes each night as he stands on the mountain and yells to the moon.  The schema theory would apply because as the students listen to this story they would activate their schema (or their knowledge of) echoes and their experience listening to their own echoes which would improve their comprehension of the story, capture their attention more and help to remember it.  This schematic knowledge will be used to process the information of the story.  Each student will have a schema for what an echo is, but they each have specific memories of what their individual echoes sounded like.
