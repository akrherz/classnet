5.  Most important ideas:
a.  Semantic versus Episodic memory.  
Source: 
	This was presented in lecture, and in Chapter Three of Pressley.  
Explanation:
	Semantic and episodic memory are two different ways to classify declarative knowledge.  Semantic memory involves knowledge of the world, independent of the individual1s specific experiences.  Episodic memory is memory of events experienced by the individual.  A majority of our most important knowledge is tied to the situation in which that knowledge was acquired, making much of human thinking episodic in nature.

b.  Schema Theory
Source:
	Pressley, Chapter Three
Explanation:
	A schema is a chunk of information stored in long-term memory that specifies the interrelationships between concepts.  Schemata can guide attention.  The schemata that are activated when attempting to remember something tend to have an impact on what is remembered.

c.  Mental Models
Source:
	Pressley, Chapter Three
Explanation:
	As people process the world, they construct a mental model of what they are encountering.  Each encounter with the world activates 3productions2 that contribute to the mental model of the situation.  There are also productions that specify associations to things encountered.

d.  Content Knowledge and Learning Ability
Source:
	Kuhara-Kojima and Hatano, 3Contribution of Content Knowledge and Learning Ability to the Learning of Facts.2
Explanation:
	General knowledge in a particular content area greatly facilitates the learning of facts in that content area.  This appears to be because learners have a context in which to place the facts, making recall easier.

6.  
	This week1s readings point to the fact that we need to make learning 3real2 for students if we expect them to actually gain and store knowledge. 
	My hypothetical learning situation is a middle school science class.  Today1s lesson is on the planets in the solar system and their order from the Sun.
	We1d begin by reviewing what we know about the Earth-Moon system so far.  Next, I1d question students about other planets they know about.  Reviewing the general knowledge students already have in the content area should help facilitate the new factual learning in the area.
	Then I1d introduce a mnemonic to help the students remember the names of the planets in order from the Sun.  (My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas )  The mnemonic will help students create a schema for the information, improving recall of the list and order of the planets.
	To help the students create a 3mental model2, I1d use computer technology to help the students visualize the solar system, including the order of the planets and the size of each planet in relation to the others. 
	The final part of the lesson would be to divide the students into nine equal-sized team.  Each team would build a small scale model of their assigned planet.  The goal is to create a model of the solar system for the classroom.  The hands-on involvement in this project should help move the knowledge from the semantic memory to the episodic memory.
