5a. Unconditioned reinforcer vs. Conditioned reinforcer. Source: Pressley, Chapter 7. Explanation: Both are used in Skinner's
theory of operant conditioning. An unconditioned reinforcer is a consequence that is naturally reinforcing, such as food, sex,
affection, or praise. On the other hand, a conditioned reinforcer is reinforcer that does not satisfy any biological need, but has
become reinforcing by being paired with unconditional reinforcers. Examples of unconditioned reinforcers would be stickers
for completing assignments, tokens in a token economy, or grades. Both conditioned and unconditioned reinforcers when
provided after a behavior has been performed will increase the likelihood that the behavior/operant response will be emitted in
the future. 
5b. Differential reinforcement of other behaviors (DRO). Source: Skinner in Pressley, Chapter 7. Explanation: DRO may be
used as an alternative to punishment in operant conditioning. DRO involves reinforcing an alternative and, in most cases,
incompatible behavior to the behavior which the teacher or behavior management technician is attempting to extinguish or
decrease the likelihood of. An example would be reinforcing pro-social behaviors such as sharing toys and getting along on
the playground for a child who has problems with aggression in play situations. 
5c. Self-Instructional approaches to Self-Regulation. Source: Meichenbaum in Pressley Chapter 7. Explanation:
Meichenbaum argues that self-verbalizations are important in the cognitive behavior of children. They serve the purpose of
organizing complex behaviors. Explicit instruction to self-verbalize can help children to self-regulate their behavior, in
particular the inhibition of impulsive responses. 
5d. Social Learning Theory. Source: Bandura in Pressley Chapter 7. Explanation: The basic idea of Bandura's social learning
theory is that learning often occurs as a result of observing others performing behaviors and watching the reinforcement or
punishment others receive contingent on their behavior. Individual learn not only behaviors, but expectations of the
consequences by observing others. 
5e. Neo-Piagetian Theory of Development. Source: Case in Pressley, Chapter 7. Explanation: Case argues that practice frees
up space in short-term/working memory for the learning of more complicated tasks. Case believes that instruction should start
with a task that the child understands and can perform. Children should be made aware of how they perform these tasks and
be allowed to practice the tasks until they become automatized. Gradually, the teacher should increase the task demands
being careful to make sure that the demands of the more complicated tasks do not exceed the child's working memory
capacity. 
<br>
6. For my application of the key concepts I have chosen from Chapter 7 of Pressley, I will be teaching a social skills class for
sixth graders. I will use the SCORE curriculum which includes five microskills: S-sharing ideas, C-complimenting others,
O-offering help and encouragement, R-recommending changes nicely, and E-exercising self-control. To avoid overwhelming
the students and allow time to practice and master the skills, the classes will be spread over a seven-week span with one
hour-long class being held per week. The first week will be a general introduction to social skills and the necessity to learn
and use them in a variety of settings and situations. The next five sessions will each involve instruction in each of the skills.
Each skill will be divided into smaller, manageable steps that can be learned in isolation and then put together in a sequence
(Case's theory of development involving working memory capacity). The seventh week will be a summary of the five skills
and role plays that involve using more than one skill at a time. Classes will be limited to 10 students to provide more
opportunities for discussion and active role-playing of skills. Between social skills classes, students will be asked to record
instances in which either they performed or observed others performing the microskill for that week. 
<br>
For the first week, the introduction will include discussion on the importance of social skills and an explanation of the
terminology used in the lessons. Student will also be asked to rate their own performance on the behaviors to get an idea of
their general understanding of the microskills and their baseline use and confidence in performing the microskills prior to
instruction. The rating scales have proved useful in helping children reflect on their own behavior and become aware of areas
of both strength and weakness. Lastly, the instructor(s) will model an example of each of the microskills to give students a
frame of reference for the direction of future instruction. Additionally, students will be asked to look at both the verbal and
non-verbal (SEE- Smile, Eye contact and Expression) actions that make up social skills. 
<br>
The classes on the individual microskills will include an introduction to the skill, a modeling by the instructors of the skill, and
an analysis of the component skills and actions that make up the microskill. Students will be directed to look at both the
verbal and non-verbal components of the microskill. Students will discuss a variety of situations in which using the skills may
benefit them. Additionally, students will pair up and do role plays of three different situations in which they may use the skill.
Students will role play for each other to model the microskill and will be encourage to self-verbalize the steps involved. Role
plays will be followed by a review of the component skills used, in which students will identify the component parts of each
skill. (Meichenbaum's self-verbalization). 
<br>
Between class sessions students will be practicing the microskill of the week, along with recording instances of microskill
performance. In particular, children will be encouraged to self-verbalize the component steps of the microskill as they perform
the skill Classroom teachers will be encouraged to model (application of social learning theory) the microskills and point out
to the class when each skill has been used by a classmate (use of praise as a unconditioned reinforcer). Additionally, the
classroom teacher may set up a reinforcement system or token economy that rewards performance of the microskills in
collaborative instructional groups. Students may get sticker, candy, or additional free time for exhibiting social skills in class
(use of conditioned reinforcers). The teacher may also want to provide verbal feedback for students who do not use
microskills. This feedback would include call to the students attention instances in which one or more of the microskills may
have been appropriate and modeling an appropriate social response, using the social skills. By reinforcing pro-social
behaviors and calling to attention behaviors that are not pro-social, the teacher is increasing the use of social skills through
DRO and decreasing negative behaviors.

You do a very nice job of explaining the ideas you choose to emphasize. You create a nice scenario. One idea to consider:
Pressley's ideas about learning strategies may relate to social behaviors. One of the things that needs to be done in teaching
strategies, is to make the strategy overst so that it can be observed and modeled. One of the things that socially deficit
children may need is modelling of what are normally covert processes. How does a good social skill person decide what to
do? It probably has become automatized in you, but what kinds of thinking might you have to have had to go through.
Perhaps these thinking processes need to be modelled.

important mechanism for cognitive growth according to Piaget. When a situation occurs that destabilizes a belief we have (or
causes disequilibration), there is cognitive conflict. This motivates us to find a way to reconcile the new information or situation
with the beliefs we already have. The resolution of the cognitive conflict produces a new equilibrium. 5b. Cognitive Conflict.
Source: Pressley and lecture. Explanation: A state that occurs when the cognitive structures that had been perceived to work
are no longer perceived to be adequate. This triggers a process that often results in the construction of new cognitive
structures that help eliminate the conflict and brings us back to a state of equilibrium. 5c. Distinctive Features: Source:
Pressley and lecture. Explanation: Part of perceptual learning theory. The specific features that differentiate the members of a
class are distinctive only in relation to one another. Gibson1s theory is that adults are often quicker than children at perceptual
learning because their experiences have created an understanding of what to look for and what types of things constitute
distinctive features. 5d. Abstraction. Source: Pressley. Explanation: A basic mechanism of perceptual learning, according to
Gibson. Abstraction is the locating of distinctive features or invariant relationships (relationships that stay the same for a class
of events). 6. I am teaching a basic lesson on plants for middle school students. We begin with discussing what students
already know about plants. As we discuss plant nutrition, it1s very likely a number of students will say they think plants get
their food from the soil, the sun or perhaps water. I'll use a computer animation program to allow the students to do a few
simple experiments to explore how plants get food. As the students manipulate a limited number of variables, they will see that
a combination of factors are needed for plant nutrition. Their previously held beliefs on plant nutrition will likely be
destabilized, and they will experience cognitive conflict. The students will search for ways to produce equilibrium by
reconciling the new information with the beliefs they already have. The next portion of the lesson looks at some of the basic
types of plants. I'll have plants representing a variety of types in the classroom for the students to look at and touch. I'll ask
the students to discuss what features the plants have in common and what differences they see between the plants. This lesson
gives the students an opportunity to discover distinctive features and practice abstraction.

5a. Perceptual Learning Theory. Source: Introduced in Chapter 7 of the Pressley text. Explanation: This theory of learning focuses on interactions "between biologically determined potential and environment". Perceptual learning theory posits that over time, people discover distinctive features of objects or things that differentiate them from other objects or things. We get better at perceptual learning with age- learning to quickly abstract out relevant information.
 
<p>
5b. Disequilibration vs. Equilibration. Source: Introduced in chapter 7 of the Pressley text and in class lecture. Explanation: Disequilibration occurs when information is presented which conflicts with existing schemas or cognitive operations already developed. The individual must then adjust their schemas or cognitive operations so that there is a return to equilibrium- the process termed equilibration.

5c. Assimilation. Source: Introduced in Chapter 7 of the Pressley text and in class lecture. Explanation: The process by which new information is interpreted by or merged into pre-existing schemas or cognitive operations.

Applications Section
 
<br>
I used to work at a residential treatment facility for emotionally and behaviorally disordered adolescents. While there, one of my tasks was to teach a class on drug and alcohol abuse (which a majority of the children there had encountered). When they began the class, many of them believed that drugs and alcohol were a great way to escape their problems, that they could have a good time and free themselves from their oppressive domestic situations and responsibilities. My role was to introduce cognitive conflict in these children, to produce disequilibration (6b) by teaching them about the side effects and drawbacks of
drugs and alcohol. In this way, they could not believe that drugs and alcohol were both a great way to escape and a harmful path toward self destruction at the same time. 
<p>
<br>
The children first had to assimilate (6c) the information I gave them- that alcohol and drugs produce serious harmful side effects to their well being, both mental and physical- in the context of their pre-existing schemas- which conceptualized drugs and alcohol as great ways to escape life's problems. But because this information conflicted with their pre-existing schemas, the children had to adjust or change these schemas through the process of accommodation (6d), in order to return to a state of equilibration (6b).
<p>
<br>
Another one of my tasks as a child care counselor at this children's treatment facility was to take a group of children to an equestrian stable (most of them were from the inner cities) and teach them how to ride horses. The children were introduced to a variety of different breeds of horses and could easily differentiate the horses from other farm animals such as cows. However, they could not detect the differences that distinguished different breeds. Over the several months that they were exposed to these different breeds, the children began to recognize the distinctive features which differentiated one breed from another (i.e. Arabians have slender, dished noses, long bodies, and arched tails; whereas Quarter Horses have much shorter, stockier frames as well as heads). The children had learned to abstract out relevant features and relationships between features that constituted differences between breeds through the process, termed by Eleanor Gibson, of perceptual learning (6a).

===message:1. Apprenticeship -(Pressley, p182) Vygosky's Approach to Mind.  People learn special skills by being around an expert in that field as an apprentice.  It is a powerful approach to instruction that should be used with school aged children to tackle reading, writing and arithmatic.  Situation cognition- Students’ understanding of the concepts they are learning are usually tied to the environment in which they've learn it.  This is a problem because these skills learned must be applied in many other environments.  Learning environments such as schools should be made like the real world so that the learned skills can be applied everywhere.  Apprentices observe others in the field in which they are learning; receive coaching from their mentors; and they practice their task that are expected of them. The components of apprenticeships are: modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration. 

2. Reciprocal teaching-(Rosenshine (1979),  in Pressley, p189)   Instruction of comprehension strategies in reading groups.  Teacher models and explains multiple models understanding what has been read.  Students are taught to make predictions when reading,  question themselves  about the text, to seek clarification when confused and to summarize the content.  The students eventually internalize use of the four strategies in reciprocal teaching an they used them in the student groups as they continuously reason about the text.  The teacher becomes less involved as the students continuously go through this process.   

3. Direct Instruction:  (Duffy and Roehler in Pressley, p193). Content is very important and amount of time spent measures achievement (Rosenshine 1979).  It involves clear specifications  of goals  to the student and allows sufficient time for instruction with continuous, extensive coverage of the content.  Student’s performance is monitored and questions are asked at a level that students can handle them.  Feedback is provided that is academically oriented. 

4. Direct Explanation  (Pressley, p194). Retains many of the best features of direct instruction. It is process oriented.  Teacher models the strategies for children and children model them for teachers with feedback.  Long term transfers occur when instructions  include when and where to use the strategies being taught as well as opportunities to practice the strategies and applying them to many situations.  

EXAMPLES.  To practice and encourage writing in a first and second grade class we use journaling.  Initially, before each session the students gather around the teacher with an enlarged notepad that sits on an easel.  [Direct Explanation Modeling] The teacher begins her journal in front of the entire class.  She begins by asking what the beginning of a sentence should begin with.  (The students remember it should begin with a capital letter.) As she continues she emphasizes spacing between each word, the 3 different forms of the word "to", how to close a sentence with a period which lead to beginning a new sentence with a capital, etc  emphasizing strategies and coaching].   The teachers talks about these rules in writing as if the students already know this and they are just reminding her.  She also allows the students to give feedback to her writing process.  This serves as the students practice piece before they do their own journals.  She talks about how easy it is to come up with something to write because things happen everyday in our lives.  She writes about dinner she had at her parents home over the weekend.  She tells in detail about the meal, the preparation, the dessert, and then leaves it up to the children to guess how the evening ended.  She then explains in detail the strategies (a component in reciprocal teaching) she wants the students to use as they decided the best ending for the story.   They must clearly understand the events of the evening to get to an ending.  They are to answer questions about the story before coming up with an ending.  After this exercise the children began their individual journals.  

[Articulation] The children helps her to spell out "difficult" words (but the kids are using inventive spelling) and the teacher guides them (as needed) to spelling it correctly by adding letters that are missing or misplaced   While adding these letters she subtlely hints or reminds them of rules such as the "e" being silent or that they "y" sometimes has the "e" sound.  

[Reflection and mental modeling] After every few sentences, the teacher reminds the children that it is very important to read [aloud] what you have written after every one or two sentences just to make sure it makes sense.  She does this with her own journal entry.  This allows them to reflect on their writing skills and the writing process.    

[Exploration] After the teacher completes her journal entry, the student retrieve their journal and finds a comfortable place to begin writing.  The students are then allowed to apply the strategies of the writing process and the strategies in the content of their writing to their journal entry.  They are monitoring product as well as process.  The teacher reinstructs and re-explains as needed.

[Reciprocal Teaching] After reading the teachers completed journal, the children join their reading groups to discuss the content of the journal.  One student is assigned the role of group leader in each group and (s)he begins to ask questions about the event.  "What did Ms. E's parents cook for dinner?  Which night did she eat with her parents?  What was for dessert?" Finally to predict an ending to the story, the leader asks "what did they do after dinner?  Together they come up with suggestions.  The leader asks questions after the each suggestion to see if it makes sense or if it is possible.  The teacher walks around listening to each group and answers questions the students have about the process of the assignment.  At this point the teacher is less involved as the students interact with each other.  

[Direct Instruction] For the individual journaling task,  teacher allows children two 45 minute periods so that they may have time to complete each entry.  Teacher understands that at their skill level, it takes much longer for 1st and 2nd graders to write.  This also allows the teacher to have time to give feedback to each student.  Parents come in voluntarily to help students who are slower learners or are mechanically slower in the writing process.  This enables the needs of the children to be directly met.  These students work one on one or 2:1 with a volunteer.  The students who are faster at reading and writing can then begin to create story boards to match their journal entries.
