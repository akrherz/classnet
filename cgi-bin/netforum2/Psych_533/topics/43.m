===message:5.  I would like to discuss the Collins et al.’s Components of Apprenticeship as described in Pressley, Chapter 8. 
<br>
5a.  Modeling occurs when persons with expert knowledge show their apprentices how to do tasks and explain the key steps required.  The expert describes certain actions to the apprentice that are normally automatized for the expert.
<br>
5b.  Coaching occurs while the apprentice attempts a task with an expert providing suggestions along the way.  If, during coaching, the apprentice needs to see another example of how a particular task should be done, the expert can model it to him or her again.  Lastly, coaching is the most prevalent component of apprenticeship.
<br>
5c.  Scaffolding allows the apprentice to perform tasks that are within reach of his or her capabilities. As the apprentice gains skill in a particular task, the expert provides the learner with another, more complex task.  Scaffolding is supported by continual coaching.
<br>
5d.  Once the apprentice can perform a given task, the expert asks that person to explain what he or she is doing.  This requires the apprentice to articulate the process.
<br>
5e.  Reflection occurs when compare their work with that of others as well as experts.  The goal of reflection is to encourage apprentices to improve their own processes.
<br>
5f.  Exploration is the stage during apprenticeship where experts encourage apprentices to become independent through indepent research and exploration.
<p>
6.  An example of apprenticeship could occur in a driver’s education class.  Students would first watch films about driving techniques.  They would also ride around with an expert driver who explains different key tasks. These observations would be considered modeling.
<br>
Once the students have seen modeled examples of safe driving, the instructor would probably coach them through various tasks. The tasks might include first a driving simulation and later an actual driving experience in the car.  During the coaching, the expert would explain what the students did wrong and what the should have done instead. The expert may even conduct demonstrations to model the task after the student has attempted it.
<br>
Scaffolding would occur when the expert starts the students off by driving in a simulation and later in a parking lot. Once the student has gained more control of driving skills, the expert might have them go out to a highway or heavy traffic area.
<br>
Articulation would occur if the expert asks students to describe what they are doing when they plan to change lanes.  Their response might include such actions as checking to see what cars are in other driving lanes, turning on the blinker and rechecking the lanes.
<br>
After each driving trip, the students might be encouraged to talk about what they did well and what they still need to improve on. This stage would consist of reflection.
<br>
Finally, when students receive their driving permits, they must take on the task of learning new things about driving on their own.  These tips would be acquired over time through various experiences. This stage would be called exploration.

===message:5.	Important Ideas:<p><br><p><br>a.	Zone of Proximal Development.  Source: from Pressley, Chapter 8.  Explanation:  This idea refers to behaviors 3beyond a child1s level of autonomous functioning but within reach with assistance2 (p. 181).  This is important with respect to scaffolding.  The proximity of the child1s development to the desired behavior must be close enough or any scaffolding will be insufficient<p><br><p>b.	Apprenticeship.  Source: Pressley, Chapter 8.  Explanation:  This idea has a long history of its own.  It can be explained by describing what and apprentice does.  An apprentice observes, is coached, and practices the skills and knowledge displayed by the more competent senior colleagues.  This allows for transmission of ideas and practices,  both formal and informal.  Collins et al (p.185) suggest that Modeling, Coaching, Scaffolding, Articulation, Reflection, and Exploration are components of such an apprenticeship.<p><br><p>c.	Reciprocal Teaching.  Source: Pressley, Chapter 8.  Explanation:  This idea refers to the removal of support from students as they gradually develop their own competence with subject matter.  This also relates to the concept of scaffolding, in that it is concerned with the timing of the progressive removal of that scaffolding.<p><br><p>d.	Direct Explanation and Direct Instruction.  Source:  Pressley, Chapter 8.  Explanation:  Ideas a, b, c can be applied to both of these ideas and can be used to reinforce the power of both Direct Explanation and Direct Instruction.  Direct Explanation involves just that.  The student is told what to do and then does it, but only if the task is within their zone of proximal development.  Direct Instruction is somewhat different.  In Direct Instruction the goal is to keep the students academically engaged, which is a predictor of achievement.  It involves the clear specification of goals to students.  The behavior of students  is monitored and assessed.  <p><br><p>e.	Instructional Conversations.  Source:  Pressley, Chapter 8.  Explanation:  Instructional Conversation differs from Direct Explanation in its increased involvement of the student in the process.  In one example, the Teacher still directs the learning, but in this process elicits responses in a progressive way by asking questions of the students.  Instructional Conversations also occur in groups of students in class. (Distributed Cognition or two heads are better than one)<p><br><p>6.	Applications:<p><br><p>a.	In order for me to be effective in my instruction of computer skills, I need to assess the proximal development of the student.  This might be done through a pre-test.  In this case, I would leave the parts of a disassembled computer on a table.  I would then assess the development of the student by seeing how they deal with task of the computers assembly.<p><br><p>b.	In this process, the student would be guided by my example and the conversation I would have aloud with myself while modeling the task.  They would observe and listen to my self-talk as they practiced the assembly process.  <p><br><p>c.	As they got the idea, my explanations and hints would become less frequent.  Reciprocal Teaching suggests that the removal of my scaffolding is necessary for the individual to gain confidence.<p><br><p>d.	In certain cases, when the student is having difficulty, I would explain again the function of each piece.  I might also arrange the pieces in the order of their assembly.  But I would withhold some information, in hopes that the student might discover the reasoning on their own.<p><br><p>e.	If the student was still encountering difficulty, I would ask questions such as: Is this mouse some sort of input device?  As I ascertain the student1s level of understanding, I would remind them of a concept that they have already demonstrated, such as connecting the monitor to the CPU.
