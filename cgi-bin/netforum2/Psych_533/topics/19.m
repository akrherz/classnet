===message:5.	Important Ideas
<p>
<br>
a.	Behavioral conditioning, from Pressley text, and from Graubard, Rosenberg, & Miller.  Explanation:  Behavior can be conditioned, that is people can be trained to react to stimuli in a predetermined way by offering rewards (intermittently) for a desired action or behavior. 	
<p>
<br>
b.	Perceptual Learning, from Pressley text.  Explanation:  Learning takes place as a series of more exacting perceptions.  Things are differentiated and better defined over time as exposure to them increases over that time.
<p>
<br>
c.	Classroom Management, from Pressley text.  Explanation:  The teacher’s deliberate manipulation of the learning environment in such a way that it facilitates learning opportunities
<p>
<br>
d.	Self-Verbalization, from Pressley text.  Explanation:  The technique of describing aloud to oneself the steps in a process or the understanding of a concept.  This technique enhances the learning by committing processes to long-term memory as well as automatizing the reasoning behind a process or explanation.
<p>
<br>
e.	Observational Learning, from Pressley text.  Explanation:  People can learn by watching or observing a process or situation.  People have been shown to be capable of avoiding or engaging in an activity dependent upon a previously observed result.
<p>
<br>
f.	Practice or Praxis, from Pressley text and Graubard.  Explanation:  This is related to earlier descriptions of automatization.  The more times a certain activity is performed the less cognitive and physical effort it entails.  Therefore, if a person is to learn a particular thing, many opportunities to practice that particular process or discover that particular bit of knowledge.

6.	Detailed Applications
<p>
<br>
a.	Reward suggestions in computer trouble-shooting activity.  This can be done by taking all examples seriously and evaluating them for their utility.  Particular attention should be paid to not demeaning or degrading in any way the person offering the suggestion.  Over time, this should result in further suggestions as the atmosphere of the class becomes clear.  In my particular unit, all speculations about a particular problem would be held up for discussion.
<p>
<br>
b.	Narrow in on the type of problem to be addressed in computer trouble-shooting by demonstrating a series of errors whose solutions are different yet they share broad similarities.  In my unit I would present two error messages that differ slightly and attempt to illustrate the differences.  This would serve, after a number of similar presentations, by allowing the students and opportunity to build a perceptual experience base upon which to make a diagnosis.
<p>
<br>
c.	Arrange classroom so all monitors face teacher, so that during practice difficulties can be observed earlier and strategies suggested for those not making progress.  As students in my unit send their first e-mail, I would offer suggestions to those who have encountered difficulty and requested help.  For example, a person is unable to enter the message or subject text fields in an e-mail message.  I might suggest they try click with the mouse on areas of the screen to see what happens.
<p>
<br>
d.	Arrange an activity where the teacher first model the set up of a computer by speaking the steps.  Follow this with an opportunity for the students to do the same.  I would demonstrate the entire process of setting up a computer, describing aloud the process and reason for the order in which things are performed.  Groups of students would then reproduce the demonstration with the oral verbalizations intact.
<p>
<br>
e.	Allow students ample opportunity to observe the instructors steps by projecting the teacher’s screen so everyone can see it.  Additionally, give the students an opportunity to observe a sequence of steps that results in failure.  For example, load applications without preferences deliberately induce an unimplemented trap.  Then demonstrate recovery procedures.
<p>
<br>
f.	Continually challenge the students with problems to solve.  Issue assignments that must be delivered electronically such as e-mail, acquiring missing components of software.  Require students to do this with limited or no instructions.  To accustom them to handling such problems both individually, and as a group over a network, encourage collaborative effort to solve a problem.  Establish a web-site for the class, to provide a central location for problems and issues to be discussed.  Start a class discussion thread and build a database of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s)
