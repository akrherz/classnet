Important Ideas

1. Strategies and Age Differences
This idea can be found in chapter 2, Pressley's book.
When you teach students to use strategies, you need to consider the age of your students because not all strategies can be taught to all children. Sometimes, strategies that are good for older students can't be taught to younger children. So in order to ensure that the strategy you try to teach can affect your students learning, the strategy should be selected according to the age of students.  
2. Strategies Maintenance and Generalization
The idea can be found in chapter 2, Pressley's book.
As well as teaching students how to use strategies, you need to encourage your students to continue using strategies in their real learning situation and to transfer the strategies that they learned to various learning tasks. This maintenance and generalization of strategies will be gained when students can get sufficient information about the benefits of using the strategies. 
3. Proceduralization and Working Memory
This idea can be found in chapter 2, Pressley's book.
When learners first use one procedure conducting a specific strategy, they can perform the procedure with a sequence of declarative actions, which demands much working memory capacity. However, with practice, they can execute the procedure automatically and fluently. This movement from a slow step-by-step sequence of actions to a fluent single procedure is called proceduralization, which needs not much working memory capacity. By Proceduralization of a procedure, learners can use more working memory for other tasks. 
4. Short-Term Memory Capacity and Individual Difference
This idea can be found in chapter 2, Pressley's book.
Research shows that each student has different amount of short-term memory capacity. As a teacher, you need to design instruction that considers this individual difference of short-term memory capacity.

Description of Idea Application to My Teaching

I am teaching 4th grade students how to write essays better. There are various strategies that help students write better essays. For example, before formal writings, students do prewriting activities, which facilitate students' exploration of ideas. Another example is to have students revise and edit their writings after finishing their first drafts. Here, I am using prewriting activity as a strategy to write better essays. Among prewriting activities, I think that a 'mapping' activity is the best strategy for 4th grade learners to write better, for mapping helps generating students' thoughts, organizing their writing well, and writing coherently by using learners' verbal and visual abilities. So I choose a mapping activity as a strategy for better writings of 4th graders (Application of No. 1 idea: Strategies and Age Differences). 
The topic of writing is 'The things I like.' Before they make a map for this topic, they will experience how to make a map for generating ideas. They have not yet proceduralized their mapping strategies. This unproceduralized mapping procedure needs much working memory, which should be used for generating ideas for the topic. Therefore, first of all, students should be familiarized with a procedure of making a map: (1) Placing the main idea in the center of their map, (2) Brainstorming supporting ideas for the main idea, (3) Adding the supporting ideas on the extensions, and (4) Adding or deleting some ideas from their maps if necessary. In order to let students proceduralize mapping, I will give some exercises for mapping. The following is one of the exercises.

Exercise 1. Here is a main idea, My autobiography. By using the following map, generate supporting ideas about your life.

---------------

(Imagine the map inserted here. I can't paste a map graphic
on my word document here. Sorry..)

----------------		

Through a few exercise of generating a map, students can perform the procedure of mapping fluently and automatically, and generate writing ideas freely. This proceduralization of making a map helps students to concentrate on brainstorming of ideas (Application of No. 3 idea).

Even though they have practiced enough mapping procedures, some students may have difficulties in making a map, for each student has different capacity of short-term memory. As an educator, I need to consider students' achievement differences caused by different capacity of short-term memory. So I will give them a prompted map that has a main idea and a few supporting idea extensions. Based on the map produced by me, they can use their short-term memory on generating ideas themselves rather than struggling with making a map (Application of No. 4 idea).  

After this class, I encourage students to use this mapping strategy when they write something. For them to maintain and transfer this strategy, I will have a discussion about what are the most advantages of mapping for better writing with students right after finishing writing essays based on their own mapping. This discussion may help them to recognize the importance of using mapping for good writings, so that they can use this writing strategy in their future writing tasks (Application of No. 2 idea).
