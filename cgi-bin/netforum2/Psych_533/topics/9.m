5a. Connectionist Theory. Source: Chapter 3 of the Pressly Text. Explanation: This theory states that a certain "thing" contains properties (features) and each distinct property (feature) is accounted for by a seperate neuron or neural group. Each time the stimulus is presented, the neuron or neural groups which correspond to each of the individual features are activated simulaneously. With each subsequent exposure, the neural connections are strengthened until simultaneous firing of the particular neural configuration results in automatic recognition of the object.

5b. Propositions and Macropropositions. Source:Chapter 3 of the Pressly text. Explanation: Propositions were defined as "things and their properties"- the equivalent of sentences. Macropropositions are not a direct translation of individual propositions verbatim, but instead are the general or main idea(s) derived from the sum of the individual propositions. These are the summaries which get stored in our long term memory.

5c. Semantic and Episodic Memory. Sourse: Chapter 3 of the Pressly text. Explanation: Semantic knowledge is general knowledge about the world and the things in it without reference to specific events, instances, things, etc. Episodic knowledge is that which is about specific events, instances, individuals, etc. Each episodic memory increases semantic memory and semantic memory can be used as a focal point from which to compare individual episodic memories.

5d. Dual Coding Theory. Source: Chapter 3 of the Pressly text and in the class discussion. Explanation: This theory holds that all knowledge is dually stored, that is, each object/ piece of knowledge is stored in both 1. a verbal system and 2. an imagery system. The verbal system stores the word or combination of words , whereas the imagery system stores a nonverbal representation of the object, i.e. its visual image, its auditory image, tactile image, etc. These two systems interact to produce the sum total of the representation of the knowledge stored.

6a. I volunteer as a literacy tutor and GED course instructor. In the literacy program, when a student has trouble recognizing a word, I have him/her practice it over and over in a number of different contexts so that the neural networks activated by the word can form stronger and stronger connections (connectionist theory) until the word is automatized in such a way that s/he can recognize it immediately.
<br>
6b. When teaching reading comprehension, I must first allow the student to read a passage- which is a string of sentences (propositions). When they have completed this task, I ask them to summarize the passage for me. I do not want a recital of the propositions, but rather an interpretation in their own words as to what the passage was about, i.e. the main idea(s)(macropropositions). This level of comprehension only comes about when the word recognitions and their meanings are automatized so that they need not concentrate on the words and the sentenses themselves, but instead comprehend the passage as a whole.
<br>
6c. Many times during the course of tutoring a student in literacy or GED coursework, I ask him/her to write an essay. These essay topics are often general in nature. An example topic might be "Are cars good or bad in the context of our society?" The student must then choose whether s/he will compose an essay which is in favor of, or against, the use of cars and back his/her position with supporting arguments. I instruct the student to tell me about the advantages and/or disadvantages of cars in general, and then to give me examples of how cars help or hinder him/her specifically. For this task, the student utilizes semantic memory in writing about cars in general and episodic memory in writing about his/her own car and/or specific instances wherein a car either was an aid or a detriment to him/her personally.

6d. I utilize the concept behind the dual coding theory when a student has difficulty comprehending , storing into memory, and automatizing a word. For instance, if the student had dificulty with the word dog (this example is for the sake of simplicity), I would not only show the student the word dog but would also instruct him/her to visualize what a dog looks like, sounds like, smells like, feels like, etc. in detail. In this way, the student utilizes both systems (verbal and imagery) upon exposure to the word, which results in more fully comprehending, and more quickly automatizing, the word.
