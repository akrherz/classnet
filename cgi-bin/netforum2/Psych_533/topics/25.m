5a. Perceptual Learning Theory. Source: Introduced in Chapter 7 of the Pressley text. Explanation: This theory of learning focuses on interactions "between biologically determined potential and environment". Perceptual learning theory posits that over time, people discover distinctive features of objects or things that differentiate them from other objects or things. We get better at perceptual learning with age- learning to quickly abstract out relevant information.
<p>
5b. Disequilibration vs. Equilibration. Source: Introduced in chapter 7 of the Pressley text and in class lecture. Explanation: Disequilibration occurs when information is presented which conflicts with existing schemas or cognitive operations already developed. The individual must then adjust their schemas or cognitive operations so that there is a return to equilibrium- the process termed equilibration.
<p>
5c. Assimilation. Source: Introduced in Chapter 7 of the Pressley text and in class lecture. Explanation: The process by which new information is interpreted by or merged into pre-existing schemas or cognitive operations.
<p>
5d. Accommodation. Source: Introduced in Chapter 7 of the Pressley text and in class lecture. Explanation: The process by which pre-existing schemas or cognitive operations are adjusted or changed to fit conflicting information in order to return the individual to the state of equilibration.

I used to work at a residential treatment facility for emotionally and behaviorally disordered adolescents. While there, one of my tasks was to teach a class on drug and alcohol abuse (which a majority of the children there had encountered). When they began the class, many of them believed that drugs and alcohol were a great way to escape their problems, that they could have a good time and free themselves from their oppressive domestic situations and responsibilities. My role was to introduce cognitive conflict in these children, to produce disequilibration (6b) by teaching them about the side effects and drawbacks of drugs and alcohol. In this way, they could not believe that drugs and alcohol were both a great way to escape and a harmful path toward self destruction at the same time.
<p>
The children first had to assimilate (6c) the information I gave them- that alcohol and drugs produce serious harmful side effects to their well being, both mental and physical- in the context of their pre-existing schemas- which conceptualized drugs and alcohol as great ways to escape life's problems. But because this information conflicted with their pre-existing schemas, the children had to adjust or change these schemas through the process of accommodation (6d), in order to return to a state of equilibration (6b).
<p>
Another one of my tasks as a child care counselor at this children's treatment facility was to take a group of children to an equestrian stable (most of them were from the inner cities) and teach them how to ride horses. The children were introduced to a variety of different breeds of horses and could easily differentiate the horses from other farm animals such as cows. However, they could not detect the differences that distinguished different breeds. Over the several months that they were exposed to these different breeds, the children began to recognize the distinctive features which differentiated one breed from another (i.e. Arabians have slender, dished noses, long bodies, and arched tails; whereas Quarter Horses have much shorter, stockier frames as well as heads). The children had learned to abstract out relevant features and relationships between features that constituted differences between breeds through the process, termed by Eleanor Gibson, of perceptual learning (6a).
