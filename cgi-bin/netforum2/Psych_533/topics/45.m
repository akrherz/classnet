5a.  Elaborative Interrogation.   Source: Pressley, Chapter 11.  Explanation:  As a  method used to improve the learning of facts, elaborative interrogation involves asking the student why questions on the material to be learned.  Research has shown that elaborative interrogation is effective and useful for learning information presented in list or expository passage form.  The questioning used in elaborative interrogation is hypothesized to work because it prompts the learner to activate prior knowledge and make links to the new information to be learned.  
<br>
5b.  Advanced Organizers:   Source:  Ausubel in Pressley, Chapter 11.  Explanation:  Advanced organizers are a type of instructional strategy that is used to improve both learning and comprehension.  Instruction using advanced organizers involves providing the student with headings, figures, or an outline prior to the actual material to be learned.  The advanced organizers not only signal important concepts to be learned, but also provide a structure or framework in which the individual can process the information.  Ausubel claimed that advanced organizers help students understand and remember new information, particularly reading passages containing new information.  
<br>
5c.  Multiple Ability Treatment.  Source:  Cohen  & Lotan (1995).  Explanation:  One of the two interventions used by Cohen and Lotan to alter the status processes in heterogeneous classrooms or groups.  Multiple ability treatment starts with a discussion by the teacher about how collective group tasks involve various types of intellectual abilities, that are not possessed by all members in the group.  It is stressed that different members of the group have some ability or competency in the different tasks that make up the collective group task.  
<br>
5d.  Assigning Competence:  Source:  Cohen  & Lotan (1995).  Explanation:  The other intervention used by Cohen and Lotan to equalize status in heterogeneous classrooms and promote the participation and achievement of lower-status students.  Assigning competence involves the teacher providing low status students with genuine and positive evaluations of their work or knowledge.  When the teacher provides the student with positive evaluations of their competencies in front of other students in the classroom or group and points out the relevance of those competencies to the work at hand, other students will also recognize that students ability and competence.  This raises the student's status in comparison to other students, increases his/her evaluations of self and abilities, and leads to an increase in classroom participation.  
<br>
6. Application:  
<br>
	I will be the teacher for a middle school geography classroom that is starting a lesson and group projects on different countries.  Students have been assigned to small groups.  The groups are heterogeneous in nature and were based on the teacher identifying the particular competencies of students and balancing groups based on these competencies.  The final project involves discussing the geography of the country, its history and culture, and its economic resources and exports.  
<br>
	Prior to dividing the students into groups, I would instruct the students on the use of advanced organizers as a strategy.  Students will practice using paragraph and chapter headings, keyword lists, and the graphs and figures in the text to predict what the reading will cover.  Students will also be encouraged to come up with why questions that might guide their reading, processing, and learning of the information (application of elaborative interrogation).  
<br>
	Each group will be provided with a short passage on their country.  As a group, they will have to come up with some questions that they want to answer in their presentation.  Students are encouraged to discuss their individual interests and abilities that they are bringing to the group (application of the multiple ability treatment).  I will facilitate this discussion by pointing out strengths and competencies that each of the members has demonstrated on either classroom lessons and tasks that parallel those needed for the current group project or on current contributions to the project.  Using examples of previous work will help in pointing out and assigning competencies to students who may not feel comfortable participating in the group (i.e. low status students).  By providing the group with evaluative positive feedback on the individual competencies of the group, the members will have greater confidence in their own abilities to contribute to the project and will help the group organize each individual's role on the project, distributing the leadership on the project (application of assigning competencies).  
<br>
	Once the group has determined who is responsible for what and have gathered resources, they will begin to put together the project.  Students will be expected to use advanced organizers provided in the resources they are using to organize the information and help facilitate the learning of the information by other members in their group.  The final presentation will involve a group presentation on the country, including handouts by the group that include key topics and information that the class should learn from the presentation.  The class (audience) will use this handout as an advanced organizers to understanding the material in the presentation.  The handout should also include why questions generated by the group  that will be used for discussion following the presentation.  Students in the audience are also encouraged to jot down questions for discussion during the presentation.  The questions should encourage the deeper processing of information by requiring students to consider prior knowledge gained in previous lessons and presentations in the geography class (application of elaborative interrogation).

5. Concept and Explanation Section
<br>
5a. Acedemic Engagement. Source: This idea was introduced in Chapter 11 of the Pressley text. Explanation: The process of encouraging a student to become "invested in and committed to learning, understanding, and mastering what is presented in school." This involves techniques such as providing authentic tasks, flexibility of pace and methods, and frequent occasions for students to ask questions. Engaged students are concerned with how well they are doing, and care about outcomes in addition to grades. They create new understandings for themselves rather than simply applying rote memorization. 
<p>
5b. Higher and Lower Order Teacher Questioning. Source: This idea was introduced in Chapter 11 of the Pressley text. Explanation: One way that educators can make a difference in a students education is to ask questions that determine the extent to which a concept or topic is understood. This can involve two types of questioning. Higher order questions are ones which require a "manipulation of information and reflection". These types of questions invoke a higher level of thinking and a deeper level of understanding than do lower order questions. Lower order questions only require simple recall of information which has been stored in a student's memory.
<p>
5c. Encourage Student Questions. Source: This idea was introduced in Chapter 11 of the Pressley text. Explanation: Just as it is useful for educators to ask students questions to ensure understanding, it is also important for students to ask questions of the teacher or other peers- especially when they do not understand or need clarification on a concept or topic.
<p>
5d. Mastery Learning. Source: This idea was introduced in Chapter 11 of the Pressley text. Explanation: In this type of learning program, course content is broken down into manageable units. The students learn one unit at a time by studying and taking quizzes on the material presented in that unit. In order to proceed to the next unit, a student must pass the current unit's exam at a high level of mastery, constituted by a score between 80% and 100%.
<p>
6. Applications Section
<br>
While in undergraduate school, I took a couple of what was known at that time as open learning courses. These types of courses were constructed as a type of "work at your own pace" class. The student was required to take quizzes and exams on one unit and then move on to the next if they had achieved a certain score. There was no actual lecture per se. Students could meet with the instructor on an individual basis during scheduled open learning lab hours.
<p>
I believe that this type of arrangement could be very applicable to the concepts I have chosen to highlight from the material presented in Chapter 11 of the Pressley text. If I were an instructor teaching a course in basic Psychology, I could offer the course as an open learning one. The course content would be broken down into units, which a student must master individually before moving onto a later unit. A student would be required to master the material presented in each individual unit and must demonstrate this by passing each quiz and exam with a score of 80% or better (5d).
<p>
On the road to mastering the material in each unit, it would be very advantageous for the student to meet with me during the scheduled open learning lab hours. During this time, I would attept to engage the student (5a) into the class and the material presented in it. This would be much easier to do in an open learning lab setting becuase since I would have the opportunity to meet with each student on an individual basis, I could then tailor the way I presented the material around the student. I would attempt to provide the student with authentic tasks that they found both interesting and challenging, in order for the student to create their own personal understanding, as opposed to rote memorization, of the material.
<p>
At this time, I would ask the student questions to evaluate their mastery of the material. Some of the questions I might pose to the idividual would be lower order ones such as "What discipline is Sigmund Freud associated with?", which would simply involve recalling that particular information which the student had previously memorized from the material presented in that unit. Other questions would be higher order ones such as "Compare and contrast the Psychoanalytic and Gestalt theories of learning." This type of question would require a much higher level of thinking and a much deeper level of understanding than would the lower order question example (5b).
<br>
 
<br>
In addition to posing higher and lower order questions to the student, I would also encourage the student to ask many questions of his or her own (5c). I would want the student to ask clarification questions any time s/he did not come to a level of full personal understanding of any concept or topic. In this way, I would hope to generate not only curiosity on the part of the student, but also provide an open and relaxed environment- one in which the student could feel comfortable and become invested in his or her education.

5a.  Volunteers in the classroom.  Source:  Pressley.  Explanation:  Tutoring of students by volunteers increases the achievements of tutees.  Pressley says “the clear benefits of tutoring provided by volunteers should stimulate additional efforts to increase the use of volunteers in school” (Pressley, p. 261).

5b.  Reciprocal peer tutoring.  Source:  Pressley.  Explanation:  Students in a class are paired with one another, and are asked to help each other prepare for exams.  For example:  Before each exam, each student comes up with a short series of multiple-choice questions on the material, administers the questions to his/her partner, and explains the answer for each question that is answered incorrectly.  The process of generating the questions, taking the practice exam and explaining the content reinforces and deepens the learning, making this an effective approach.

5c.  Encouraging student questions.  Source:  Pressley.  Explanation:  When teachers encourage student questions, it can help students understand new material.  When teachers create an atmosphere that is comfortable for students to ask questions, they send a message to the class that asking questions is not a sign of low ability, but rather something a smart person does when he/she is in need of help.

5d.  Objectives as a directed learning device.  Source:  lecture.  Explanation:  Objectives help direct students’ attention to relevant information, when used under the appropriate circumstances (the learning of facts or simple concepts and principles) 


	I am teaching an introductory college-level journalistic writing course.  The course is structured with two exams to test factual information, and a series of journalistic writing assignments throughout the semester.  The course syllabus will include a series of objectives tied to each unit to help direct the students’ attention to the important information.  The content of the exams will closely follow the objectives.  
	To help the students prepare for the exams, they will be placed in a reciprocal peer tutoring situation.  The will be asked to write a brief exam, administer it to their partner, and discuss the answers to the questions before they take the exam I will administer.
	Student questions will be strongly encouraged -- for two reasons:  First, because it can help students understand the material, and second (and perhaps more importantly) because as budding journalists, asking questions is a very important part of their job.  I will provide frequent opportunities for students to ask questions by occasionally leaving gaps in the information I present to them and providing positive feedback to students who ask clarifying questions.  (Of course if no one asks the needed question to fill in the gap I will model the questioning process myself, and provide the needed information).
	I will also utilize the concepts of volunteers in the classroom by inviting local journalists from a variety of backgrounds to visit the classroom.  As we discuss magazine writing, for example, we might invite a writer from Meredith Corporation in Des Moines (the publisher of Better Homes and Gardens) to talk to the students about magazine writing and careers in magazine writing.  The volunteer would be invited back for the next class period to work with the students as they write their magazine stories, offering suggestions and ideas for improvement.

a. Amount of schooling influences academic competence (IQ).  [Ceci, 1991 in Pressley, p 254]  Newman (in Pressley) claims that the effect of schools are the ones that permit and foster a high degree of pupil engagement in learning.
Pupil engagement in learning:  Engaged students  are invested and committed to learning, understanding  and mastering what is presented in schools.  They concentrate on their work, are enthusiastic about work and are deeply interested in academic content.

Good schools lead students to acquire about academic issues, require integration of knowledge  and produce outcomes that carries a deeper meaning than the grade it results.
It presents the students with tasks they own, it involves them in decision-making about the curriculum and its assessments.

Engagement or Engaging Environments encourage risk-taking, respects students dignity and project a message that the student is important.  They should also be fun.

b. Teacher Questioning of Students about Academic Content. [Pressley, p259]
Questions a student experiences in school DO make a difference in learning.  Higher order questioning requiring manipulation of information and reflection and lower order questioning requiring simple recall of information  must be differentiated to understand and appreciate the effects of questioning on student learning.  Higher order questioning are important in high ability classes and lower order questioning may increase the likelihood that weaker classes will at least learn the facts.  Higher order questioning stimulates students to go beyond the facts, think through things and relate the new information to prior knowledge. 

c. Encouraging students Questions [Pressley, p260]:
Makes students understand that asking questions when uncertain is what smart people do when they are in need of assistance.  Teaching children how to ask questions about the content helps them to process it (courage 1989).

d. Teacher Expectancies [Pressley, p260]:
-Rosenthal and Jacobson found that teachers expectancies  of student achievement was a powerful determinant of actual achievement.  Pressley concludes it has only a small effect on student achievement.  Brody and Goode believe that differential treatments affects students perceptions of themselves and their own abilities.  

volunteers in the classrooms can strengthen school community relationships and increases achievement of tutees. 

6. First and second graders are in reading groups grouped according to reading levels.  Each student n the group is videotaped reading a book chosen by the teacher, but based on the skills from the reading assessments done previously by the teacher.  After this is completed, the child and the parent view the tapes at home together, discusses it and writes about what they likes and disliked about the reading materials and what they would like to do to improve the child's reading.  They are introduced to the fiction and non-fiction concepts and have been working on making predictions.  After some of the readings they make response booklets for these books.  In the response booklets they write and draw responses to the books they've been reading using prompts given by the teacher.

a. This lesson presents students with the task  they own.  It is seen as authentic to the students because it allows the student to assess their own reading abilities and skills.  Their responses to the material allows them to critique and contribute to the curriculum.  They decide what books they like and dislike.  Students may read better if they like the material, and thus obtain a higher achievement level. also if they feel they have some control over the learning process, they may enjoy learning more. 

b. The response booklets allows students to invent their own work and possibly contribute to the literary environment, therefore, they will be more engaged in the reading / language arts process.  Their contributions will enable students to internalize their importance in the learning process and possible raise achievement levels.

c. Children are questioned before and after stories on whether or not they are fiction or non-fiction after learning and understanding the difference between the two.  The students can explain  why it is fiction or non-fiction with the prompts  of higher level questioning because they must reflect on the content of the stories to know. This will help in assessing the levels of comprehension.  Lower level questions could be used to determine whether the students understood the basic facts in the story.  (great for non-fiction books).
