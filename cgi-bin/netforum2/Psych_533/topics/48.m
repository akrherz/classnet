5a.  Phonemic Awareness.  Source:  Pressley, Chap 14.  Explanation:  Phonemic awareness is a critical competency in the development of reading in children and the best predictor of success in early reading.  Phonemic awareness focuses on the idea that words are composed of different sounds (phonemes) and that phonemes are combined to say words.  In essence, phonemic awareness instruction focuses on letter-sound relationships.  Children who lack or have poor phonemic awareness skills often have difficulties with spelling and reading.  Teaching of letters and sounds by parents in the early years of child development (prior to school) is correlated with better phonemic awareness skills in preschool and kindergarten children.
<p>
<br>
5b.  Reading by Analogy.  Source: Goswami & Bryant (1992) in Pressley Chap. 14.  Explanation:  Reading by analogy represents one of the many strategies taught in reading instruction.  The basic idea is that words that sound the same often resemble each other in the spelling patterns.  For example, Cat and Bat  sound similar and they are made up of the same sequence of letters. (i.e. the -at ending).  Goswami and Bryant (1992) argue that reading by analogy is not just an advanced reading strategy, but it can also be an available and effective strategy for beginning readers, particularly when instruction focuses on word endings.  Beginning readers may use rhyming words to figure out new words.
<p>
<br>
5c.  Semantic Context Clues.  Source:  Pressley, Chap. 14.  Explanation:  A popular hypothesis in the reading literature, semantic context clues refers to the idea that words read within context offer cues to the meaning of words, which facilitates decoding.  The use of semantic context clues represents an attempt to compensate for poor decoding skills in reading.
<p>
<br>
5d.  Dual Route Theory.  Source:  Ehri (1992) in Pressley, Chap 14.  Explanation:  A popular theory of flexibility in decoding, the dual route theory postulates that knowledge of some words is based on their visual representation rather than a derivation of the words pronunciation when the word is not visually familiar and the subsequent matching of the pronunciation to an item in the mental lexicon.  To routes or processes are involved in the decoding or reading of text.  The visual route (i.e. sight word and orthographic reading) involves faster and more direct processing of the word, while the phonological decoding processes (i.e. alphabetic reading or phonics rule application) is slower and less direct.  
<p>
<br>
5e.  Transactional Strategies Instruction.  Source:  Pressley, Chap. 14 and Brown, Pressley, Van Meter, a& Schuder (1996).  Explanation:  An effective method of reading instruction, transactional strategies instruction is characterized by: (1) the encouragement of readers to construct meaning from the use of strategies that enable the linking of the text content to the readers' prior knowledge, (2) strategy instruction occurs in reading groups and involves group members using strategies to construct meaning together, and (3) teacher and group interactions cannot be anticipated.  Transactional strategies instruction emphasizes that interpretations of the text and what occurs within the reading group are codetermined by teacher-student-text interactions.  
<p>
<br>
6.  Application:
<p>
       I am assisting and observing a teacher in a special class for students with profound reading difficulties at a middle school.  The middle school consists of grades five through eight.  The special class is made up of four students in the fifth grade who have been identified as having reading problems and who require extra instruction in reading to supplement their fifth grade Language Arts class.  Traditionally, fifth graders do not get additional instruction in reading at the middle school.
	
<p>
     The orientation of instruction in the class follows the dual route theory, in that students are instructed in both phonological-based strategies and visual reading strategies.  A major emphasis is placed on recognition of word patterns and letter-sound correspondence.  The primary goal is to increase the students reading strategy use and general reading ability/competency.  Because reading fluency is one of the best predictors of literacy, instruction and progress monitoring focuses on fluency versus comprehension.  Comprehension skills and strategies are incorporate into the instruction, but are not the focus.  Instructional units focus on particular word-sound families.  
	
<p>
     At the beginning of each class, students receive direct instruction in particular sound-letter patterns in words.  Reading by analogy is incorporated into this part of the lesson.  Students learn words that share the same pattern of letters and sound.  When they have mastered a particular sound-letter pattern, variations on the sound-letter patterns are added.  For example,  instruction on the "-ee" words may be followed by words that sound the same, but use "-ea" or alternative patterns.  Students are quizzed orally on the spelling of words.  This involves attention to phonological awareness.  The teacher will say the word in full and then proceed to break the word into its corresponding sounds.  If students have difficulty with a word, they are prompted with the phoneme.  In addition to workbooks that focus on sound-letter correspondence and letter patterns in words, the students play a card game that involves phonemic awareness and letter patterns.  During the game students must read a word and look for other words in the "bone pile" or the other players' hands that follows the same phonemic rule.  Before they can pick up cards, they must explain their reason and say the words using both sound segmentation ("b-oa-t") and sound blending ("boat").  
	
<p>
<br>
    A portion of the class period is also spent reading as a group from.  Students take turns reading pages from their books.  Transactional strategies instruction is used in this activity.  The teacher will generate questions that involve having the students predict what will happen next and summarize what has happened.  This offers a chance to check the students reading comprehension.  When students experience difficulties decoding words, the teacher encourages the child by providing clues about the sounds in the word or pointing out familiar letter-patterns.  The teacher also prompts the student to use clues from the text to decode the word (Semantic Context Cues).  Once a week, the students are assigned a particular section of the text to practice on their own so that they can read it in front of the class.  Students are encouraged to use the strategies instructed in class and discuss any difficulties they may have with their teacher, parents, or fellow students.  Weekly practiced readings provide the teacher with an opportunity to monitor reading fluency and analyze common reading errors.

5a. Phonemic Awareness. Source: Chapter 14 of the Pressley text. Explanation: The awareness that words are composed of separate sounds, or phonemes, and that these are combined to form pronouncable words. It is phonemic awareness which is one of the best predictors of early reading sucess. If a child demonstrates low phonemic awareness by age 4-6, reading difficulties can be predicted. On the other hand, good readers demonstrate high levels of phonemic awareness.
<p>
5b. Lographic (Visual Cue) Reading. Source: Chapter 14 of the Pressley text. Explanation: This type of reading involves using visual information (or cues) associated with a word as opposed to simply utilizing "letter-sound correspondences". For example, a child may be able to read the word "STOP" when it is on a red hexagon, yet may not be able to read the same word when it is out of this type of context.
<p>
5c. Alphabetic Reading. Source: Chapter 14 of the Pressley text. Explanation: This type of reading involves the traditional "sounding out of words using letter sound relations". This process begins even before children know all of the letter sound correspondencies. In order to do this type of reading, the child must have attained a certain level of the previously explained concept of phonetic awareness, because "knowing about letters, their names, and sounds may not be suficient if the student does not possess phonetic awareness".
<p>
5d. Orthographic Reading. Source: Chapter 14 of the Pressley text. Explanation: This type of reading is utilized when the reader begins to perceive meaningful letter strings as wholes. For example, the reader perceives prefixes and suffixes as functional units as opposed to individual letters or sounds. This occurs only after the child has gained experience with alphabetic reading and has come to automatize certain letter combinations as meaningful wholes.
<p>
<br>
6. If I were teaching reading to first grade children, I would first test their level of awareness that words are composed of separate sounds (phonetic awareness). For children achieving scores that indicated a low level of phonemic awareness, I would provide additional instruction involving how to categorize words based on their sounds, how to identify common sounds, and how to identify non-similar sounds in games such as "odd one out".
<p>
After this initial test, and additional instuction for those students who needed it, I would begin my course on reading by teaching the children to recognize words by providing appopriate visual information (cues) associated with them (lographic reading). For example, I may make flashcards on which the word I am teaching the children to recognize is accompanied by a visual representation, or picture, of the word. The word dog would be accompanied by a picture of a dog and the word banana would be accompanied by a picture of a banana. In this way, the children would begin to recognize words by associating them with their visual representations.
<p>
<br>
After the children have reached a certain level of mastery of lographic reading, I would then lead them through the process of reading word by sounding them out (alphabetic reading) by using their letter sound relations. I would begin with simple and phonetically correct words such as cat, car, etc. Once they have mastered the sounding out of simple words, I would then lead them through the same task with words a bit more difficult, such as letter, color, etc.
<p>
 
Once the children can sound out words utilizing the alphabetic reading process, I would move on to teaching the child to peceive meaningful letter strings as wholes (orthographic reading). This would invlolve helping the child to recognize that certain letter combinations, which by this time the child has automatized, carry certain meanings. For example, the child would be taught to recognize that the suffix -ing, ed, and s carry standard units of meaning in every word in which they are present.

5a.  Emergent Literacy.  Source:  Pressley.  Explanation:  A lot of literacy development occurs during the preschool years, which is a period of emergent literacy.  It can be seen in the reading and writing behaviors during the preschool years, and eventually develops into conventional literacy.  Good emergent literacy environments typically include rich interpersonal experiences with parents and siblings, plenty of literacy materials, and a high regard by parents for literacy and its development in children.


5b.  Storybook Interactions.  Source:  Pressley.  Explanation:  Storybook interactions are rich discussions and animated conversations between the reader and the child.  The adult and child discuss the meaning of the text, there is modeling of dialogue by adults, and positive reinforcement for the child who tries to get meaning from the pictures and the print.  Both the child and the adult relate what is happening in the text to their lives and the world around them.


5c.  Phonemic Awareness.  Source:  Pressley.  Explanation:  Phonemic awareness is awareness that words are made up of separable sounds (phonemes), and those sounds are combined to say words.  Children who lack phonemic awareness have trouble learning to spell and learning to understand letter-sound relationships.  Poor readers of all ages are typically less phonemically aware than similar-aged good readers.


5d.  Logographic Reading.  Source:  Pressley.  Explanation:  Logographic reading is sometimes referred to as visual cue reading.  It involves using only certain visual characteristics of a word to decode it, rather than relying on letter-sound correspondences.  Children who rely on logographic reading form an association between the visual cue and the word.


6.  My most important teaching opportunity is helping my 18-month-old toddler get a good start on learning.  We’ve been reading to Connor since before he was born.  We read at least one book before he leaves for daycare in the morning, and he usually demands at least three books at night before he’ll go to sleep.  By making books constantly available to him, taking the time to read to him daily, and letting him see that books are also important to his parents, we have created a positive environment for emergent literacy.  (He has enjoyed Pressley’s book, although he has been compelled to add his own drawings due to the lack of pictures).  Connor’s language skills are just beginning to show, so our discussions about the books we read together are very limited so far.  Despite his language limitations he is able to understand considerably more than he is able to verbalize, so our book reading sessions deviate considerably from the text.  I talk about the pictures, relate pictures in the text to real-world objects, such as our cat, various toys, and other items around the house.  As he matures, I intend to utilize storybook interactions with him, using scaffolding techniques to help him get meaning from the pictures and the print.  We’ll also work on phonemic awareness, beginning with letter recognition in books and the real world.

Good readers are active readers who use diverse strategies for monitoring their understanding.

Emergent literacy [Clay 1966] in Pressley:  Literacy development occurs  at the preschool level.  Literacy begins  in infancy and develps anywhere a child is (home, school, etc.).  Children are actuve ub tgeur kuteract development.   

[Pressley, p ]Supportive emergent literary environments consist of rich interpersonal experiences with family members, environments filled with reading material and a child whose parents has a high regard for literacy.  

Storybook Reading provides rich discussions and animated conversations between the reader and the child.  Together they work out the meaning of the text with fun.  Questions takes place by both participants.  Both relate what is happening in the text to their lives.  The quality of storybook reading affected longterm literacy development.  The more parents interact verbally with their children, the more verbally competent the children are.  

Reading During Elementary Years [Pressley, p 354]:

a.  Decoding  Instructions benefit most children.   Phenomic awareness [p 355] (words composed ofseparate sounds and phonemes are combined to say words.  Children who fail to learn to read this after the first few years of school lack this awareness.  Formal instruction in reading is essential for phonemic awareness to develop.

b. Logographic, Selective Association or Visual Cue Reading [Gough,1992] in Pressley, p357:  Involves using only salient visual characteristics of a word rather than relying on letter-sound and correspondence.  Children associate the visual cue and the word.  [eg.  the words are accompanied by a graphic symbol :  the graphic symbol- golden arches- are always associated with McDonalds.]

c. Alphabet Reading -Pressley, pg. 357: This concept emphasizes sounding out words using letter sound relations:  Children operate based on this concept long before they know all the letter-sound correspondences.  Children use this concept in invented spelling.  This also helps them in reading using what [Ehri 1991] refers to as phonetic cue reading.  

d. The Cipher [Gough,1992] in Pressley is a code mapping sound of a language onto its alphabet.  Acquiring the cipher and using it increases speed and accuracy in reading of unfamiliar words.  Specific rules must be learned when learning cipher.  


e. Orthographic Reading-  Pressley, p 357, occurs only after a child has experience with alphabet reading.  Meaningful letters together has meaning e.g. "ing"  "able", prefixes and suffixes.  Good advantages of reading words  by sight an orthographic chunks are processed as wholes.

Automaticity theory [Samuel, Schermer and Reinking, 1992] in Pressley p359,   involves 2 task:  decoding and comprehending.  They require little effort and attention.  

Reading by Analogy (Pressley, p359)  words that sound the same often have the same spelling patterns.  It strengthens associations.

To assure  a reading environment that meets the requirement for emergent literacy, children should be read to from birth.  Family members should read to children daily and let children see them read as well.  

Example:
Each child is given a book with 6 pages.  The last page includes a string of 3 letters like "ake".  The students are to add 5 pages on top using one letter that can be added to the string to make a word.  This booklet should be taken home and read to parents. By adding letters like c, r, t, m  and f, the children will create words and practice Reading by Analogies.  They will recognize the spelling patterns.  Each time the  string is encountered and pronounced, it will strengthen the association with the sound.
	They must then draw pictures of the words so that as they practice these words they see them.  As this relates to automaticity  theory, they decode the words and the picture allows them to comprehend the meaning of the word.  The picture also can represent selective association.  If the teacher provides  the drawing for each word, (s)he can give some clue in the graphic that the child could remember (e.g.. if the string  is "ell" and b, d, f, s, and h are the letters given on the other pages, the "ll" could be drawn as hockey sticks.  Phonetic cue reading suggests that the hockey sticks are parts of the information children will use to connect the word in their memory.
