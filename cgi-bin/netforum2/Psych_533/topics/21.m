5. a.Behavior modification: 
Source- Pressley. Behavior modification is an intervention strategy that is  based on the idea that one should reinforce behaviors that are desirable.  For instance, in the classroom, desirable behaviors might include having students raise their hands before speaking, being polite to others, etc.  A teacher practicing behavior modification would encourage/reinforce these behaviors by using positive or negative enforcers.  As such behaviors are reinforced, children are more likely to continue them. 


B.  Positive and  negative reinforcers:
Source-Pressley.  Positive and negative reinforcers are used in behavior modification to reinforce desirable behaviors.  Positive reinforcers provide the person acting out the behavior with seem they deem as important or desirable.  For instance, a positive reinforcer for completing a given number of assignments on time for someone who loves to read would be to allot them a set amount of free reading time.

Negative reinforcers are not means for punishment.  In fact, they take away negative stimuli.  For example, removing spinach from someone1s plate that hates the smell of it could be considered a negative reinforcer.

Both positive and negative reinforcers increase desirable behaviors if used correctly.


C. Expectancy related to punishment and reward:
Source: Pressley.  This concept can be summarized by this statement. 3The probability of performing behavior X is a function of the expectancy of reward or punishment for X and the value of the reward or punishment.2  This implies that a person is more likely to behave in a given way due to the way that this behavior is rewarded or punished.  If the behavior is highly rewarded the behavior is more likely to be acted out.  If a behavior is known to have serious negative consequences, people are not apt to perform them.  In other words, behavior is somewhat controlled by what we perceive as the consequences for such behaviors whether they be good or bad.

D. Observational/social learning theory:
Source: Pressley. Observational learning theory is centered around the notion that we learn things by observing others.  This has evolved into social learning theory because it has been found that many of our social behaviors are learned through observation.  Social learning theory also identifies with other theories of learning including analysis of behavior.

E.  Retentional processes:
Source: Pressley.  Retentional processes are those that help us remember things that will affect what we do in the future.  These might include, but are not limited to, encoding strategies involving imagery and verbalization, and rehearsal processes.  Basically, retentional processes are anything we do that helps us retain information for future use.  For instance, while trying to remember items on our grocery list, we might try a rehearsal technique. 

6. A.  It is the first day of school and I have gone over my expectations for the year.  One of these expectations is that when I give an assignment, everyone should do their best, work quietly and try to get the task completed on time.  It is now 1:25pm  and time for math.  I give the students an assignment, but notice that I have made it kind of lengthy and redundant and that this is frustrating for many of my students.  As I walk around the room, I can also see that all my expectations dealing with work habits are being met.  I make this known to them and tell them that because they are doing such a good job, I will shorten the assignment because I realize that I made a mistake by making it too long.  (Behavior modification)


B.  John and Susie, two of my students are having difficulty turning their homework in on time.  When talking to them, I find that John loves stickers and Susie absolutely hates it when I make her line leader.  Together we make a contract stating that John will get two stickers (positive reinforcer)for every homework assignment that he turns in on time.  If Susie turns her homework in on time, I will not appoint her as line leader (negative reinforcer).

C. Fighting is by no means tolerated in my classroom.  I make it a point to tell students up-front that anyone who gets in a fight in my classroom will automatically be sent to the principal1s office.  It just so happens that Mr. Smith, the principal, is feared by all.  Now that they know this, students are less likely to get in a fight because they do not like the consequences.  (Expectancy for punishment)

D. My students are completing an art activity that requires them to mix paint.  So that they will do this in an efficient manner, I first model the desired procedure.  Then students know what is expected of them. (Observational learning)

E. My students are responsible for learning a poem to recite in an assembly.  I try to assist them by offering them some rehearsal tips.  I tell them to start by learning the first line and then once this is done, keep adding lines until they know the whole poem.  This is s better technique that trying to learn the whole poem at once. (Retentional processes)
