1) Prepare your assignment or critique in your favorite word processor.  If it is Microsoft word, word perfect, or Microsoft works, you can save it as a regular document file.  This will probably work for Claris works also.  To be sure, save it as a text or ascii file.  Save it on a floppy disk.
 
2) Assuming you don’t have the WWW at home, bring the floppy disk to a computer lab on campus. (If you have the WEB at home, select and mark the text you want to post in your word processer.  Switch to Netscape or your favorite brower, then follow Netscape directions below.)  If the lab is a Windows based lab, you will need a disk formatted for the PC or Microsoft DOS system.  If it is a Mac lab, the Mac’s can probably read either type of disk.
(W205 Lago is a Windows based lab.  The CTLT has both Mac and PC(Windows) labs (e.g. E061 Lago).  These are the closest labs to the classroom.)  A list of computer labs on campus
 
3) Put the disk with the file in the floppy drive of the computer.
 
4) Open up Microsoft Word.
 
5) Open the file on your floppy that you want.  Word may need to convert the file.  It should do this automatically.  If it can’t convert your file, you will have to save your files as text or ascii files.)
 
6) Select and copy the text (Mac:  openApple-A, openApple-C, Windows: ctrl-A, ctrl-C).
