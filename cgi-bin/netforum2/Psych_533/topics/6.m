5a. Direct explanation. Source: Pressley. Explanation: Instruction that provides “explicit information about academic processes or concepts.” This often involves modeling by the teacher, an emphasis on strategizing which is encouraged in the student, recognition that this will involve some struggling, a good deal of reexplaining, helping the student adapt his/her thinking to the modeled task and support for student reflection over what was taught.
<p>
5b. Discovery teaching and Guided Discovery. Source: Pressley. Explanation: Instruction that is non-directive. The objective is to establish a rich environment within which the student works on a task. The teacher’s role, is generally limited to setting up the environment and responding to the students’ questions. Guided discovery does involve some leadership by the teacher, usually through the posing of questions as the students progress.
<p>
5c. Scaffolding. Source: Pressley. Explanation: Instruction that takes the form of presenting just enough material or modeling so the student can grasp it and move on. The teacher carefully monitors the student progress and guides only when necessary. The idea is to support the growing inner processes by external modeling and explanation until the student has fully internalized the process desired.
<p>
5d. Modeling and Observational Learning. Source: Pressley. Explanation: Learning achieved by watching a master in action. it has to go hand-in-hand with imitation, though not necessarily pure mimicry, as the student will internalize and interpret the model’s actions in his/her own way.
<p>
5e. Educational Technology. Source: Pressley. Explanation: Tools that assist students in the learning process, generally through promoting one of the other methods described above. Usually, this refers to electronic technology, but should more aptly be applied to any tool that facilitates student learning.

6a. I am teaching students the way computers process information and how it compares with the way humans think. One activity is learning how a Turing machine works. Since none of the students have any knowledge of the a Turing machine I begin with a direct explanation of the history and purpose of Turing’s work. I then move into the central part of the lesson by showing the following simple Turing machine:
<p>
s00NRs0		s10NLs2		s20xxx
<br>
		s01NRs1		s11NRs1		s21Cstop
<p>
After a direct explanation of the symbols involved, I model the process of working through the machine using the string 0000110000. I will do this at least a couple of times, often retracing my steps, perhaps with a different string, letting the students learn by observing my modeling until the students are confident they understand what I have done. 
<p>
I will then give them at least a couple more machines and strings to work with on their own, while I work with them individually when necessary, reexplaining and remodeling procedures just enough to get them over hurdles. This scaffolding approach continues with the aid of students who have achieved a higher level of internalization helping those who are struggling until all students have succeeded in working through the machines. I then assign one more machine to take home along with a number of questions designed to help the students reflect on the mechanical processes they just learned.
<p>
6b. Another activity that helps students understand the binary nature of computing is a sorting board. This board has eight pockets on it. In each pocket is a card with a number between 1 and 100. I hand out four of these boards at the beginning of class and ask students to work together in groups. I ask the groups to sort the cards from smallest to largest using the following rules:
<p>
a. Only two cards can be examined at a time.
<br>
b. You may trade positions of the two cards showing.
<br>
c. You may not base the choice of which card to look at next by remembering the value of a card that is not showing.
<p>
I now turn the students loose to work out their own sorting routines. My job at this point becomes solely one of clarifying the rules and preventing any “cheating” on the part of the groups, whether inadvertent or intentional. Once all of the groups discover a method of sorting the numbers I ask them to explain it to the rest of the class. Once they have succeeded at this I ask them to “formalize it”: write down the rules that make their method work (including a mechanism for stopping the routine - the most difficult step). This discovery approach, sometimes aided by leading questions if a group is struggling, usually results in two or three of the simplest sorting routines being discovered by the students themselves. 
<p>
It should be added that the pocketed boards provide just the kind of transparent technology needed to allow students to see through the tool into the cognitive process involved in the exercise. The use of this kind of technology helps students understand the hidden processes deep within the “black box” of the computer.
<p>
Again, once the activity is finished I provide time for reflection and discussion on the kind of thinking that this kind of task required, why this is the way a computer must sort, and how it compares with what the students see themselves doing when they sort.
