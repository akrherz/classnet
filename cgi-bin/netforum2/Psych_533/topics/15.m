Explanation: People who have much domain-specific knowledge are better able to perform tasks within the domain, including learning tasks, than are novices within the domain. "Knowledge within the domain is a more important determinant of performance on many tasks than general intellect."<br> 5b.  Expert thinking. Source: The idea that experts think differently from non-experts was presented in Pressley and lecture. Explanation: Experience and education (are they different?) build schemata that give experts the ability to make associations and concentrate on significant, rather than peripheral, features. <br>5c.  Wrong knowledge impedes learning. Source: This idea was presented in Pressley. Explanation: While correct domain-specific knowledge assists in making new associations, incorrect "knowledge" makes it difficult to build schemata when new information that doesn't match is presented. <br>5d.  Experts become experts over a long period of learning. Source: This idea was presented in Pressley. Explanation: Top-notch experts in many fields typically took 10 to 20 years to become experts, and are rarely identified as "prodigies." <br>5e.  Knowledge mediation can replace strategies. Source: This idea was presented in Pressley. Explanation: As strategies are employed on specific problems, repeated answers become learned, so the learned response can be immediately retrieved, bypassing the process of employing a strategy. <br>6. I am teaching an adult proper right arm and hand position when playing the piano accordion. The student already knows how to play piano. He has learned that a curved finger position is desirable, and assumes an appropriate curved finger position. However, he has also learned that "arms hang down at the sides" when playing, and so keeps his right elbow close to his body, thereby forcing an undesirably sharp bend in the wrist. (Other reasons may exist for the elbow-in position, including nervousness and self-consciousness; both of these causes can be alleviated through my own example and welcome as I carry out the following instruction.) I instruct the student that a better position is to have the elbow raised and away from the body, which allows a straighter line from elbow through wrist to hand. To demonstrate the utility of the position, I have the student hold his arm out in front of him, palm down, and then bend his wrist. I point out that as the wrist bends, relaxed fingers straighten; as the wrist straightens, relaxed fingers naturally assume the desired curved position. As he repeats the process, I direct his attention to the increased effort and tension required to move the fingers when the wrist is bent. As lessons continue, I keep observing hand position, periodically reminding him of the proper position if he starts to slip.
