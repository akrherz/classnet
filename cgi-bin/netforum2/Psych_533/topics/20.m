1. Intermittent Reinforcement.
Source: This idea was presented in Ch. 7, Pressely's Book.
Explanation: When responses are reinforced at interval rather than every time response occurs, the response will arise continuously with less chance to extinction. There are two ways in intermittent reinforcement-Ratio reinforcement schedule and Interval reinforcement schedule. The first is to reinforce response occurring every given numbered times, e.g., every 5 times. And the last one is to reinforce response at particular time intervals.

2.   Positive Reinforcers and Negative Reinforcers.
Source: This idea was presented in Ch. 7, Pressely's Book.
Explanation: Both positive and negative reinforcers make more chances to occur reinforced response in the future. Positive reinforcers do so by giving learners positive stimulus such as teacher praise, a gift, or stickers after the response. Otherwise, negative reinforcers do so by eliminating some negative stimulus like uncomfortable environment right after the response.

3. Behavior Modification.
Source: This idea was presented in Ch. 7, Pressely's Book.
Explanation: This idea is that students' behavior can be shaped in desirable ways by presenting either reinforcers or punishments. For example, showing a teacher's positive attention to a good behavior of a student promotes the probability for the student to do the same good behavior later. On the contrary, when a student interferes with classroom management by speaking loudly during lecture, To have her/him be isolated from peers for a while can be a way to reduce a chance for the behavior to occur in the future.

4. Observational Learning of Linguistic Competencies.
Source: This idea was presented in Ch. 7, Pressely's Book.
Explanation: Language learners can develop their language competencies through social learning mechanism. This infers that through social exposures, children see how other people use language at different level and in different ways. By modeling and imitation of what they see how people use language, children can acquire language abilities. Also, positively reinforcing the use of language facilitates children's self-efficacy in language use.

Description of Idea Application to My Teaching
<p>
I am teaching speech classes where international students at ISU learn how to present their ideas effectively and efficiently in English (It is not their mother language.). First, I prepare a field trip to a Sun Room at Memorial Union in which an eminent speaker gives a speech about 'Diversity on Campus' to public. Before class, students are asked to participate in the field trip. In this case, the eminent speaker will be a social model who performs a good behavior-a good speech to be learned by students. I will ask students to observe thoroughly what and how the speaker does for a good speech. And then, in class, students will have a chance to discuss the factors good speech should have, which they observed in the field trip. After the class, I will assign students to prepare one short speech for the next class. This hands-on speech practice will be an opportunity for students to reproduce a good behavior, a good speech themselves. By presenting a good model of expressing thoughts to learners, students are given a chance of observational learning of speech. (Application of No. 4 idea: Observational Learning of Linguistic Competencies)

In order to induce a good speech behavior, I will use a positive reinforcer-peer and teacher praise. As I mentioned before, students will be supposed to present a short speech in the next class. While one student are giving a speech, the others are asked to write one good thing done by the speaker. In short, right after each student gives a short speech to class, s/he will receive 'You did great job on…' notes written by classmates and me. The peer's and my praise written on the notes may reinforce the student's speech behavior that is valued as good. (Application of No. 2 idea: Positive Reinforcers) 
	
<p>
Sometimes, among the students, there might be someone who can't concentrate on the others' speech. They ignore the speaker, make a noise, or talk with peer next to them. For them, behavior modification is needed. At the end of the speech class, I will pass around one yellow sheet called 'Yellow Card'. I will ask students to write a name of a student who they think is the most disengaged person during the class. And I will tell them in advance if some names are found on the sheet, the people will lose some points in their final grade for the course. (Application of No. 3 idea: Behavior Modification)
<p>
During the semester, I should have student think the class interesting and useful so that they can be engaged in the class. To reinforce their interest of speech class, once a month, I will videotape their speech practice with a camcorder and then play the tape during the next class. I think seeing the videotape that shows how they performed their own speech is a good reinforcement which enables them think about how they can make a better speech. (Application of No.1 idea: Intermittent Reinforcement)
