===message:5 A)  Students using technology in solving mathematic problems - (Pressley)  In this chapter, Pressley presents the position that technologies such as calculators can be used to perform the mundane and rote procedures, freeing the student to concentrate and learn the overall concepts and more complex procedures.

5 B)  Concentrating mathematics learning on events and relationships - (Pressley)  Teaching mathematics within a real world context or event and dwelling on the relationships between the processes and their purposes will aid students in mathematical learning.

5 C)  Use of many examples - (Pressley)  NCTM pedagogical perspectives, as well as other studies later in the chapter show the need to use multiple examples to illustrate the concepts and procedures being studied.

5 D)  Cooperative learning - (Pressley)  Students working together to solve problems will help them value the process, as well as the answer in mathematical problems.  It promotes metacognition as they justify their ideas to each other.

Application:  Using teacher produced spreadsheets, the students will manipulate data within the spreadsheet to solve a problem.  Students will work in small groups of 3 to make mathematical decisions in a real life situation.  

Situation one:  You are a member of the ecology club. The club has decided to sell T-shirts to raise money.  The cost of the shirts for the club is $10 each.  The club has a goal of making $700.00.  They will incur other costs from advertising, 3rewards2 for top sellers, and other operating costs outlined below in the spreadsheet.  Change the data in order to decide what the cost of the T-shirts should be for customers, budgets for various expenses, and the number of T-shirts that will have to be sold in order to reach the goals.  Justify your decisions and present your ideas as a group.

Situation two:  Your class has decided to produce a school newspaper.  Below are a list of expense categories and possible avenues of revenue.  Work in small groups to decide on a budget for expenses and goals for sales and advertising revenues.  Keep a log of issues that you discuss as you make your decisions, and justify your decisions.  Example:  We thought that it would be realistic to sell ____ copies a week at  ____ each since there are 388 students in the school and about 30 staff and people can afford _____ each week.

===message:5.	Important Ideas
<p>
<br>
a.	General Problem Solving Strategies.  Source:  Pressley (adapted from Polya, 1957).  Explanation:  This idea suggests that there are traits that all problems have in common.  Each of these traits or features can be addressed by steps in Polya’s general problem-solving strategies (i.e., Understand the problem, Devise a plan, Carry out the plan, Look back)  This leads to four somewhat lesser problems that one hopes can be solved individually to lead to the larger solution.  (Most people have trouble with the first two rules)
<p>
<br>

b.	Promoting Understanding.  Source:  Pressley and Cobb.  Explanation:  This idea emphasizes the importance of students understanding mathematical concepts.  It demands that students’ ideas and prior knowledge about mathematics be taken into account when attempting to introduce such concepts as place value.  According to Cobb et al, this understanding will not take place in an educational situation where the teacher does not pursue student explanations, and where a student does not demand a justification that they are capable of understanding.
<p>
<br>
c.	Natural Mathematical Understandings.  Source:  Pressley.  This is closely related to the idea of promoting understanding.  It is a powerful idea because investigations into children’s understanding have demonstrated that they are far more mathematically sophisticated than was previously believed.  If the way children do mathematics is not taken into account, confusion and ineffectiveness ensues.  The term natural mathematical understanding refers to the way in which children do mathematics prior to and sometimes in spite of instruction (e.g., counting on fingers).  Word problems that we might hope reduce abstraction and make problems more concrete can, at certain levels of development (related to decoding of a different symbol set), actually serve to confuse the student as they attempt on their own to identify the elements of a problem.
<p>
<br>
d.	Cooperative Learning.  Source:  Pressley and Cobb.  While this was introduced in a general way in Pressley (Chapter 5), in this situation cooperative learning has been introduced to the domain of mathematics.  In this instance cooperative learning is understood to mean the students in groups attempting to explain math to one another under the guidance of the teacher.  While this is effective for the learners attempting to explain (i.e., to explain you first have to know), in practice learners at the receiving end must be able to demand explanations which they understand.  As Cobb described, for cooperative learning to function to everyone’s benefit, it must take into account the difference among individuals and the way they have chosen to a approach a given concept (e.g., the exchange between Anne and Jack).
<p>
<br>
e.	Interactive Technologies.  Source:  Pressley.  This is my own classification of a group of technologies that Pressley describes in his text under learning from examples.  These technologies include but are not limited to computer programs, calculators, and interactive videodiscs.  These technologies are important in that they can support the understanding of concepts by reducing the somewhat distracting process of computation (i.e. reducing the cognitive load).  These differ from other ways of learning by example because of the quality of interactions that they provide.  They are, in a way, enhanced manipulatives.  Using the ideas described above, these technologies offer teachers the opportunity to focus on the concept learning of students.  (That is if a student already knows how to operate these devices.)
<p>
<br>

6.	Applications:
<p>
<br>
a.	In my role as a technology instructor I would, through direct instruction, deliver Polya’s general strategies for problem-solving.  I would ask the class if this was a reasonable approach.  I would then suggest a problem such as, “How should we learn to use computers for our work?”  As each suggestion is made, as a class we would talk about whether that suggestion met with Polya’s suggested strategy.
<p>
<br>
b.	To promote understanding each student suggesting a plan or strategy would be asked to explain why they thought it might be useful.  Everyone would be asked to suggest something somewhere along the path of Polya’s four rules.  These suggestions and justifications would be entered into a concept mapping computer program such as “Inspiration,” or a drawing program capable of handling text.  The suggestions would be input using a graphics tablet or whiteboard technology (via the internet).  
<p>
<br>
c.	What my goals in doing this would be 1) to demonstrate the utility of computer and software technologies and 2) to use these technologies to bring out the natural strategies (mathematical or otherwise) the students are already using.  This enhanced understanding of where they are coming from would allow me to adapt my own instruction to their needs.
<p>
<br>
d.	What I am describing is a structured form of cooperative learning that could be adapted to asynchronous communication technologies (e.g., Classnet).  Just as we use Classnet to bring more depth to our in-class discussions; we also take from it a better understanding of how our classmates have understood and applied what we have all been attempting to learn.  This form of cooperative learning allows us all, Prof. Andre included, to monitor and reflect on the task or problem we have before us (i.e., trying to determine the use of all this ~stuff~).  In my technology class the same imperatives apply.  We are all trying to find a way to use technology to our benefit.
<p>
<br>
e.	Classnet and other technological features of Psych 533 provide interactive examples from which we all can learn.  Interactive technologies are exciting in my situation because they address the unique needs of the at-risk members of my own learner population.  I would design a CD-ROM of problem that is required to be solved at a distance via the internet.  The CD-ROM would have a simulated browser and video clips that describe the problem to be solved; in this case, the delivery of transcribed medical records to a managed care provider in another state.  To enhance efficiency records must be digitized and made to conform to accepted notions of legibility and completeness.  As future telecommuters, my students would be required to address all the sub-problems related to the geographical distances between each member of the healthcare team.  This CD-ROM would provide multiple examples of the various challenges a telecommuter can face in the performance of her (or his) duties.

5. Problem Solving.  Source: Pressley.  “Problem solving is a means for learning about new ways of solving problems, not just an activity that the student does after being taught methods of problem solving.”  While teaching mathematics, teachers often assign homework from a textbook after they have gone over a specific section that deals with a particular problem solving method, but this is not what problem solving is.  Students should be able to use what they learn in class in everyday situations.  They must be given opportunities to make learning relevant and meaningful.  Problem solving skills should be used so that students realize that there is more than one way to get an answer to a problem.  They should also be able to think about how they go about solving problems and develop strategies for solving problems in general.
<p>
<br>
Word Problems. Source: Pressley.  Word problems help students apply mathematical symbols and relationships to words.  In life, we often do not use math to solve problems like 3+2=?, instead we are usually faced with trying to figure out how many apples we will have if we have three in the refrigerator and we buy two at the grocery store.  Students need to be able to take real world problems and apply mathematical symbols and algorithms.  They need to see the relationship between a given situation and see how their mathematical understanding applies.
<p>
<br>
<p>
Cooperative Learning. Source: Pressley.  Cooperative learning is used in mathematics to promote interactivity among children.  It gives students the opportunity to work together to solve given problems.  This leads to the understanding that problem solving can take place in many ways.  Students come to realize that there is more than one way to solve problems.  A focus is placed more on the actual strategies employed in solving the problem than the actual answer obtained.  Students also get to get feed back from one another.
<p>
Situated Learning. Source: Pressley.  Situated learning involves completing a task in a particular setting or situation.  It involves knowledge being tied to a direct application of it.  For example, it might be quite easy for a chef to convert different units of measure while cooking but if given a standardized test where they are asked to do the same type of conversions, s/he might not do as well.  In other words, his/her knowledge about conversions is tied to her/his cooking experience.  
<br>
Example:  With assistance from parents, students will be asked to participate in a fund-raiser that involves getting pledges from their relatives and friends.  The pledge will be based on the number of push-ups they can do.  For instance, if someone pledges 10 cents and the child does 10 push-ups, the person would owe $1.00.  Those submitting pledges will be encouraged to give the students different scenarios where the student must figure out how much the person will owe.  This involves various types of algorithms.
<p>
<br>
Example for cooperative learning, word problems and problem solving: Students will work in groups of three to solve one of the adventures in the Jasper series (presented in the form of a word problem).  Each student in the group will have a specific role (cooperative learning).  Once all groups have obtained an answer, they will share with the rest of the class.  Students will note how not all of the groups solved the problem in exactly the same way.  THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO REACH AN ANSWER. Students will also discuss how and why they chose certain strategies to use in their groups (problem solving).  The Jasper series was chosen because the adventures present real life situations.

===message:Important Ideas
<p>
1. Self-Regulation: Monitoring and Control
<p>
Source: This idea was presented in Chap. 13, Pressley¡¯s book.
Explanation: It is one of the important features that metacognition has. Students who have a self-regulation would monitor their learning itself and learning procedures. Also they control the use of learning strategies so that they could use strategies in effective ways. According to Schoenfeld (P 322 in Pressley), a good math-problem solver (A professional mathematician) monitors whether problem solving progress is toward the solution of the problem, and if not, s/he would search for better strategies and apply them to the problem solving. 
<p>
2. Cooperative Learning and Mathematics Education
<p>
Source: This idea was presented in Chap. 13, Pressley¡¯s book.
Explanation: Cooperative learning is especially used for mathematics learning environment effectively. In math-problem solving procedures, social interaction with peers and a teacher could affect student math-concepts understanding. Cooperative learning in math has the following advantages for students.
<p>
-Students come to value the process of problem solving.
<br>
-Students have less anxiety toward math.
<br>
-Students experience more challenging problems with cooperation.
<br>
-Students have a chance to explain something to peers, which foster deep understanding of the problem.
<br>
-Students realize that each problem has a variety of way of solution.
<p>
3. LOGO Programming and Geometry Concepts
<p>
Source: This idea was presented in Chap. 13, Pressley¡¯s book.
Explanation: According to several literature resultings shown in the Pressely book, LOGO programming experience could increase knowledge of geometric concepts. For example, students who received LOGO instruction can draw geometric figure more easily and know better about the features of each figure. And if LOGO instruction is done with cooperative learning, students would experience cognitive development through interaction with peers.
<p>
4. Word Problems and Mathematics Instruction 
<p>
Source: This idea was presented in Chap. 13, Pressley¡¯s book.
Explanation: Rather than providing drill and practice on the basic math concepts, giving students meaningful word problems is a good method that enables students to connect their math knowledge to real world situation, so that they can perceive math concepts as learnable and meaningful things for their lives. And the appropriate time for this word problem instruction is after middle elementary grade level.
<br>
Description of Idea Application to My Teaching
<p>
I am teaching Geometry class to forth graders. My teaching objective is to enable students to draw various geometric figures: Squares, circles, rectangles, pentagons, and others and understand the features of each figure. Before formal instruction, I let them explore LOGO programming by using 'LOGO Writer', which is a LOGO programming software. With this program, students program turtle to draw some figures on the screen by themselves. By experiencing this LOGO programming before formal instruction, students can construct understanding of geometric figures in a meaningful way. (Application of no. 3 idea)
<p>
First, I give them a word problem like the following.
<p>
Question 1: Now is Christmas morning. With excitement, you come out to your living room to see the present from Santa. Wow, Santa gave you a cute puppy for a Christmas present. What a lovely puppy you have! However, your puppy has no house to live in. So your father and you decide to design the puppy house by yourselves. Your father suggests you draw the house by using 'LOGO Writer' you learned at your school. Now your task is to draw the puppy house with LOGO Writer. Let's do it!!
<p>
This word problem makes students think that solving math problem is meaningful to them. Rather than giving some questions like 'Draw one triangle.' or 'Draw a square,' providing students with meaningful problems like the above can grasp more student motivation to do math, I think. (Application of no. 4 idea)
<p>
In order to draw the puppy house with LOGO Writer, students are asked to make a group of two or three peers. They can solve this problem together as a group. As a group, they can generate multiple strategies for the solution of this problem. They feel less anxiety and exchange explanation how they think in order to make a triangle for the roof. This exchange of opinion is good for their deep understanding. (Application of no. 2 idea)
<p>
Finally, they start to program a turtle to draw the puppy house on the screen. Actually, they can see how the progress of drawing the house is doing by watching the graphic a turtle draw on the screen. By watching the graphic, they can monitor their problem solving procedures because if they do wrong procedures, the turtle draw the wrong figure. If then, they can perceive they are processing the wrong procedure for the solution and modify their procedure by changing the LOGO programming procedures. With this recursive monitoring of what they are doing toward the solution of the problem: Drawing the puppy house, students can self-regulate their metacognitive knowledge effectively. (Application of no. 1 idea)
<p>
After this LOGO experience, they will get the formal instruction from a teacher. Based on the construction of knowledge about geometry figures through LOGO programming, students can expand and deepen the geometry concepts from a teacher instruction.

5a. Strategy: Polya's problem solving. Source: Pressley. Polya presented four general steps to problem solving: Understand the problem, devise a plan, carry out the plan and look back. 
<p>
5b. Strategy: Schoenfeld's Monitoring and control. Source: Pressley. This is a metastrategy in which the student essentially stands beside him or herself and watches the the thinking that is going on concerning the problem being addressed. This process helps the student stay on a productive path or move in other directions when the current path no longer seems to be moving toward success.
<p>
5c. Stragegy: Cooperative Learning. Source: Pressley. As in chapter 5, the students collaborate to solve mathematical problems.
<p>
5d. Strategy: Learning from examples. Source: Pressley. Working out problems of similar nature tends to help students become proficient in the specific kinds of problem solving activities.
<p>
6. When I taught high school geometry I went about teaching the measurement of similar triangles this way: after an introduction to what constituted a proportion I would have the students construct out of straws and sticks several pairs of proportional triangles. They would measure the sides and from this we would induce the rules governing the relationships between sides (they are proportional, of course). After that, I would show them where similar triangles existed in the classroom, halls, whereever we could find them. Students would then procede to measure these examples to get a firmer grasp of the proportionality properities and how they could be applied. This activity was generally done in pairs providing some cooperative learning experience.
<p>
The final activity involved measuring the distance between my outside window and a wall that it looked out to (about 20 feet away - great view). As we were on the third floor of the school it was impossible for the students to actually measure this distance. I gave them no hints but gave them balls of string and measuring tapes, put them into groups of four and turned them loose (I should probably note that these were TAG kids). I didn't call it this at the time but the process that they used to figure out the distance involved a great deal of monitoring and control, as there were many false starts, dead-ends from which they would have to back up and constant questioning of whether they were actually getting anywhere. With some of the students I would have to intervene and assist them. I often used an elaboration of Polya's problem-solving strategy to help them work through the process (usually breaking the first step into the more means-ends approach of understanding what it was they were trying to get to and what they knew at the beginning; and breaking the second step down into what resources were available and what math principles could be applied to the situation). It was a fun exercise and usually several ways of solving the problem were uncovered. And though here I attribute the strategies used to those found in Pressley, in actuality I was generally flying by the seat of my pants and stumbling into some of these strategies as I went.

The examples are good and simple applications to the major points listed 
and gives clear practicality to the concepts.  I am not clear on why the 
students will take notes.  What will the students use the notes for?  To 
study or just for their own learning enhancements.

These example work will with the concepts except for exploration.  It may 
be difficult to apply this concept with somethng like driving.  What 
could the driving student explore while on the road where the rules of 
the road are clearly  and expicitly stated and there is penalty for 
straying from these rules.  Driving test simply test skills and knowledge 
of the laws.  There may not be much room for exploration.

If the teacher points out these abilities, what if the child felt he or 
she had abilities to offer to the group other than what the teacher 
recognizes.  Wouldn't that cause problems. By forcing the students to 
focus on one ability, other abilities may be overlooked.
