5a. Time and knowledge.  
<br>
Source: Pressley - Chapter 4.
<br>
Explanation: Time and knowledge improve performance for people of all ages. Over the passage of time, if a task or activity is repeated over and over, the learner builds on his/her knowledge base about the task or activity. With such a knowledge base, people are more apt to manifest strategies than people without such a base. Such strategies include: automatic associations, classifications and analogies.

5b. Clustering and organization.  
<br>
Source : Pressley - Chapter 4
<br>
Explanation: With increasing age, learners are more likely to remember bits of information if they chunk it. This involves categorizing information into groups that share commonalities. An example follows: memorizing a list of groceries by food groups (milk products, breads, fruits and vegetables, meats).

5c. Think alouds.  
<br>
Source: Pressley - Chapter 4
<br>
Explanation: Researchers have shown that think-alouds often help them compare how learners process problems depending on whether they have a previous knowledge base or not. This may apply to classroom teachers as well. If a teacher wants to introduce a new topic and assumes some students have more experience related to the topic than others, he or she can break the class into small discussion groups before even introducing the topic. By circulating to hear a piece of the discussion for the groups, the teacher may grasp a better sense for ranges of previous knowlegde of the group.

5d. Knowledge-base activation strategies.  
<br>
Source: Pressley - Chapter 4
<br>
Explanation: Knowledge-base activation strategies can interfere with new learning. Some previous knowledge can sometimes inhibit new learning. If students have known a given fact for a long time, even if the fact is a misconception, they may have troubles deleting that fact from their memory and replacing it with a new, more accurate one. In this case, it may be helpful for teachers to help students articulate their misconceptions and discuss why the newly learned fact should replace them.
<p>
5e. Self-regulated learning.  
<br>
Source: Pressley - Chapter 4
<br>
Explanation: Experts demonstrate self-regulated learning and problem solving. They are able to keep themselves on task and guide their own thinking. Learners should be encouraged to examine learning and pull it apart on their own. They should not rely on non-stop direction from a teacher. Learners should also be encouraged to explore how to develop their own procedures for solving problems using previous knowledge bases.

6. I will be conducting a workshop for parents on the use of technology in the home environment. Before beginning the session, I will try to guage the various pre-existing knowledge-bases of the participants in this area by having discuss what they expect to learn during the session. Some of the participants will have extensive knowledges; whereas, others will have minimal knowledge. Such understanding will allow me to know for whom I should provide more guidance. Once I have a grasp for the various levels of participant knowledge-base, I will inform the learners that becoming comfortable with technology will probably take some time and persistence and that this workshop is only a step in the process. I will begin by discussing a few of the basic differences between Macs and Windows computers for those persons who have familiarity with computers other than those available in the workshop. Questions will be encouraged throughout. Next, I will try to chunk basic information into categories: hardware, software, desktop, etc. Lastly, I will encourage participants to “play” with the computer by exploration. I will discuss the importance of learning how to learn to use new applications
