===message:I think this is a fair overview of the reading material assigned this week. There is one point made about the reading assignment from Hegland that I feel was misinterpreted, however. That is the use of "manipulatives" in learning. I felt the article and researched showed that manipulatives aided in teaching, rather than hindered the learning process. The manipulatives referred to the materials used in teaching (manipulatives vs. pictorial); and are a separate entity from the issues of motor response. In dealing with motor response, the instructor wants to make certain that the motor response required focuses, rather than distracts from the learning process itself.

I found the rest of this assignment to be accurate and well thought out by its author. There were a few grammatical errors, or typographical errors that I was disappointed to see in this level of a course. But, perhaps the author was "bogged down" with the "distractions" of using a new mode, or technology, and attempting to integrate the multiple demands made on them to complete this assignment, or learning experience. They will most certainly improve when this task has become more "automatized" to them.

I found the part of the author's writing regarding how he/she will use this material interesting. They seemed to be able to take the information they gleened from the readings, and find a manner in which to apply it to their own situation. They showed creativity and ingenuity in their response. Overall, I felt the author did a fair to good job.

===message:  This individual apparently came away from the first assignment with a solid grasp of the material presented in the reading (both the text and the Heglend article) and the class discussion. I was impressed with the presentation of the main points of the subject matter, not only in the selection choice, but also the in the fact that the individual encompased all three sources. 
  I found the application section to be a little unclear in certain areas. This individual has an excellent application base from which to relate the points listed. Yet, the applications were slightly fuzzy in that each of the main points was not clearly labeled and thouroughly explained. I was unsure as to how the individual was instituting each of the points as teaching aids. In the first application, s/he discussed an automatized motor skill but did not discuss the process of automatization as it related to his/her teaching. Also s/he stated in the first section that the use of manipulatives was a detriment, but offered manipulatives as an aid to his/her lesson in the application section. 
  I am sure the applications were clear to the individual who wrote them because of his/her familiarity with his/her own teaching and the material covered in the readings and class discussion, but for the sake of those of us who are unfamiliar with the individual's work, perhaps in the future s/he could clearly label each of the points and explain exactly how they were instituted in the lesson in such a way as to fascilitate learning.

===message:	It is obvious that s/he has a firm grasp of the material presented in the text and the readings.  In his/her applications, it is clear that his/her students already familiar with keyboarding so this wouldn't be an unfamiliar manipulative that would interfear with new learning.  He/She is then leading the students into new learning about what they can do with keyboarding, e-mail, and sending to adresses that aren't clear. 
	I must say, from my own very recent experiences with using unfamiliar manipulatives, that they are a great hinderence to the learning of new material.  One is so caught up in trying to master a new communication form that there is little time for really thinking about what is supposed to be learned.
