===message:I think this assignment is very well done. The author was able to simplify the research and does a fair job of explaining what he/she felt the research was saying.The examples given are clear and concise. (I especially liked the padlock example).

I had a hard time finding the list, or names, of the four to six important ideas. I could only pick out one rather generalized idea.
I feel one of the strong points of the author's applications was the idea of repetition for the art students. And, then allowing them to develop their own schemata for remembering and utilizing what they already know, while coupling it with the new information the teacher will be imparting to them.

I am a bit hard pressed to think of ways this person could improve the applications suggested. I think they are good. I may be having some trouble thinking of improvements since much of the technical lingo was lost on me in regards to art education. I did have a few thoughts come to me on how I might use some of the author's applications in my own classroom. The idea that learning and study skills do not appear to transfer well from one domain, or subject, to another. And, that the students need to be taught why, when and how to use particular skills within the context of what is being taught. The author's concept that when teaching "learning skills" to students, one thing the intervention needs to do is promote a high degree of learner activity. These are things, teaching science, that I constantly strive to accomplish. The students do not seem to transfer concepts and learning skills in this type of setting when the material is presented in a purely didactic manner. I will not elaborate here on the specific methods I have experimented with in the classroom; as my Assignment 2 was on this same area, and covered these readings as well.
 
Again, I am having some trouble with the format that the assignments (and, hence, probably the critiques) are showing up here in ClassNet. It is hard to evaluate them fully, as the true format or style does not seem to show up. For example, the writing style, grammar, etc. are not as readily visible and may be short changing the authors.
I also was under the impression that Assignment 3, which I believe this is to be, were the readings listed for Week 4 which deal with Pressley Chpt. 4 (Knowledge and Cognition),and the paper by Willoughby, Waller, Wood about prior knowledge effects on immediate and delayed learning? This assigment is the previous week's assigment (assignment 2). However, this person has done a good job with the assignment they did.

===message:SCHEMATA ARE USUALLY THOUGHT OF AS BEING IN SEMANTIC MEMORY.  Declarative knowledge is primarily verbal.  You could make that clearer.  Your example illustration is good, but  you have to consider how to lead students to knowledge.  The checklist may work somewhat, but if students don’t know its basis, you have to help them internalize the knowledge needed to use the checklist.  It is a tough question.
