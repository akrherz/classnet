===message:To better understand these, I must understand the reinforcers thoroughly.   Am I on the right track?  
•	The distinction between unconditional reinforces  and conditional reinforcers are that unconditional reinforcers  are stimuli satisfy biological (physical or emotional) needs.  With conditional reinforcers, no biological needs are directly satisfied by the conditional reinforcers allows for the unconditionals to meet these needs.  The 2 are paired - one allows access to receive the other.

For your speech class, the positive reinforcement could perhaps be given using the ratio scale so that it produces the higher rates of responding and encourages the students to continue to practice their articulation.  The responses could be praises such as assents of dissents to show the listeners understood their ideas and that they were presented concisely.  

Behavior modification can be more effective if done before the "bad behavior is done.   If the students are told before each presentation that they are to summarize the presentation or critic it for points, they are more likely to listen and pay close attention.

===message:Good job of explaining the concepts. Particularly in realizing that behavior modification does involve shaping behavior.  I would caution anyone who uses time out in behavior modification or classroom management.  Time out is the most widely misused behavior management technique.  People need to make sure that they understand that time out is a removal from the opportunity to receive reinforcement. Often the way time out is used, time out is actually reinforcing. For example, a time out in the hall or in the school office can be more interesting and provide more opportunities for reinforcement than being left in the classroom.  It is always important in behavior modification to analyze what is and isn't reinforcing and what function the undesirable behavior serves and provide reinforcement for alternative, incompatible behaviors.  In your applications, I would suggest encouraging students to provide verbal instead of written praise to help make public speaking more comfortable and reinforcing.  Be careful with the use of the videotapes in the application of intermittent reinforcement. Some of us hate to be on videotape and this could be aversive.  Good job! Excellent application for the development of language competencies for a second language through the use of both metacognitive strategies and modeling.
