===message:You did a nice job of showing how you would incorporate a number of learning strategies into your classroom situation.  Your approach shows that a variety of approaches, applied at the appropriate times and often in combination with other learning strategies, can create an effective learning environment.  This approach also helps catch learners who have different learning styles -- this is important because when a teacher falls into a pattern of reinforcing only one or two learning strategies, a number of students can be left behind.  You did a good job of describing the basic concepts covered, and your application of those concepts looks solid to me!
