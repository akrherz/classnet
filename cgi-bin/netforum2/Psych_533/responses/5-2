===message:Thanks for prompt posting!I'm not going to look up your ID, but you should know that it would be easy for anyone to do so since you entered your e-mail address on the class posting.  If we're trying to maintain some semblance of anonymity, we should avoid offering too many clues. Also, it would help the class test the idea of using this forum if we do not circumvent it by using private e-mail.

===message:     You explained the four concepts, chosen from the Pressley readings of chapter 1, clearly and concisely. In the explanation of STRATEGIES, you gave two examples that illustrate how such controllable operations could be used in a classroom setting to complete a particular task. I would like to follow your lead and give examples to the other three concepts that you referenced.
     Regarding your second explanation referring to METACOGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT STRATEGIES, an example to illustrate this concept would be when a teacher prompts students to think about note-taking. A question he/she might ask students follows, "How would you go about taking notes while you are reading a chapter in a book as opposed to while you are watching a video?" Obviously, the first task would take some kind of outlining and organization; whereas, the second would consist mainly of jotting down information that stands out.
     In the third explanation, where you talk about GOOD INFORMATION PROCESSORS AND HOW THEY LIVE IN A RICH ENVIRONMENT, a teacher could foster that environment in a foreign language classroom by exposing students not only to grammar and speaking, but also music, food and culture. Lastly, when you discuss how GOOD TEACHERS INTERCONNECT VARIOUS TYPES OF TEACHING, an example might come from a pre-school setting where children of various age ranges and ability levels are mixed together. The day's schedule might consist of singing, coloring, quiet time, outside play and a variety of other stimulating, yet different learning/play. 
     I would like to conclude by saying that you did a nice job of providing an example of how fifth grade students could "discover" how to find the area of shapes. Your example gave a unique approach to learning mathematics constructively while including concepts highlighted above from the chapter.

===message:<pre>Response to Assign 1 Cp533The four ideas listed by Cp533 also strike me as being significant and reasonably accurate as far as they go. I was confused, though, by "Chapter 1" being cited as the source for each idea, especially since the assignment was for Chapter 2. Probable sources for the ideas and my comments about the ideas are as follows:5.a. Strategies           Chapter 2 page 24    Cp533 states that "strategies are often chosen on their ability to reach the desired goal . . . with maximum efficiency".  This is a desirable state of cognition, but one which I suspect all too rarely occurs.  Disturbingly many people don't use the best strategies, even ones they've been exposed to, unless they've also learned meta-cognitive knowledge about when the strategies are appropriate and effective.      Pressley and McCormick say learners need to assess a strategy's relative effectiveness, attribute degree of success to a strategy, then use the knowledge they gain about strategies when later choosing a strategy as an approach to a problem (page 32). That process is ideal, but I suspect far from common.5.b. Metacognitive knowledge about strategies           Chapter 2 page 29    Cp533's comments seem right on target.5.c. Good information processors live in richly stimulating environments           Chapter 1 page 4    Cp533's comments were probably in the right direction, but were vague and repetitious.    It's interesting to note that Pressley and McCormick say good learners place themselves in an appropriate environment (the time a teenager spent with her mother's computer was cited as an example on page 5). The idea is not surprising, but is worth noting because ignoring the time spent in the learning environment may lead to such erroneous conclusions as the idea that children learn languages more easily than do adults (example cited in lecture).    I was struck by Pressley and McCormick's statement that language acquisition is affected negatively for twins or members of a large family because "environmental pressures . . . reduce the amount that parents can play and verbally interact with their children".  I would have assumed that verbally proficient and active older siblings would increase the amount of speech a child would be exposed to vis-a-vis an only child, counteracting any effect of a parent's split attention.5.d. Good teachers interconnect various types of teaching         Chapter 1 page 10    Cp533's comments seem right on as far as they go. It's worth mentioning, though, as Pressley and McCormick do on page 10, that "most teachers do not teach the many strategies that can improve academic performance and learning."  Courses such as ISU's Psych 533, taught by good instructors, are sorely needed, and would be an excellent replacement for the "faculty development" programs experimented with in the Ames Community school district.6.  Application of ideasCp533's example application of ideas seems more likely to result in confusion than the desired self-discovery of effective strategies.  "Find out how much space a piece of 8.5 x11 in. notebook paper takes up" would be a frustratingly incomplete task instruction, I think.  If the students first had some direct explanation of the concept of area, even if not a specific demonstration of the formula  length x width = areathey would be more likely to succeed in inventing strategies.  I like the idea of having a sheet of graph paper larger than the notebook paper, which would allow students to count the blocks covered by the notebook paper.  A second size of paper could then be offered, allowing the students to compare the number of blocks occupied by the first sheet relative to the second sheet as a way of comparing the two areas.  By the time they've counted all the blocks, they'll be ready to see that using the formula can save much time.</pre>

===message:The four strategies you presented were carefully infused into your potential lesson plans.  In the first strategy, just a few more promts could be given to the students or maybe a few suggestions on how they could start the strategic process.  The direct explanatioins of area and perimeter should be explained prior to the lesson.
