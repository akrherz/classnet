===message:You have some excellent ideas in this presentation.  Your teaching approach may be enhanced if you select studies with which they are familiar or that have personal relevance for the students.  Studies that make the popular press may be good vehicles for this.  Also, much as we would hope otherwise, it takes time, lots of it, to develop expertise.  Getting ideas over several course may be what is needed to eliminate misconceptions and develop true expertise.

I believe the individual who posted this assignment came away from the material with a good understanding of the concepts s/he presented in 5a-d. The explanations of these concepts were clear, concise, and gave accurate summaries of the ideas discussed in chapter 4 of the Pressley text. It might be advantageous in the future for the individual to incorporate ideas and concepts from the articles and class discussions as well.
<p>
This individual had excellent personal experience from which to apply the concepts s/he discussed in previous section. However, I had a few questions related to clarifying some of these applications. In applying concept 5a, the individual stated that s/he would teach "the new concepts in methodology in the context of their prior knowledge and education". I believe this would be an effective application, but could you expand on this by giving an example of how you would accomplish this?
<p>
In application 5d, the individual stated that by utilizing application 5a, the students would be freed from focusing on unimpotant aspects, allowing them to focus instead on the "higher level and relevant information". I think that it would be very hard for the students to accomplish this until they had actually mastered the material.
<p>
In application 5b, I think that the individual was absolutely correct in assuming that prior incorrect knowledge interferes with learning new correct knowledge that contradicts the old. But where is the application in this? How can this be overcome or used to facilitate learning in these students?
<p>
I thought that the individual's application in 5c was excellent. Exposing the students to many experiments- ensuring they understang the ideology and methodology behind the experiments and their statistical designs- will begin the students' journey on the road to expertice. According to Pressley, though, the process of becoming an expert will take 10 to 20 years.

Assignment 3: A Critique of Assignment 3 written by Pp533
<p>
I agree with most of the author's explanations. I think the author well-selects 4 important ideas that have values to apply to better teaching and learning. The only thing I want to add to these explanations is for 5a: Benefit of Prior knowledge in learning new material. Prior knowledge may promote new material learning because the prior knowledge is related to the new material in terms of contents, as the author implies. Also I want add one more benefit of prior knowledge for new learning: Prior knowledge enables learners to use a specific strategy for better learning of the new material, which is impossible if the learner has no prior knowledge on the domain.
<p>
When I read the application parts of these ideas, I could find a few things to think again. 
<p>
First, I want to know how the author infers college students are experts on education. The author said because they have been students themselves for at least 12 years, they are relatively experts on education. However, they were students not teachers. Personally I think there are different prior knowledge accumulations on education between as a student and as a teacher. The purpose of this course is to help students to become experts in research methodology, according to the author. In order to understand research methodology more easily through research on education, I think the prior knowledge college students should have is not from experiences as a student but from expertise as a teacher (This is only my short thinking and I know I could be wrong. I love to get feedback for this comment.).
<p>
Second, the author said since inappropriate prior knowledge may interfere with new learning, s/he would try to teach only the correct knowledge from the first. This is a good idea. However, I don't think most of teachers teach any incorrect knowledge on purpose. Rather than through the incorrect instruction, through the process of cognition and long-term memory activation, students may have misconceptions toward nature. As an educator, if we find the misconception that interferes with new learning from students, we should try to help them to accept new concept and change their misconception.
<p>
Finally, I like the author's 5c application that makes students practice research design by themselves in order to let students expose to real world of research design. As the author mentioned, being the research experts takes a quite long time and needs rich environment for practice. I agree with the author on the point.
<p>
Though I see some ambiguous parts in this application, generally, I think, the author applies key ideas in ch. 4, Pressely's book to a realistic teaching unit meaningfully and appropriately.

===message:One issue struck me rather strongly in reading this description by pp533 that I thought I would just pass along: It seems to me that in trying to teach good research methodology to a Psych 101 class one is confronted with a bit of a chicken/egg dilemma. How does one really do psychological research without a firm understanding of the foundations of psychological theory? Can one even comprehend at all what the research should be getting at? Prior knowledge in this sense means spending a good deal of time understanding what psychology is all about. On the other hand, how does one understand psychology if one can't fathom how the research is done? I've found that this seems to be the cunundrum for many ed psych students - they have neither the grasp of what makes good research (which mostly relies on an fairly sophisticated understanding of stats) nor do they really know what psychology is about (not just the content but the philosophical world view out of which it works). Therefore, they tend to misconceive much of whatever it is they learn about both psych and research. I wonder if a psych 101 course really requires a much more fundamental approach than offered here so that when research and psych theories are taught they do have a much more robust prior knowledge to fall back on.
