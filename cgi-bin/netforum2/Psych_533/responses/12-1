===message:You gave an accurate description of each of the ideas presented in the materials. These ideas highlight the main point of the chapter and also point to what you consider to be "the fact that we need to make learning "real" for students if we expect them to actually gain and store knowledge". I would like to comment on the activity where students "create a model of the solar system for the classroom". This activity would not only help them to transfer knowledge from the semantic memory to the episodic memory, but it would also help them to enhance the mental model that was created by the computer, hence making it even more clear.
<p>
     The only thing I would add to the activity would be for students to conduct research on a chosen planet and have the students present the research to one another. This would help amplify their general knowledge of the content. Your activity was well thought out and creative.
<p>
     Another activity that might encompass similar qualities would be to study the human body. The teacher might start off by asking students to discuss what organs perform what functions to guage what they already know about the human body (general content). Then, he or she could write a poem or make a rhyme about how 2 or more organs work together to perform a function. Next, students could research the human body using a CD-ROM. This would not only enhance their content knowledge, but also help them to develop their mental model. Lastly, they might have a contest to see how could place the organs in the right place the fastest (in small groups using a plastic human body model).

===message:5a.  Semantic and episodic memory relate to procedural knowledge as well as declarative knowledge.  In learning how to do something, we would have experiences of trying to do it stored in our episodic memory.  As we gain a generalized skill in whatever it is, it would become a structure (node) in our semantic memory.  At least that is one of the theories.  
<br>
Using the computer software to help create a mental model of the solar system is a good idea.  It is hard to get a sense of the geometry of the solar system without physical props.  I have a few questions about your example.  It is not clear to me how the mnemonic ties to the concepts you discussed.  The mnemonic is useful, but doesn’t seem to be part of the ideas.  What is most confusing is the statement about moving knowledge from semantic memory to episodic memory.  If anything the process is in the opposite direction.  We have experiences.  If we are guided in reflecting on them and provided with some appropriate terminology, we can construct structures in semantic memory that represent an abstracted form of those experiences.  Reactivating students possible knowledge of astronomy, e.g. the earth-moon, system may help.  You would gain an understanding of where the students were.
<br>
How you structured the team activity would be critical.  Each team might gain an understanding of its planet, but you want them to gain more.  You want them to see the overall structure of the solar system.  You would need to build in ways for the teams to interact.  You imply you will do this, but may need to think it through more clearly.

===message:The ideas in this reply are useful.  However, it is critical that students be guided in their understanding to construct internal represenations that are consistent with the culture in questions, e.g. the culture of astronomer, the culture of human biologists.

===message:	I thought this was a very good summary of the main points in the reading, especially in Pressley.  I am doing this critique late, and this was an excellent review of the chapter.   
	The review part of the situational learning was excellent.  Often teachers forget to review and allow time for students to share prior knowledge about a subject before presenting new information. As you have stated, this allows an activation of prior learning, mental models, activates schema between relevant concepts, and prompts students to recall semantic and episodic memory.  In addition, this also gives the students a good feeling, to be able to share information "before the learning".  They feel proud that they already know something.  It also allows the teacher to determine the current knowledge base, false knowledge or misconceptions, and identify "helpers" for those with a lower knowledge base.  
   I like the way you have students create something.  In the time that it takes for them to make a "planet" they will have reviewed all of the facts about that planet in order to create it, discussed, argued, researched the answers, and committed the information to episodic memory.  
	  If I were to add anything to the lesson on planets, it would be a sharing or presentation by each group of their planet.  Explaining what they did and why "it is red because..." and what they know about the planet.  I would also ask them what questions came up for which they did not know the answer- problems and successes.
