===message:     This is a good summary.  Your current reading situation is a cute example.  But it is more than cute, because you are giving your son a firm basis for future reading.

===message:I have read this assignment.  Like you, I have a small child who will soon be learning to read.  The more associations Connor can make to the phonetic codes the stronger the link will be when he begins more formal instruction.  Good application.

===message:The ideas that you describe are all fascinating and seem to happen magically among young people. I think your real life application to the ideas is an excellent one. I am amazed at your consistency and determination. I know there is a strong discourse among parents these days about how important it is to start reading early. I have personnally seen the positives effects of people spending a lot of time reading with their children. I imagine that the effects will be even more positive because you are not only consistent, but you apply, in a methodological way, strategies that have been researched.

I could see these ideas benefitting me as well as I am trying to teach my daughter French as she grows with a native language of English. Like you, I frequently read to my daughter in both English and French. I see much more interaction at this point, however, in English. She is still at a developmental stage where I see her relying heavily on visual cues like: stop, Pocahontas, Dalmations (and several other Disney movie names :-). In my mind, the challenge will be for my daughter to separate phonemic structures in English from those in French. Although, I have read some research that claims children somehow learn to do this quickly and naturally. Whatever the case, I am sure the introduction of this second language will only enhance her language deciphering abilities.
