I found Kp533's application of Pressley extremely well developed.  I wonder if this does not result from the power behaviorists have over today's curriculum.  What I am suggesting is that our experience provides many more examples for the application of these ideas than others.  This is familiar territory.  
<p>
<br>

Kp533, for example, has engaged in a behavior that is reinforced in the token economy (grades).  Differential reinforcement has also been used as others have been receiving approval reinforcers for completing each assignment.  
<p>
<br>

Classnet is itself an immediate, though asynchonous, form of reinforcement. According to social learning theory we all learn what behavior is valued in our own class.
<p>
<br>
Over time, our practice with posting assignments has allowed us to automatize formatting procedures that initially proved so troublesome.  Practice makes perfect?

===message:The example given in the explaination of DRO was good - very simple yet clear.... the teacher would reinforce the pro-social behaviors such as sharing a toy, etc. with a child who has problems with aggressive social behaviors during play.
