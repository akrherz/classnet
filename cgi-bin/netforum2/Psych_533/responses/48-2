===message:     This is a very good summary.  Your lesson plans show a good deal of thought.  You have started with what would be the easiest for your students to understand.  Then you lead them through each increasingly abstract strategy until they have covered learning to read from every possible angle.  This will give them a firm basis on which to build their reading competence.

===message:I would be interested to know what instruments you might use to test this initial awareness.  As you suggest, knowing where the  students are is vitally important in tailoring further instruction.  With respect to the use of flashcards, I would additionally label everything in the class that I could with as many names as possible to build these associations.  


If I recall my own training, we used to respond as a class with the sound of a letter combination when it was presented.  Usually this involved combinations of 2 to 3 letters such as ph or sh or ing.  


How we implement these strategies in the classroom seems to me to be nearly as important as the strategies themselves.  It seems as if we are discussing a sort of rules training.  We start with basic rules.  Then we combine two or three until they are somewhat automatized and then make combinations of combinations.  Perhaps there should also be a component of negotiation involved here, perhaps a small discussion of which sound the students think is represented by a particular phoneme.  Done with the intent of helping student develop personal sub-rules would give them the confidence needed to attempt subsequent decodings

<p>
I agree with your explanations of key ideas in ch. 14. And I think your application unit is well organized to help students be ready for more complicated reading tasks like reading comprehension. Especially I like the order you suggested for your teaching unit. 
<p>
I would like to make a few comments on your teaching unit. First, I think it is a good start that you begin your reading instruction after checking studnets' prior knowledge.
However, I want to know how you test students' level of phonemic awareness. I don't see any description of the test on your paper. Second, I like your additional instruction for low-level-phonemic awareness students. It might be an individualized after-class tutor. This additional instruction should last for a while through several teaching sections rather than one-time teaching because the phonemic awareness skill demands continuous efforts to acquire. Third, logographic reading strategy you used needs more caution to be implemented in your teaching unit. Basically, this strategy is related to dual coding theory that empowers the acquisition of words in this situation. In my thought, so as that this strategy works for word recognition, this logographic instruction should be accompanied by follow-up activities that make sure if students really acquire the words without visual cues. And I want to know how you will teach abstract words like 'clean' or 'lonely' with this strategy. Sometimes, I found there are unrealistic visual cues that make learners be confused by ambiguous visual representation. Though, I think you apply valuable reading strategies to your 1st grade reading class appropriately. Good job.

Response to IP 533
<br>
The explanations in IP 533's assignment were clear and well stated.  I think that the way IP 533 said that s/he would implement the concepts was fantastic.  It is important that students are given the opportunity to explore reading strategies through various means.  By presenting students with information in appropriate stages, they can become better readers.  The plan of implementation showed this by providing the learners with opportunities to explore phonemic awareness, lographic reading, alphabetic reading, and orthographic reading in successive stages that are developmentally appropriate.
