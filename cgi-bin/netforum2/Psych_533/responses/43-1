I found you summarized components of apprenticeship clearly and concisely. I agree with that there is a need for apprenticeship to learn how to drive. I think all the components of apprenticeship are not necessary foe each application of apprenticeship. For this driving course, the component of articulation is a little bit artificial. Sometimes, apprenticeship is a more natural procedure than this driving apprenticeship. And also I think the procedure of apprenticeship is recursive not linear.

===message:Driver's Ed is a really interesting example of the use of apprenticeship. It seems to me that children get apprenticed in the skill of driving almost from birth by their parents - at least around here, where a car is almost essential. Like real apprenticeships, the learning may not always be ideal, but it is informal and done through a long period of watching and, if the parent is willing, some gradual involvement. For example, my son loves to shift gears for me right now, so when the traffic isn't bad I let him sit beside me and shift. I also let him occassionally steer the car into the garage from the driveway. This sort of piece-by-piece entry into the realm of driving seems like the older way of apprenticing, which accomplished its training over a long period of time. I wonder if "apprenticeship" is really the right word for what is described in the textbook or in this example. Somehow it seems too quick, too formal, too isolated. That's not to criticize the way in which this lesson is carried out - it seems a dandy way to teach driver's ed. But somehow I feel psychology may have appropriated a word that signifies much more than they are attributing to it.

===message:The example has many strengths.  I have one question about the driving example.  The described use of the simulator doesn't seem like scaffolding.  The simulator is supposed to mimic real driving, just be safe.  So using the simulator is like practicing on the road, just safer.  Wouldn't scaffolding suggest that you have to somehow provide hints or help while the students is attempting to drive?  You might be able to do this with an expert system simulator, but a standard simulator doesn't do much of this.

These example work will with the concepts except for exploration.  It may be difficult to apply this concept with somethng like driving.  What could the driving student explore while on the road where the rules of the road are clearly  and expicitly stated and there is penalty for straying from these rules.  Driving test test skills and knowledge of the laws.  There may not be much room for exploration.
