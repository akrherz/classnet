===message:There is very little to argue with here. All of the theories of cognition rely on interaction with the environment, and your lesson is very firmly grounded in activities that give students experience working within the environment. I especially like your idea of taking students to the store early on so they have a context in which to fit their subsequent learning.

Rather than try to find things to quibble about, I want to ask if you have actually had experience with these disabled students and if so, which of these cognitive schemes seems most applicable to helping overcome the mental problems? Is it possible to explain these problems in terms of difficulty in forming these cognitive structures? If so, what kinds of special activities are necessary to overcome the difficulties that occur. Everything you have mentioned in your lesson seem perfectly suitable to normal students, differing only in time taken for mastery. If the disabilities are a matter of difficulty in constructing these various mental patterns then might there not be special activities necessary or suitable to work around them? This is an area of education with which I am not at all familiar.

===message:These are good descriptions of the basic theoretical positions.  The shopping example is a good one.  One question, why learning is situated, can the instruction strive for transfer of generalization across different types of shopping?  Not initially, but over the course of time.

The calculator practice should be in context.  You don’t make it clear that it is.  You do use in context practice later.  Of course there is a learning sequence involved,  some out of context practice with the calculator may be necessary, but it is a pretty meaningless task out of any context.  
Some real products (i.e. empty cans, cartons) and a "simulated" grocery store would be a useful adjunct to the flash cards.
