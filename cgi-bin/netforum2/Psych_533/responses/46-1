===message:I am slightly confused about the hypermedia stack assignment.  Are you having the pre-teachers create a stack that demonstrates how to teach a concept using either a constructivist or behaviorist method?  This idea gets a little lost in your explaination towards the end.  
The use of analogies in the example is not what I percieve analogies to be.  Using the alternative situations and having them classify them would be more of an example of teaching by example.  Analogies relate in that their structure or certain characteristics are similar to the concept being taught, but they are not examples of the concepts themselves.  
One of the things that I remember when reading this chapter is conflict is good.  Students learn when their views are challenged and they must re-examine their beliefs.  Sometimes, they already hold a correct belief, and the process helps them clarify and strengthen that bond and how it relates to new situations.  Sometimes the process helps them to discover their misconceptions and they are able to modify them based on the new information.  Conflict is good!

===message:Great job picking out the important concepts in Capter 12 and providing in-depth explanations for each of them.  In particular, your definition and explanation of conceptual conflict demonstrates your deep understanding of the concept. Nice job on the application.

===message:I had some difficulty determining where in your application the conceptual conflict arises.  Would it be correct to say the the students' misconceptions are related to constructivism vs. behavioralism instead of notions about what constitute hypermedia or its usefulness?

It seems clear, from own experience that Hypermedia could be used for both purposes.  Not only that, many contructivist themes can be "translated" into behaviorist language, if not practice.  For example, a neo-behavioralist might say that students are mimicing rather than constructing applying in an unconscious way the problem solving strategies they have previously observed from others.  In that sense, perhaps the discussion of definitions might not be as useful as a discussion of applications.

Concepts maps, however, seem very useful.  They take very little time to draw and are sort of a visual shorthand.  (Where does a person sign up to learn shorthand?) Moreover they can provide a sort of dual-coding if combined with mnemonic illustrations.  (Just look through my undergraduate notebooks.  Sometimes a doodle is more than a doodle.)  Many of my own maps tend to look like physical objects, such as lenses, globes, sextents, and clockworks.  Images from classical mechanics, microbiology, genetics, and particle physics.

I found your ideas very inspirational and the issues you raise worthy of a great deal of further thought.

===message:Nice examples using the concepts.  IF the students used some of their student teaching experiences in the use of the analogies they could understand the principle better as well.  It would become more personalized.
