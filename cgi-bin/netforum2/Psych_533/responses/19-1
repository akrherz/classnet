===message:I thought that the author of assinment four demonstrated a very good understanding of the material presented in Chapter 7 of the Pressley text and the article written by Graubard, Rosenberg, and Miller. The summaries given of the main points were clear and concise, indicating that the individual obtained the knowledge necessary to paraphrase the concepts into his/her own words and still convey the essential points of each of these constructs. The only comment I had about the summaries was that 5b (Perceptual Learning) wasn't within the pages assigned (p.155-174) and was actually part of the material assigned for assignment five.

I had a few clarification questions in the detailed applications section of the assignment. In 6a I was wondering what behavior the students were exhibiting that you were trying to condition. It appeared that you were trying to condition the students to offer examples or suggestions, when what I believe you were trying to condition was correct trouble-shooting techniques.

I thought that applications 6b through 6e were very good. The only other comments I had about the applications were in application 6f. You stated that you would require the "students to do this with limited or no instructions". Practice need not necessarily be excluded from the context of instruction; even with instruction, practice effects will still be in effect. Also- in the application you had them practicing not one task, but a few different tasks. For practice effects to be most effective, the student must be practicing the same task.
