<p>
Your explanations of the ideas are clearly written and accurate with the information in Pressley.  I might add one aspect to the explanation of self-instruction. I agree with your statement that the teacher often models certain behaviors to students and students, in turn, try to walk themselves through a given activity using the teacher’s model as a means of reference and example.  I gathered from the text, and from other research on the topic, that self-instruction can also include students’ ability to pull from a variety of experiences and contexts and create their own strategies and meaning-making in learning. In this case, students would not necessarily need to see someone else model the exact instruction before attempting self-instruction.
<p>
Your activity sounded interesting and fun for students. I sympathize with your concern for classroom management, especially in the K-12 setting.  It has been my experience; however, that in such an interactive learning environment, classroom management is less of an issue. That doesn’t mean it should be ignored, but simply approached in a different way. I did not quite understand your reasoning behind wanting to see all computer screens at all times or wanting to make it so that no other enticing software would be on the computers. I would think that clear communication about expectations for appropriate uses of computers and consequences for inappropriate behavior up front would help dissuade such behaviors.  That, frequented with regular circulation around the room should suffice.
<p>
Lastly, I would simply add that allowing students to “play” with the software before showing specifics about the program or assignment promotes more creativity and self-instruction among learners. That suggestion comes simply from past experiences with learners in that environment. 
<p>
I liked your choice of learning activity. It promotes creativity among students, independent learning and cooperative learning all in the same lesson. I especially liked your plans to circulate and have students do “think-alouds” when they get stuck or have questions. Good job on the posting.

===message:This was a concise summary of the chapter's information.  I think this was a good application of the strategy of intermittant reinforcement.  This also made good use of peer helpers.  The nature of the reinforcements encourages the students to behave well and also use their time wisely and progress independantly in their use of the computer.  Good job.
