===message:A Critique of Assignment 2 written by Ip533
<br>
The writer grasped key elements representing chapter 3 in Pressley's book well. Overall, s/he explained each concept in a simple and accurate way. Also, the explanations of all the concepts were made with the writer's own interpretation, which show his/her full understanding of this text. 
<br>
The writer applied these concepts to her/his own educational settings creatively. I think her/his application of proposition and macrproposition to reading comprehension is very effective teaching method, for by summarizing the text in their own word, I believe students can internalize the text in their own interpretation and decode the text in their future learning situation more easily. Also her/his writing instruction that makes students use semantic and episodic memory for generating ideas for a given topic is very impressive for me. 
<br>
The only two things I hope to share with the writer for the improvement of teaching are the followings. First, in the application of connectionist theory for teaching the recognition of words, the writer mentioned s/he would have students practice the word over and over in a number of different contexts. This is a good idea. However, I wonder if teaching a word in a number of different contexts is a way of connectionist. According to connectionist (p 42, Presseley Book), knowledge of particular letters must be well established before it is possible to learn to recognize words. This is said to be a bottom-up approach to cognitive processing. In my understanding, connectionist theory doesn't matter the context in learning occurs. For instance, if a student has a problem in recognizing a word 'high', I think connectionist teach the word 'high' by comparing other words sharing letters with HIGH with 'high'. The other thing I want to comment is about the utilization of dual coding theory. Though the writer gave an example of teaching a word 'dog' for using dual coding theory, I want to get more complicated examples to understand how to apply this dual coding theory to teaching and learning units.  
<br>
However, as I mentioned first, the writers did a good job for generating teaching units to apply the selected ideas to.

===message:Connectionist theory certainly does account for the effects of practice, but so does any learning theory.  Connectionist theory is one of many theoretical accounts of how cognitive structures change as a result of practice, its advantage is that it mimics, at a mathematical level, what seems to be happening at a biological level.   Thus any learning theory would argue that practice on words would improve students performance (your 6a).  There is a difference between a description of what happens, i.e. phenomena, and the theoretical account of how it comes to happens (why it happens in loose terms).  Thus the effects of practice and automatization are observable phenomena;  connectionist theory is one of many theories that seek to explain such phenomena.

5c.  it is not clear what you mean when you say that each individual episodic memory strengthens semantic memory.  It is probably true that for most of us as adults at least, each individual experience is interpreted using ideas in semantic memory and in this sense those concepts and principles may be strengthened.  However, the strengthening occurs only if the connection is made between experience snd semantic memory structures.  For concepts and principles to have meaning, they must be tied to the experienced world.  Is this what you mean?
<br>
6b.  Asking for a summary is a good idea as it leads the learner to process for macrostructures.  However, sometimes it is necessary to help the student gain the necessary skills of relating individual propositions to overall structure.  Revisit this idea when the class talks about reciprocal teaching.
<br>
6d.  This is a good idea.  It is necessary to provide appropriate experiences for episodic memory to create a meaningful semantic memory concept.  This idea needs to be extended to most instruction.

===message:Not a bad description and application of concepts.  There do seem to be some misunderstandings of one of the key concepts.  First, episodic memories do not strengthen semantic memories.  Particular episodes can be encoded into both episodic and semantic memories, but the episodic memories do not directly influence the tsrength of semantic memories.  I liked the application of connectionist theory and I agree that exposing the individual to words in different contexts is the best way to "build" their neural networks.  If words were presented in only one context or one style, an individual's network would only be able to recognize (both lexically and semantically) that word in that given context.  By using multiple contexts, the connections in the system become more generalized and are able to be activated by a number of different presentations of a single word.  However, I do no think that the application of dual code theory will accomplish what the writer thinks it will.  Having a student read a word and image the concept will strengthen the representations of that concept in the verbal and imagery systems, but it will NOT necessarily automatize the reading of the word.  In fact, I believe that dual code theory would suggest a different course of action if the goal is to automatize the reading of a word.  Since reading is necessarily carried out by the verbal system, then strenghtening the representation of the concept in the imagery store would do nothing to improve word reading and may be a waste of time.  Rather, if the goal is automatization, practice should be focused on reading--on strengthening the representation of the concept in the verbal store and the conncetion between that representation and the stimulus in the environment.
