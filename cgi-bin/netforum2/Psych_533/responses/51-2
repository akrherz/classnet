===message:Interesting lesson on plants. It's encouraging to see that teachers like to address previous theories or existing ideas about different topics before telling students the "truth". I think it catches more attention from students.

===message:I thought the application section 6 was excellent.  It gave a brief but thorough practical situation for the chosen concepts.  I especially like the idea of bringing in real plants for classification by distinctive features.  This will be a great learning situation for those students with a limited prior knowledge base.  It will also enable them to go from the abstracted version of the computer program where they manipulated variables, to the real and concrete version.  Real experiences, touching and observing the plants, soil (feeling the moisture or dryness and resulting condition of the plant, etc.) is invaluable.  As an extension you might classify the plants in various ways (leaf makeup- symmetrical, cluster, asymmetrical, etc.)...  Good Job.

===message:Lp533 shows the proper role of computer simulations in the classroom.  In this way, students can have their pre-existing erroneous opinions challenged, creating cognitive conflict.  It also strengthens domain-specific strategy skills.  One might also hope that, after sufficient alternate cases are presented, such strategies might be generalized to other domains. Nice Job!

===message:Just to be a little provocative here, it has always been my understanding that the desired flow of knowledge was from concrete to abstract. After all, one must abstract *from* something. It brings to mind the lament a biology professor once expressed to some friends of mine who were applying for grad school. He claimed that his department was having a lot of trouble getting grad students out into the field to actually observe animals in the wild - they would rather stay in the lab and manipulate their computer simulated environments. Also, I’m not sure why you would want children to experiment on the computer if they could do real experiments with real plants. Wouldn’t the concreteness of that kind of experimentation better fit their Piagetian stage?

===message:You explained four basic ideas very well. The explanations came from your own words that shows you successfully internalized these concepts into your schema, and you are ready to apply these Piagetian theories to your teaching units appropriately. 
<p>
If I can add some sentences to the explanation 5a, I like to speak about a way of equilibrium-Assimilation and Accommodation briefly. However, you did really nice job to catch the key points of each idea.
<p>
I like your applications. They are reasonable and theory-based. Basically your teaching is focused on changing students' common misconceptions about plant nutrition. This teaching unit is a good situation where you can apply your chosen ideas. Your students will experience cognitive conflicts by experiencing your computer simulation program that shows their present concept is wrong. This feature is a really wonderful solution to have students play an active role to deal with cognitive conflicts through the simulation. As students see the results of manipulation of nutrition variables, they are able to reach new equilibrium about plant nutrition firmly. If a teacher just explains there are many factors to influence plant growth, students may not perform such a strong perceptual equilibrium they can do when they are through the computer animation.
<p>
Finally, your teaching method to instruct a variety of types of plants is touchable. It is concrete and hands-on activity. Through touching and seeing face to face, students will independently abstract distinctive features of each plant class. Also this hands-on discovery and discussion may help students maintain these learning outcomes more permanently than simple textbook-based instructions.
<p>
Great job!
