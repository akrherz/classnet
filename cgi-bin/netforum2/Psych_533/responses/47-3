===message:The individual who posted this assignment provided an excellent and thoroughly explained presentation of the main ideas of focus from chapter 13 of the Pressley text. He/she obviously came away with a very solid grasp of the concepts presented by the author as to the facilitation of mathematical understanding. In the application section, an example was given of situated learning. I thought that this application had a good basis but the it would help me to more fully understand the concept if the individual would explain how the students were able to compute under the pledge conditions but not under others. This was a fundamental aspect of situated learning as I understood it- that conversions are tied to experience and situations. I thought that the examples given for cooperative learning, word problems, and problem solving were also on target. Yet, it would be helpful if these could be flushed out and elaborated on a little bit- maybe give an example of a word problem that would be used, etc. All in all, though, this individual did a very fine job.

===message:IN the problem solving group, the students will also learn from each other which method to use to solve the problems.  The students who are not as advanced in problems solving skills can be matched with some who are so that cooperative learning also becomes reciprical teeaching.

===message:Nice job.  It is good to have students working cooperatively so that they can see the many unique ways people get to a solution.
