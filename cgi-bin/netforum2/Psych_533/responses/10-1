===message:This person has done a fine job of summerizing the information in the readings.  Not only that, but has been able to apply it to his/her teaching situation.  The example given showed very well how the schemas interconnect.  The teaching being done is very creative with much thought given to the enjoyment of the students as well as their cognitive growth.
