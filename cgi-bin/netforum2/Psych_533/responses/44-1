<p>
I agree with you saying that the teaching of art needs apprenticeship. Art is a skill that is acquired through a long train and self-practice. Therefore, your decision to apply apprenticeship to your teaching unit is basically best. And I like your application of natural classroom dialogues among students. I think this discussion can help them monitor the process of their painting talking aloud. Also, they can be a model to other students each other by showing their own paintings. Though they are not experts, I think each student can get some idea how to improve her/his own painting through peers' painting.
<p>
There are some points I want to make clear on your explanation. First, you said there are three components in apprenticeship. However, I could find three more components: Articulation, Reflection, and Exploration in Pressely book. I think in order to become an independent artist your students need to be through the rest of components of apprenticeship. Maybe, your application of student discussion about their paintings can be a step of reflection, a component of apprenticeship. 
<p>
Second, I want to talk about your demonstration of your painting. You are the model your students should follow. Rather than stopping painting as you described, if you keep painting through class while students are painting their own, your students can get more chance to see what a real artist is doing through whole procedure of painting. 
<p>
Finally, I want to know which grade level you teach for this unit. Because in most of school years after preschool, student development is on stage four: Covert and abbreviated egocentric speech in terms of Vygotsky's theory. On this stage, inner speech plays a critical role for student development. If you use the inner speech of students for reflecting their painting tasks, they can learn more, I think.

===message:Hard to read, but well done. I think if I were apprenticing to a painter, given my negligible talents, I would want long and many opportunities to see my master in action, which seems not very prominent in this scenerio.

===message:IP533 read this individual's assignment 6. I am not sure if the individual typed the assignment directly onto netscape or downloaded from a disk, but it might be helpful to try clicking on the translated text instead of the HTML. It may make for better formatting and easier reading.

===message:It is interesting.  I previously had a difficult time thinking of apprentices for Art students but as you've applied it, it is easier to understand.  So if I were an amature painter, i could still learn a lot from the apprentice by using his/her styles to develop one of my own.  There are many other ways apprentices can help in the field of art.
