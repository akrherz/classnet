===message:Recap:  Domain specific knowledge, in other words, permits those who possess  the domain content knowledge to process it differently and better than those who are considered domain novices.  Those who have expertise in a specific domain of knowledge will then only have to sort a small chunk of information in a task  in which they possess knowledge.  On the other hand, the novice of the domain will have to sort all of the features of the information.  
So... 
Would this be a good theory to use for standardized test that are considered culturally biased?  The validity of the test would be seriously threatened if it is true that one's cultural would possess this knowledge when the other's would not.

Experts are able to concentrate on significant features  rather than peripheral features.  In your classroom, rather than focus on the music of your student, using our expertise as a teacher you're able to focus on the arm and hand positions which would affect the music played.  Your possession of  knowledge relevant to the domain allows you to focus on these postures that are important in playing piano-like instruments.  The students knowledge of the piano is the domain of knowledge in which he works.  The teacher's knowledge is a more important determinant of performance of the task than just his/her general intellect.  Your expertise also allows you to identify reasons, why the student used a certain arm position and can evaluate and interpretation this actions.    Once the student is taught the proper  arm position, the teacher uses knowledge mediation to reinforce these positions by periodically reminding the student of the arm position.  

Another important point to mention is that children learned more from the text pertaining to their knowledge-rich domains.  An example would be of that child who's parents are educators, e.g. linguists would do excel in English (grammar) in school if he has grown in an environment where linguistics is a part of his upbringing.

===message:WITH RESPECT TO DOMAIN SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE, YOU SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE HELPS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW KNOWLEDGE.  IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE WITH MUCH KNOWLEDGE IN A DOMAIN WOULD DO BETTER ON MOST TASKS IN THAT DOMAIN THAN PEOPLE WITH LESS KNOWLEDGE.  WHAT IS INTERESTING AND NON-OBVIOUS IS THAT NEW LEARNING IS ENHANCED?   WITH RESPECT TO EXPERT KNOWLEGE, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU SHOULD ARTICULATE A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY HOW EXPERTS DIFFER FROM NOVICES.  JUST WHAT DO EXPERTS DO BETTER.  ON THE NEXT POINT, NO ALL EXPERTS ARE PRODIGIES.  ONE IMPLICATION OF THIS POINT IS THAT WE CAN’T MAKE PEOPLE EXPERTS IN A SHORT TERM LEARNING SITUATION.  IT CHANGES OUR GOALS SOMEWHAT.  THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF AUTOMATIZATION OR MODULARIZATION.  (THERE ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THEORETICAL MEANINGS IN EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY FOR THOSE TERMS, BUT THEY HAVE SIMILAR EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS.  ).  WITH RESPECT TO YOUR EDUCATIONAL EXAMPLE, I AM NOT SURE HOW THIS EXAMPLE RELATES TO THE IDEAS YOU DISCUSS.  IT SEEMS TO BE AN EXAMPLE OF FEEDBACK (VERY IMPORTANT!), BUT HOW DOES IT RELATE TO USE OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE.

===message: Critique by Cp533 for Assignment 3 done by Rp533
<br>
I feel that Rp 533 chose important topics from the assigned readings and gave correct definitions/explanations.  I only wish that the explanations could have been given more thoroughly.  They were very brief and to the point and did not give much detail about the concepts.
<br>
I think that the application given for the concepts was good, but it did not state how the application applied to these concepts.  I had to interpret how I thought the two related. I understand that Rp533 is probably trying to relate domain specific knowledge to the idea of teaching someone who already knows how to play the piano to play the piano accordion.  I am not sure if this person could or should be considered an expert thus causing them to have expert knowledge in the area of piano playing.  It could be that the person becomes an expert at playing the piano accordion, after instruction and many hours of practice.  As far as knowledge mediation, I see this coming through when the instructor corrects the arm and hand position that the musician used while playing the piano.  These are just my assumptions.  I am not sure if I have accurately stated what Rp533 actually meant.  This is why it would have been nice to have a discussion about how the application related to the concepts.
<br>
It is hard for me to say what I think could be improved about the application of the ideas because I am not sure if I have accurately assessed what Rp533 was trying to accomplish in relation to the given concepts.  If trying to convey a point about expert thinking, I feel that I should have been given some indication that the piano player was an 3expert2 in this particular field.  How long has he been playing?  Has he received any notoriety in the field?  
<br>
The application of domain specific knowledge was good in the sense that knowledge from playing the piano was transferred to playing the piano accordion which would hopefully allow the person to play better than someone who has no knowledge of playing the piano.
<br>
As far as extending the concepts to new applications, this would be easy.  All of the concepts could be related to any given field such as sports, drama, particular professions, etc.  As a person stays at the given task for a long period of time they become 3experts2 at what they do.  In the process, they develop domain specific knowledge that others who have not repeatedly done the task would not have.  They start to think about these tasks differently from the rest of us probably due to automation which links to expert thinking. It is important that when moving from one area to another in any given domain, that we reevaluate our thinking to accommodate for any differences that we might incur because wrong knowledge impedes learning.
