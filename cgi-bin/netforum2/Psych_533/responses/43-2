===message:I would like to add some information to that presented here.  In an apprenticship I percieve one of the most critical aspects to be the real world application.  The task is in relation to a situation, and when applied influences the environment or situation in some way.

I do not see reciprocal teaching in the way it was presented here.  My impression was that of a peer teaching situation in which the teacher would present the "problem" or discussion topic and students would discuss, learning from each other in the process.  I agree that quick removal of teacher scaffolding would be a part of the senario.  The teacher would not be in charge of the discussion, the students would be trained in the "process" and scaffolding would hopefully be removed much more quickly than would occur in other types of instruction such as direct instruction.

I see the major difference between direct explaination and direct instruction to be on the focus of the outcome.  In direct explaination, the focus is on the process of learning or the new skill.  In direct instruction, the product of the student is the focus.  As a former art teacher, I was more interested in the process, and the learning that was taking place in the possibilities of experimentation with that process.

Your explanation of each idea is brief and concise. However, it is not clear what computer skill you are teaching in this unit. I want to know more specific procedures how you apply apprenticeship to this teaching unit. Though I have some points to make clear, your application is creative and reliable for applying your selected ideas. Good job.

===message:Good job choosing and explaining the key concepts of the chapter.  I would expand on the explanation of reciprocal teaching.  Reciprocal teaching does involve the progressive removal of support of scaffolding, but I think the actual structure of reciprocal teaching is what sets it apart from the other instructional methods presented in the chapter.  Reciprocal teaching involves initial instruction by the teacher in learning strategies (most often reading comprehension strategies).  Initial instruction is then followed by the student-led groups that use the strategies to generate their own questions and summarize and interpret the content of the lesson.  During this stage is when we see the gradual removal of teacher support that you described.  Your application was well though out and demonstrated your understanding of the concepts.  In the application of the concept of apprenticeships, I think that you emphasized modeling heavily.  This seems to fit more with social learning theory than apprenticeships, which I consider more of a one-on-one instructional relationship.  The apprentice does not only pick up on the skills the mentor models, but also through interaction with the mentor, gains more knowledge about the trade to be learned and the culture that surrounds or governs that trade.  Good job on the assignment.

===message:I have a little trouble with "assessing the proximal development" of a student. I understand trying to assess where the zone of proximal development lies, but not the development itself. That's confusing to me.

===message:The individual who posted this assignment demonstrated a good understanding and an acurate conception of the ideas presented in Chapter 8 of the Pressly text, in their "important ideas" section. The explanations given for each of the concepts presented were both clear and concise. The only critique I would offer in respect to this section would be that the individual could have explained a little more in depth the concept of Direct Instruction, and how it differs from the concept of Direct Explanation.
<p>
I have a few comments in relation to clarifying the application section. In section 6a, it may be helpful to clarify the concept of proximal development as it relates to the application. In what way did this task demonstrate proximal development? If proximal development is defined as "behaviors beyond a child's level of autonomous functioning, but within reach with assistance" how is your task assessing the student's level of functioning with assistance- what sort of assistance do you provide as you are measuring this?
<p>
In section 6d, it could be useful to explain which part of the application is direct explanation and which part is direct instruction. Have you included both concepts, or are you only applying one of the ideas presented in section 5d?

<br>
In general, these applications are on the right track. I belive you have obtained a good foundational understanding of the subject matter, yet your applications are a bit brief and lack the depth necessary to convey to the rest of us (or at least to myself) the level of understanding you have achieved. I think that you understand completely what you are discussing in these applications, but since I lack your prior knowledge and experience, I cannot read as much into the applications as you can.

===message:the idea of apprenticeship and reciprical teaching is that the learner is trying to do some expert task, but that she orhe hasn't learned the skills well enought yet.  

so I think some sense of doing a real task should be added to this eaxample.

===message:Yes, I think you are correct about apprenticeship.  However, while it is a one-to-one sort of process, it is more than simply "following Joe around."  I like the social context you describe this process functioning in.  Thanks for the thought.
