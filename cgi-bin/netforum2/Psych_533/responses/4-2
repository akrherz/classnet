===message:Overall, this was an excellent explanation and application of many of the most important concepts from the first reading.  The writer demonstrated a firm understanding of the concepts and applied them creatively.  However, I believe that there were aspects of two of the applications which could be clarified.  First, when applying the concept of proceduralization, I think the writer may underestimate the amount of time and the number of trials that it takes to proceduralize knowledge.  The writer speaks of students being able to automatically use the mapping strategy after only a few attempts.  This may be unrealistic.  In many studies of automaticity, it takes hundreds or thousands of trials to automatize even simple tasks.  Thus, it is unlikely that students' use of the mapping strategy would be fully automatic.  It may be the case that students would use the strategy relatively more automatically than they did before, but the strategy would not be fully automatic.  I do think that the writer meant automaticity as a relative term, but it is important to remember that relative automaticity and full automaticity are different.  Finally, I am not convinced that the writer's technique for getting students to maintain and generalize the mapping strategy is the most effective.  Beyond a discussion of why the strategy is superior to others, I think it would be beneficial for students to attempt to write two papers--once using the mapping strategy and once not using the strategy--and then have each student compare the quality of their own work under the two strategies.  I think that the discussion joined with an experience in which they are able to see how their own work improves under the new strategy would help insure that the new strategy is maintained and generalized to different situations.  Again, other than these two comments, I believe the writer did a great job on this assignment.
