===message:You did an excellent job of explaining the concepts you chose.  I do think that your explanation of scaffolding did not touch on the dynamic nature of scaffolding and the importance of student-adult interactions in the learning process.  Not only is the child developing and learning through external modeling and explanation, their thought processes are developing through "continuous, mutually responsive interactions" with the teacher.  Your applications for each of the concepts was well thought out.  While I do not know anything about Turing machines, I did understand your application of the concepts.  Connecting guide discovery and discovery teaching to metacognitive awareness of strategy use through having students "formalize" their own rules, was good linking of several important concepts in the chapter.  The scaffolding application did more closely address the interactive nature of scaffolding in having the students work on their own and having the instructor provide just enough help to get them through their difficulties.  All in all, you did a great job.  Your explanation of concepts and their application to the classroom demonstrate your understanding of the material.  Good Job!

===message:You did an excellent job of integrating the topics you discussed into your lesson.  Your approach for explaining the rather complicated operations of the Turing machine is good.  It includes the important elements of modeling, observational learning, scaffolding, and guided discovery.  Another important aspect of this lesson is the use of metacognitive learning.  Asking the students to think about how they're thinking as they solve these tasks is an important aspect of allowing them to make this knowledge their own.
Your lesson is creative, interactive and touches on some very important and effective cognitive strategies.
