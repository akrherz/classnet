===message:You explained the various ideas from the readings well and also implemented them appropriately in your instructional exmaple.
<p>
In your example a. of the real-life instructional situation, I would like to suggest that you begin by asking students how they approach problem-solving. Many students have good ideas about what approach to take to solve problems. Once they have clearly articulated their approach and/or ideas, then it would be appropriate to introduce Polya1s general strategies for problem-solving. Such an approach would not only give students the opportunity to consider their own strategies, but also to compare them with those of an expert.

Nice job.
