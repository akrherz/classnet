===message:I like the way that you illustrate the use of several strategies in your application example.  The use of volunteers (who happen to be experts in the field) is an excellent way of making the information, skills and concepts more "real world" to the students.  They see the actual real life application and the need in the business world for the skills being addressed.  This helps not only give another viewpoint from outside of the class, but also allows students to become professionally and personally motivated to attend to the learning process.

===message:Nothing seems to get students attention like a guest speaker from the field in which they plan to work. I think having the speaker return for a second session is a great idea. It gives students time to mull over what they took in the first time around.

As for the peer testing, I didn't see anything about your monitoring the questions they came up with (it wasn't clear to me if you would actually use them on the test). There is always the issue with this kind of work whether one person gets cheated because he/she gets stuck with a lousy partner. So I would suggest monitoring the question-making process so that each group receives rich opportunities to investigate the material.

===message:Good job of applying the information in the text.  I especially liked leaving out some information to get clarifying questions.  That really makes the students think.  It's good that you have a backup plan in case they don't ask questions.  It's good to have volunteers come in.  It gives a taste of the real world and makes the students feel important that someone will come on their own time top help them.
