===message:You gave a very thorough description of each of the ideas you pulled from a variety of readings. The application of your ideas seem appropriate in your lesson. I particularly like how you have the ideas not only reflect in student group activities, but also in student presentations. In your example of using an advanced organizer, you first describe it. Next you have students use it in groups, then through the use of handouts for their presentations. I am wondering if you would have students discuss this use of the advanced organizer strategy during the presentations. I think this would help to reinforce the strategy and also to get feedback about its effectiveness. 
<p>
I also liked your use of "why" questions. Encouraging students to ask "why" empowers and prepares them for the many realistic situations in life that don't provide all the answers. I also agree with you that it promotes the recall of previous knowledge and experiences. I wonder, though, if it would be helpful in this lesson to have students think about and discuss what kinds of previous knowledge they have about the regions before opening the books and other documents. I suggest this simply to address pre-existing ideas conceptions about the material. Once students look at written materials, I think they have a tendency to accept them and replace previous knowledge/misconceptions with the new "correct" knowledge without thinking about the issues. If students can become aware of their previous conceptions before starting the lesson, the "why" questions become a more natural part of the process.
<p>
I would like to conclude by stating that you did a nice job of summarizing the ideas and of applying them to this real-life learning situation.
