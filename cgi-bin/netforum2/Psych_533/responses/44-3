===message:For conversational english:  
For adult students learning english as a second language, when shown an advance organizer such as photos, keep in mind that the process of translating is first done in their native tongue to get the meaning, then schema of what they know in their language and now english. Only then can they really understand in depth the meaning of the passage given.  The attention will be focused mainly on the process of translation from one language to the next and so showing photographs as advanced organizers will not necessarily help them gain a more depth understanding, but will allow them to associate the picture with the words they here.

===message:You apply Pressley's ideas to an interesting learning situation. The learning situation is so unique because it encompasses a wide variety of learners at various language ability levels and from distinct educational backgrounds. I think this might be an appropriate lesson at various intervals throughout the learning process, but I would hope that the learnings would be intertwined with more complex lessons.

So often in language acquisition courses, the students listen to a passage then either repeat it or try to make sense out of it. I am curious to know whether the students are tested orally or using written responses.

Lastly, this type of lesson would seem most appropriate outside of class in a learning lab where students can listen to the tape over and over again and spend time recognizing the sounds at their own pace. This would free up some class time for the teacher to promote more higher order thinking skills.

===message:When I read the chapter in Pressley, I interpreted the idea of an advanced organizer much as the person who wrote this paper.  I relied on my prior knowledge of what I thought an andvanced organizer was, and read the new information from that viewpoint.  In our discussion in class with Dr. Andre, my concept of an advanced organizer changed.  I see that, as Andre presented, Ansubul's original idea of an advanced organizer was more as information that would demonstrate the type of concept heirarchy, or way of thinking about a concept, rather than the actual content.  The way that you have presented an advanced organizer is as a pictorial illustration of the same content as the listening passage.  You are teaching the same thing, in two different forms rather than using Ansubel's idea of an advanced organizer.
	
I think the idea of listening to the tapes and comprehension exercises.  I think that as an outside of class project this would be very effective (homework).  An in class project might be the discussion between students in small groups about a particular topic.  Maybe you could have the listening activity in class with small groups discussing their comprehension of the piece, to facilitate more conversation.  Good job.
