===message:You did a good job summarizing the characteristics of good writers and the processes they go through.  I think your application combining writing and art is powerful.  Both are forms of self-expression, and both mediums require very similar complicated thought processes when it comes to clear communication.  Nicely done!

===message:I liked your commentary on the writing theories. I found it especially interesting that you came down hard on Rohman's model, claiming it was too linear - not the way people write - and then used as an example the combination of writing and painting. I would have to say that I agree with your assessment of Rohman's theory, but certainly writing is a much more linear process than painting. One must follow a line of thought to compose a good piece of writing. I'm not sure such linear thinking is necessary or desirable in painting. 
<p>
Still, you make a very good point, and it seems to me that writing and painting not only share some common elements but also complement each other as well.

===message:While I am certain many people create writing and artwork the way you suggest, I can think of many I know who go through a more formal comprehensive process.  Perhaps if the students created art in one medium they might learn to write by transferring the skills and preparations to writing, imagimg but with words.  perhaps they might paint a scene and then write a scene to catch the parallels.

I would have found this more helpful if you had mentioned what part of your application activity cooresponded with which idea.  I believe, however you are on the right track.  Art is such fertile ground to raise these issues in as many students would not have the needed feelings of self-efficacy in a traditional writing course.  It may be that the course you suggest is a means of addressing this motivational pronlem.

<p>
There are some comments for your writing.
<p>
First, I agree your comment that the process of painting is similar to the one of writing. Psychologists say that all the human tasks; especially higher order tasks are problem solving procedures that make us undergo the several processes to reach the goal. 
<p>
Second, I think it is a good idea that you combine the painting section and writing activity. The writing may help students think back to their painting processes in terms of evaluating their painting tasks and self-suggesting some tips for the future writing. You mentioned you would have them write why they used the techniques they did. This is a kind of monitoring that helps tracking the processes of the painting tasks. Nice method!
<p>
Third, I have one concern that these two tasks, writing and painting are so high-level cognitive tasks, so that I am afraid if the combination of two tasks really works for more deep understanding of the process of each. When students compare two things as you designed, they might be confused. I think at this point the role of a teacher is to lead them step by step to understand the processes.
<p>
Finally, I want to say about the explanation section. You picked up the good points. However, each idea needs more detail explanation. Also I don't see how exactly each idea is applied to your teaching unit. I can see just the overall picture. 
<p>
Generally, you have a creative teaching unit that shows your deep understanding of the context and your effective application to your teaching. Well done.

===message:I have several comments to make in regard to this individual's assignment 12. First, I would like to commend the individual for taking material from both the Pressley text and the assigned readings for the week. Although it appeared obvious that the individual did take the concepts presented from these various sources, it would have been helpful to have cited the specific source for each of the concepts presented simply for the purpose of providing the reader with a reference to look back on if a concept was not fully understood or possibly misinterpreted. The concepts presented seemed to be main points given in both the journal articles and the text, but it was difficult to follow exactly which concepts were being presented. It would have been extremely helpful, from my standpoint, to have the main concepts presented and explained separately. In the format in which it was given, the concepts seemed to all run together and I was not sure which ones were being presented as distinct ideas and which were subcomponents of the main concepts.
I really enjoyed this individual's analogy of these concepts to a work of art. It was a very applicable example and helped me to sharpen my understanding of the material presented. Again however, I would make a comment that the application did not seem to encompase all of the concepts presented in the main idea section, but I am not sure if that is because the individual left some of the main ideas out or if the individual covered the main ideas but did not apply the subcomponents. The use of a little more structure would have been helpful on this assignment.

===message:The parallel between writing and art is interesting.  There are some differences, visual or performance arts that are non-language based don't seem to have as detailed communicative messages as writing.  The message seems more diffuse and often more emotional.  I wonder if that changes the process.  Also some artists at least express the idea that the audience is unimportant.  They create to express something and whether others capture that expressed something isn't very relevant.  The point of the art may be to lead to recipient to create a reaction that may not be the same as the artists.  But in writing, at least much writing, the goal is to create in the reader a reaction that is similar to that in the creator.  I wonder if this changes the process somewhat.  What would a Hayes/Flower type model of painting look like?

This example was provocative anyway.
