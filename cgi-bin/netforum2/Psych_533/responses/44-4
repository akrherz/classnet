===message:The author of this assignment did a very fine job of explaining the concepts he/she chose from the material presented in the assigned Pressley chapter. The explanations were clear, consise, and benificial to my understanding of these constructs. As I moved on to the applications section of this individual's assignment, I immediately decided that this was the one I wanted to critique. I found DP533's applications to be incredibly well thought out and very helpful in providing a much deeper level of processing of these concepts (at least for myself)! I felt that the keyword mnemonic example was right on target and very well done. The keyword mnemonics DP533 came up with for RAM and ROM were very applicable to thier actual functions and therefore could be easily associated and later retreived from memory.
The application for automaticity was by far the most helpful to me. I thought it was an excellent example. When reading the chapter, I understood the concept of enactment and its usefullness in learning, but did not think that it could be applied to any aspect of a curriculum to be taught; that instead it had limitations in its application (maybe it still does). I would not have thought to have students act out computer functions. However, this application sounds both workable and useful in learning this information. Thank you for opening my eyes a little bit wider.
The one critique I would offer involves the application of automaticity. I was not quite sure what purpose automatizing the functions computer components was serving. I would posit that the point was to ingrain in the students the functions of each component. Yet, the students will not actually (except in this excercise) be performing any of these functions so I am lost as to what function automatizing these processes will serve since the computer will always be performing them. 
Even with this criticism, I would like to commend DP533 for doing such a wonderful job with this assignment- keep up the good work!

===message:I very much like the enactment portion of this assignment.  I picture students moving around the room carrying bits (or is it bytes) of paper passing to students enacting adifferent component of the CPU.  This is great stuff!  


I would suggest cartoons rather than just word associations.  perhaps something on the order of the cartoons we viewed in class about the Zimmerman Telegram (Swimmer Man Mexico etc.)

Notetaking is not just the writing of words only.  Many student notebooks are filled with pictoral associations for words (sometimes, however a doodle is a doodle) and concept maps with a profusion of arrows to denote a particular relation.

Automatizing we see in everyday life.  Phone numbers, driving a car (while eating, or sleeping!).  This comes from familiarity with a task through practice.

Good job!

===message:I think that you did an excellent job on assignment 7 and it really shows your understanding.  Your definitions and explanations of the key concepts are well written, concise and easily understood.  Your application impressed me the most.  It demonstrates your level of understanding and creativity in applying the concepts learned to the real-world teaching setting.  In particular, your examples for keyword mmnemonics were great.  I liked how you did not just have students taking notes, but you described a structure or style of organization that would be used by the students.  Additionally, you planned in time for them to review the word associations and study the notes.  The most creative part of your application is the use of enactment in  helping students understand the inner workings of the computer.  Having students physically act out the different component parts and their functions is a great idea.  It is unique in the fact that you are taking a subject that is traditionally presented as factual knowledge and putting the learner into the process.  They become part of the procedure and encode the knowledge of the parts and their functions from different perspective.  The repeated practice and opportunity to switch roles strengthens the application.  Good job!  I can't think of a weakness or criticism of your assignment.
