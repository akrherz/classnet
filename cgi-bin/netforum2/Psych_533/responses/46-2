===message:I thought this was a very good example of creating cognitive dissonnnace and presenting a plausible alternative concept.  Using the activities to let them discover the new concept makes it much more meaningful to the learner.  Are spiders really not insects???  Just kidding!

===message:First, I would like to compliment you on your thorough dicsussion of misconceptions and conceptual change. Your description of these two key concepts took on a different format than required by the assignment, but you seem to understand the the conditions that go into the promotion of conceptual change.  It may have been better to include a definition of the term "conceptual change" before providing the conditions.  You do a nice job applying each of the stages or conditions of conceptual change in the application.  I do have some problems with the activities selected for making students more comfortable with the terminology.  I think that the use of lay language in the definitions would be very helpful in increasing the students' understanding of the new terms by connecting it to prior knowledge and more easily understood langauge.  What I question is the usefulness of crossword puzzles and word searches in helping students understand scientific terminology.  These activities really do not require the child to process new information (the terminology) at a deeper level.  Instead, the students focus on the superficial characteristics of the word as they search for the letters of the word in a word search or look for a word with a particular number of letters in the crossword puzzle.  The are not required to consider what the term means and so they may not comprehend and integrate these new terms into their prior knowledge of insects and spiders, to bring about conceptual change or understanding.  They will be able to identify the words in the text, but I have doubts that they will have a strong understanding of what these terms mean.

===message:The individual who posted this particular assignment 9 noted many of the important concepts from the text and the readings. However, it would have been very helpful if the individual would have noted the source, or sources, of each idea so that I, as a member of the class critiquing this assignment, could go back to the sources the individual noted if I needed clarification on a concept or felt that it had inadequately or inaccurately been expained or applied. 
Another suggestion I would make would be for the author to give a short summary of each of the main concepts s/he noted, even though these were fairly rudementary and straightforward. It would make clear to me that the individual has come away from the material will a solid grasp of what s/he has read if these concepts are clearly defined/ summarized. For example, how do you interpret "initially plausible" and "fruitful" (when speaking about the new conceptions)? I thought that the application used was a very creative and applicable one. The example of the misconception held by students that spiders are insects seems to be a common one (and one that I myself held). It fit very nicely with the material the individual presented from the text and the readings.

<p>
I like your application example. As we learned in class, children in science class usually have a variety of misconceptions internalized by themselves. Your example of spider thing is a good example of needing to be reconceptualized through instruction. 
<p>
Especially, I like your method to let students have a group discussion in order to get the conclusion that spiders are not insects. Through the discussion, they can more activate their cognition to change their misconception, so that they can accommodate new concept into their schema more effectively and more firmly. Also social interaction with peers would ensure them their new concepts about spiders are safe and valuable enough to perceive as a new learning.
<p>
Also I agree with your method to have students dissect spiders to generate evidence of new concept about spiders. This experience will make firm to establish new concepts about spiders through concrete investigation.
<p>
The one thing I want to clarify in your application is that when you will provide them with crossword puzzles, and what terms are exactly presented in the puzzle. In my knowledge, if students are not familiar with terms you try to put in the puzzle, it is not a good idea to present this puzzle method before reading the text. And I want to know what the terms are related to. Is it related to parts of spiders or others? How about use this puzzle method as a follow-up activity after learning this teaching unit? If so, I think they can generate more firm understanding for spiders and related scientific terms. However, this is just my idea, which may not fit your teaching intention.
<p>
With no hesitance, I think your overall teaching unit description and explanation of main points are good and valuable for my thinking about science education. Good Job.

===message:There is much to praise in this lesson - the attention to vocabulary in context with the actual parts of the spider would be a big help, I suspect. I also think there is some merit to the word puzzles just for the opportunity to use terms repeatedly that otherwise would never be said outside of class. Even though they are not attached to any meaning, as another reviewer said, I think there is some value to just seeing a difficult, unfamiliar term over and over again for awhile. I agree with that reviewer though that as much as possible the terms should be used in a meaningful context.
<p>
The major concern I have with this lesson has to do with the relationship of the students to the spiders themselves. Did you realize that nowhere in this lesson do the students encounter a live spider? I once heard someone say that science is the study of things that were once alive. In otherwords, in science we favor cutting things up as a means of studying them to observation of them as living beasts. I think it is important that we not convey this attitude toward living beings at too early an age. At fifth grade I would hope that students would still be fascinated and able to learn a great deal about spiders by watching them move about. They may have a more difficult time learning body parts, but they would certainly learn a great deal more about their behavior and perhaps develop an appreciation for  their place in the ecosystem besides. Unfortunately, the style of scientific investigation portrayed in our book does not much emphasize this way of doing science. It is regretable.

===message:I did have one suggestion with regard to the crossword/word search idea. Perhaps the way to proceed would be for the students to design their own word games based on the material they read and paraphrased about insects.  While not as fun, it might be of more value.  Students could then critique eachothers work for errors in understanding and the class as a whole could collectively build a puzzle for the next year's class.

Read it.  Like the ideas about starting with the characteristics of insects to change misconception of Spiders classification as insects.
