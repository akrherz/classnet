===message:Your selection of key concepts and their explanations were easy to understand and well done. In particular, under knowledge-base activation strategies (5d), you include a good example of a possible intervention that a teacher could perform in making students aware of their incorrect knowledge and the need to change that misconception. This was a good example of teaching metacognitive awareness and skills.  In applying the concepts to an educational setting, I commend you on choosing an example that was different from the ordinary classroom setting.  While this was a unique choice and you did a fine job applying the concepts, I think that there were a few areas in which more elaboration could have been useful to show a deeper understanding of the concepts. Regarding think alouds, I think that it maybe more helpful to provide students with a task or problem that they could solve using technology and have them verbalize the steps, strategies, and processes that they would go through in forming a solution.  I think that Pressley and researchers who use think alouds in their studies use them to gain a better understanding of not only the knowledge that the individual brings to the task, but also how the individual applies their knowledge to learning situations and the strategies used.  While listening to discussion may serve the same purpose, having the students address a particular scenario or perform a task may be more helpful in eliciting this information.  Addtionally, it would be helpful if you had expanded on the role of previous knowledge or knowledge-based activation strategies in this parent workshop.  I don't know if you fully applied this concept and how previous knowledge may both facilitate and inhibit the learning of parents in the workshop.  Finally, your idea of chunking basic information to be learned into categories is a good and manageable way to present information.  I wonder though if activities in which the student had to organize the new concepts and information they were being instructed on would be more beneficial.  While some sort of organization is necessary on the part of the instructor, activities in which students must organize and represent information can be helpful in facilitating the learning of new information.  Overall, you did a good job and I enjoyed reading your assignment.

===message:In your example, you nicely summarize and describe the important topics you selected.  Your example is ok, but it isn’t clear how you use self-regulated learning or think alouds.  Also rather that you doing the clustering, it might be more effective for you to provide a clustering structure and let students cluster ideas into it.

===message:I think the presentation in 5c of think alouds was very good.  The idea to have students discuss the "new" topic and the teacher circulate is excellent.  If I were to modify this, I would have the teacher introduce, at least briefly, so those with little or no knowlege base can contribute.  I would also give the group a task, question or problem to solve cooperatively, with each person having a part in the recording, reporting, etc.
	     In the application of #6 I would suggest a way to relate computer (Macintosh) information in a way that those with no comp. knowlege can still relate.  For instance, I use metaphors.  The desktop is the top of their desk at work or home. On it is a filing cabinet (the hard drive).  Inside the hard drive is stored various kinds of materials, documents (papers), folders, and applications.  I relate this by showing a real folder, with folders inside of it, and papers as well.  This makes an abstract concept more concrete for new learners.  Relating to their lives and concrete objects lessens the fear of the unknown as they begin to feel that they can relate to the new information.
