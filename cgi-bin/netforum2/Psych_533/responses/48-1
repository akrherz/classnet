Response to KP 533
<br>
	KP 533 did an excellent job defining and explaining the concepts.  This assignment went beyond just giving a paraphrased DEFINITIONS from the text.  KP also gave ideas about why such concepts are crucial.
	The application of the concepts was impressive.  It was good to read about a real life scenario of putting these concepts into practice.  I think that KP 533 did a nice job of sorting out which part of the instruction met the goals and objectives of the particular concepts.  
	One thing that I did notice about the application was the use of workbooks and a card game.  These are wonderful tools but I also hope that students have the opportunity to practice reading things in their everyday environment like signs, etc.  
	It would not be difficult to extend the application of the ideas presented by KP 533.   In fact, they should be a part of all reading instruction.  Students become 'good' readers by being presented with various strategies that will enhance this ability.  Children are not born knowing how to read.  It is important that educators deliver instruction to foster the reading experience.
