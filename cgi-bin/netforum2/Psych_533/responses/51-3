===message:Your explanations of the ideas you site from Pressley are concise and clear.  The four ideas are all similar in that they all describe different angles of how people either adapt new information to previous knowledge or vice versa.  Your examples in the applications section helped me to distinguish between the four defininitions. In doing so, I went through a brief process of perceptual learning.  In your example, you described a situation where you were helping young people become aware of the negative affects of alcohol abuse. This information added to their perceptions about how alchohol had benefitted them.  The four ideas that you described could be applied to any situation where people are encouraged to replace misconceptions with new information.  You did a nice job of siting real-life examples using the terms.

===message:Yes, Ip533 has suggested a wonderful application (horse example) of the idea of disequilibration.  Nice Job.

===message:I think you have raised a very interesting issue here; I’d like to know more about *how* you went about the drug abuse education, for mere mental awareness of the problems drugs cause rarely has shown much effect on getting abusers to quit abusing - at least that was the conventional wisdom a long time ago when I was involved working with a rehab program (maybe it’s different now). Even those who clearly understood the effects of the drugs, for the most part, either couldn’t or wouldn’t change their behavior based on that knowledge. Of course, some of this had to do with addiction and emotional disorders (which, no doubt have their own cognitive effects). But it also made me very aware that people seem to be able hold two conflicting ideas in their minds at the same time (even believe them both) without it causing a disequilibrium that resolves the conflict. In fact, it seems to me that all of us do this - or at least very few of us can itemize our most stable beliefs without running into pretty obvious (at least to others) inconsistencies. It seems to go with the human condition - in fact, it often serves as a great asset. Does contradictory information necessarily cause disequilibration? I have my doubts that it always does, especially when the earlier “information” is very powerfully experience/emotion-based while the other is essentially abstract/rational. This even leads me to wonder if it is justifiable to classify an abusive attitude toward drugs as ‘information’ at all.
<p>
On the other hand, I loved the portion of your work that involved teaching children horseback riding. I wonder if such very rich physical experiences with living, lively animals might cause more helpful cognitive conflict than all the information any of us could impart to them on the ill effects of drugs?
<p>
In any case, your report is a fascinating application of Piagetian theory. I wonder if anyone has ever devised a test of how well his theory actually works with drug-affected children?

===message:
Simple and precise explanations. Your application is well organized. The only thing I want to ask is if those children are already addicted by drugs and alcohol. Becuase I think your teaching units are more powerful for students who don't have those experience but have a chance to. However, You did a nice job.

===message:I like the application of the terms presented. The example of the horses was especially clarifying.  We see this over a period of time.... being able to distinguish individual characteristics in what at first seemed just a large, similar group.
