===message:Your classroom application is very good.  And, it seems, your "seat of the pants" approach to geometry has some solid cognitive psychology interventions at work!  I like the way you bring students into the lesson by getting them physically involved in understanding math -- it sounds like a good educational experience to me!

===message:While I enjoyed your application for the key concepts you selected, I wish that you had expanded on your explanations of these key concepts.  For Polya's problem solving, the four "steps" you listed are better explained characteristics that are common to all forms of problem solving.  Your discussion of Schoenfeld's monitoring and control provided a nice example of what is involved in the process. Your explanation of cooperative learning seemed a little bit light. It may have been helpful to provide the reasons or advantages that cooperative learning provides students: (1) a focus and value on the learning process, rather than the products of learning, (2)in math instruction, it can reduce math anxiety, (3) provides an opportunity to use more challenging and less conventional problems (as seen in your application to geometry), (4) it fosters explanation and reexplanation between students, helping to bring out misconceptions, and (5) provides students with multiple presentations of problem situations.  Lastly, your explanation of learning from examples should have gone more deeply into the uses of worked examples in math instruction, a focus in the chapter.  Again, I enjoyed your application.  It sounds like a fun learning experience!

===message:Interesting.  I often notice that some of the strategies I use in teaching are used first and then, only later do I learn that they are based on someone's theory.
