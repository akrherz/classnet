===message:In your explanation of higher and lower order thinking questions, you center on the use of questions for evaluation of the student,by the teacher.  Often in class, the teacher uses the question as an impetus for learning.  In order to answer higher order thinking questions the student must think about the information presented, relate it to prior knowledge, organize their thoughts and verbalize their ideas.  This is more of a learning process than merely listening to the teacher talk.

<p>
I agree with your explanations for your chosen four key ideas. Your explanation is very understandable and clear to me. 
<p>
I like your application situation. The teaching unit you created is suitable for applying your four ideas you picked up very well. 
<p>
Especially I like your 5d-application part. In this open learning situation, efficient individual learning looks possible, for each student can pace her or his learning progress, as s/he wants. In a whole class situation, though a teacher leads a class in the only pace, the level of mastery learning is really various as much as the number of students. However, a teacher can¡¯t ensure that every student understands on each moment. On the contrary, this open learning lab makes a teacher handle student progress differently depending on the learning development of each student. It is a good idea for mastery learning. 
<p>
The only thing I concern about this application is how you make assessment for student academic achievement. With your application, at the final of the semester, students have different depth of learning about psychology. Because students should master each unit by passing quizzes with a score of 80%, some students can¡¯t finish your whole agendas in the semester though other students did great job on the same task. Then how you will handle this different achievement is very important. I want hear your opinion about this someday.
<p>
The other thing I like in your application is that your open learning lab situation makes it possible to utilize various questioning activities as you mentioned. Through man-to-man interaction between you and each student, you have more time and opportunity to ask questions identifying student understanding and to answer to student questions. Verbal expression of student understanding through the exchange of questions and answers is a good strategy to enhance depth of processing. 
<p>
Overall, you did good job on this. I could think your application idea for my teaching unit. Your idea is very helpful for me. Good Job.

===message:This "open learning " approach previously was called the "keller plan" or the "personalized system of instruction" (PSI for short).  Research indicates that it can be very effective for the kinds of assessment usually used in college and high school classes.  ONe problem is that many students get behind and drop out unless one "encourages" them to keep up with structure such as "You must complete your first test by the end of week "  Individual differences tend to be reduced because retakes allow the student to reach a high enough achievement level.  However, this claims does not deal well with the idea that students who pass early go on to more learning in other classes.  Elimination of individual differences is impossible.

===message:I very much like the model you present of the open learning environment.  I wonder if some sort of more formal group interactions among students would contribute to the move-at-your-own-pace idea.  Perhaps students of differing abilities could enter into sort of a tutoring relationship.  The role you envisage for the instructer was very interesting also.  Perhaps some lecturing might occur if the instructer notices a common misconception or problem.
<br>
  
<p>
There is also the issue of early and late finishers.  Students who finish early might be passed on but students whose pace extends beyond the semester could be problematic.  Perhaps if there existed some sort of absolute deadline that all components of the course be finished by.
<br>
  
<br>
One of the most powerful ideas you mentioned is the back and forth questioning that can occur between teacher and student.  This error-checking is an absolute necessity for the communication of information or the transmission of learning.  This is an excellent idea that I wish had wider appeal.  
<p>
<br>

However, the reality that business and society at large demand some objective form of ranking or some standard criteria on which to judge a person's ability with respect to another's makes mastery learning problematic in a society where social mobility and credential collecting are more highly valued than simple mastery.
