===message:Outside intevention is good when acts of inhumane takes place. People being starved to death, even gunned down. Unsure if Austialla intevention was just for the people of East Timor or if they had something to gain from this act. However the Timor people gain their independence. I feel as though the UN is not all together when it comes to the matter of world peace. Example is the war in Iraq, What's the deal with France. Do they have thier heads in the sand?

===message:I think that outside intervention is a good thing only when it is necessary. I think that it was necessary in the situation with Timor. The people of East Timor were given the choice to become free. They were not told if you choose to be free you will be gunned down. If they were not going to be freed then why were they even given the choice? If someone had not come in and intervened there might not be any people left in Timor. I think that intervention should stay local unless it is such a big issue that it can not be solved locally. In any event that occurs (including the war with Iraq) the public does not see every issue that has to be dealt with, and I don't think that the UN is doing their job badly, but I also don't think it matters who supervises the intervention, as long as it is done.

===message:I think that outside intervention is a good thing when the inside cannot control things and if they have good intentions of helping. but if they step in only to cause greater problems or for the benifit of themselves then there should be no need. I do not think that the invasion of East Timor was done for the right reasons because if the people knew what the stipulations of being free was some probaly would not have chosen to do so. Why even give they a choice? I feel that intervention should stay local up until thing get outta control then I think that there should be a global intervention but only at that time. I think that Nato and the UN should supervise but only for periodically checkin to see if they are needed and they should not step in until then.

===message:I think intervention is a good thing when there are no other solutions.  I think that before someone gets into something they know nothing about they should make sure everything has been done to try to solve the problem before they try to help.  Sometimes if you rush into something then you make the situation worse than it already is.

inhumane and killed, then someone should step in and help get things back on the right track. I alos think that the UN and NATO should supervise so there can be some checks and balances.

===message:The intervention in East Timor was done for the right reasons.  The people had voted their opinion and it was not allowed to happen.  The intervention saved lives and restored order.  In reviewing the websites you gave us on this subject, I did not feel that this was an invasion by Australia.  I could only open the website by the UN.  And they painted the picture that Australia was there to help restore order not invade.  I feel that an outside country should only step in when the basic rights of a countries people are being trod upon by a tyrant.  The UN should oversee when there is and intervention to make sure that it is not an invasion.

===message:In the case of East Timor,I feel that intervention was necessary.  Too many people were being brutally murdered.  Outside intervention is ncessary in Civil Wars where government employees or an organized group is killing and destroying the property of innocent civillians for no apparent reason. It would be good if the locals/or neigboring countries could help to solve disputes and issues.  But that does not see to happen, and the United States constantly step in and help to resolve conflicts around the world.

===message:It is necessary to try and help when people can't help themselves.  The invasion of East Timor was done with good intentions but at the same time it doesn't make any sense.  Most of the time the UN and NATO try to help but just end up making a nation wide publicity act in the process.

===message:Intervention is a good thing when a country loses control over it's own citizens or militia groups threaten to take over the region. When there are brutal murders and mass killings. Stronger outside assistance is necessary to regain control. The invasion by Australia was done for the right reasons. Had they not stepped in, there would have been more killings, looting, etc. The main reason I agree with Australia invading East Timor is because Indonesia was in the process of becoming an independent nation by using legal voting procedures and the people were being killed for wanted to be free. Whether intervention should be local or global depends on the size of the threat. In this case, it should have been the UN with NATO backing them up with security forces and supervision. This backing has to be ongoing to prevent or discourage any uprisings in the future. There has to be a deterent from violence at all times. That is why we have the United States of America. It makes the bad guys think twice about doing the wrong thing.

===message:Sometimes intervention is the only solution to a problem. Especially when peoples rights or themselves are being abused. Australia intervention with Timor helped free the people from the hell they were living in. Just like we have tried to do in Iraq. Is this right or wrong? In my eyes if you cannot solve the problem by yourself then asking others is the next thing to do. As far as the UN they can't agree on much so why bother with them. If a country ask for help then those who are helping them should oversee the cause and effect of doing so.

===message:In the case of Timor,the intervention by Australia was a good thing. With out them there might not been any people left to live in a independent Timor. I also think it should be for a limited time until the Government and Millitary  are ready to run Timor by themselves. If that process should take to long the supervision of NATO or UN might be wise so Australia does not get in a position of imposing themselves on the Timornese People.

===message:Outside intervention was a good thing in this case, since it stopped the killing quickly, and allowed East Timor to begin considering their separation and to implement the government that was voted into being.  The U. N. does try to assist in keeping the peace, but as we have recently seen, isn't always successful.  Intervention on a global scale would be unmanageable it seems. Keeping the U.N. as a tool of the world, and not only of the members of NATO seems the way to go as far as supervision of intervention.  Unfortuntately, many individual cases will fall out of UN hands before they ever get a chance to attempt to help.

===message:To me it sounds like Australia definately did the right thing. I think that it became a matter of human rights. I think intervention should always be a global thing, and if possible the U.N. should supervise because it is more likely that the intervention will then be for the right reasons and not for selfish reasons. Although unfortunately it seems from recent events, that it is almost impossible to get the U.N. to all agree when intervention is necessary.

===message:I believe that outside intervention can be a good and bad thing. Sometimes people may need that help and because of intervention their situation was resolved and everthing worked out for the best. On the other hand getting involved in somebody's business can cause more trouble than it's worth. I guess it depends on the situation and how getting involved can affect their own lives.

===message:I think intervention in the form of assistance is a good thing when human rights are being violated and people are starving and dying. The problem I have is that often we dress things up to be humanitarian aid when actually we are just jockying for political influence in the area. There is so much suffering in the world....how does one pick whom to help first? My theory is that we help those whom we also have something to gain from.
