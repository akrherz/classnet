===message:From my understanding I the people that own these companies are leaning on the postive side of the pole. I don't think that Americans are getting anything positive about NAFTA. Because if the same items were made here in the United States the prices wouldn't be cheaper at all. The owners of these companies are just getting over off of the labor for these people. It is not right to me. But if they don't fight to change the facts. They will continue to be abused by these companies. The negative is in favor of the Mexicians because when are out there working  everyday for your family to surive and you are still where you started from it should make them angry and want to leave.But if they don't fight to change the laws and the  wages. There side will always be a negative. Nobody is winning but the companies.

===message:I believe that the companies who are relocating to this area are benefiting the most from the Maquiladora Manufacturing. The positive is for these companies and their stock holders, because the profit capabilities for these companies are much greater in Mexico due to cheap labor and laws that are less strict that the U.S. The negative is that the American people are constantly losing jobs when the companies move to Mexico. Another negative is that the Mecian people themselves still struggle to make ends meet and provide food and shelter for their families.

They will work for next to nothing but they work their butts off harder than Americans. I don't think they should work them for cheap just because they are willing. They have families to and they have to live like crapt because of these companies.Everybody should be treated based on their performance, not their race.

===message:Companies that set up maquiladoras benefit the most from it.  The lure of cheaper labor will always increase a companies bottom line.  I believe that the maquiladoras system benefits more than it hurts.  The Mexican people who work at these plants work there by choice.  It helps them provide food and basic necessities for their families.  If they had options that paid more they would be taking them.  A companies job is to create a profit; otherwise why would they stay in business.  If they can create a larger profit by making some changes they always will.  Americans have always wanted to pay the lowest price for any product they buy.  If a new company opened in Mexico and was able to produce the an equivalent computer to the one you were considering buying, would you pay an extra hundred dollars, or more, just because you knew the brand you were buying  pays their help more?  Most of us would not.  We just want to pay the least we can.  

I don't really see many negatives to this system.  I know the unions want us to say it is terrible; it takes jobs away from the americans, but I believe, that another company would figure out how to manufacture the same product cheaper-- that would also takes away american jobs.  We live in a capitalist society, where we are have so much opportunity.  In business, only the profitable can survive.  If there is no profit then there is no company.

===message:Wouldn't it be up to the Mexican Government to levy restrictions on the companies and to ensure that they build adequate housing for their employees? American companies may be making a profit but you can not fault them if they take advantage of the opportunities given them. But you can require them to provide better benefits ( e.g. modular housing).

===message:Who benefits from maquiladoras? What are the positives and the negatives of this system of production?

The beneficiaries of maquiladora manufacturing are us, on one hand, in that we can continue to purchase the goods we've always purchased at lower, or at least the same,  prices because they are being manufactured at lower cost on the border of Mexico and the U. S. by the same manufacturers who have always produced these goods.  Bottom lines are still showing profits on the NYSE, so the rich are staying that way. The caveat is that the employees at the factories are no longer US union workers making agreed wages, and enjoying health benefits.  They are Mexican women making $20.00 a week.  Aren't we lucky.  The trucking industry doesn't mind much.  It hasn't changed their profit margin.  There are still the same quantities of goods to transport over land.  Most likely the lack of lobbying against NAFTA by the Teamsters is one of the reasons it became acceptable to have the free trade zones.  Unions. They're not what they used to be and weren't after their initial positive steps toward humanizing the workplace became selfish, greed motivated activities just like the industries they were trying to revamp. It's beneficial to Mexico to have these factories in one way.  They will have those physical plants to use as bargaining tools to bring in other industry some day.  That is, if not having laws against pollution don't turn all the potential workers' descendants into mutants with horrid medical problems.  

The US is trading off higher cost of purchasing goods we want for fewer jobs for Americans and the possibility of the border between us and Mexico becoming a chemical wasteland that is uninhabitable.  

Like so many other things, it's to keep the cash flow going....for now.  That rarely works in the long run, does it?  Educate me if I see this incorrectly.

===message: The main people that benefit from the maquiladora factories are the owners. They get their product made cheap and then bring it back to the U.S. and sell it for much more. The community really does not benefit because no matter how much it cost the owners to make the product they would still sale it for the same price. The Mexicans that make the products do benefit some from the factories because if they were not there they would not have a job at all. These factories are taking jobs from Americans. If the factories were not allowed to pay such low wages with unliveable conditions then the factories would be built in America. These factories are also ruining the Earth for future generations. They are not regulated and are putting chemicals and stuff in the air that should not be there. All factories put waste in the air, but at least in the U.S. it is regulated. These factories may only be affecting the air in Mexico right now, but eventually all the waste is going to move somewhere else.

===message:I feel personally that a maquiladora should not exist.  If the Mexican population, or any other low-income population wants to work their workers for .35 cents per hour, well that is their perogative.  However, I don't feel that the United States should contribute to that.  If we own the factories and we are employing these workers, well then we should pay them what we pay our own citizens.  (If they are citizens of the United States).  If not, well then I do not believe that we should pay them the same as us because the cost of living in their country is much smaller than here.  However, I do believe that if we have our factories in certain cities, we should do what we can to contribute to helping them get cleaner water, and better living conditions.  Our rats don't even live that bad.

===message:For one, General Motors own some of these plants and proudly closes down plants where workers can invest in the stocks and becomes profitable citizens in our own country.  One positive thing is that it allows the people in Mexico to have gainful employment and they can continue to stay in their home country and celebrate their culture without infringing on the US.  The negative side is that they are putting us, Americans, out of working and creating more social problems for our people than necessary. I think this is totally unfair.  These major corporations that are running from environmental protection laws ought to be stopped.  They want to break the law and kill others in other country just to keep their wallet and stocks to themselves.  I think this is awful. I feel something needs to done to keep these powerful companies who can afford to have plants in Mexico and US from hiding behind cheap labor at the cost of other humans who just want to make a living.

===message:I work for a company that has 3 factories set up in Mexico:  Mexicali, Juarez and Monterrey.  Except for marketing decisions, these companies are pretty much their own entity.  Each facility has their own accountants, engineers, purchasing buyers, etc.  I see the workers in Mexico having the advantage.  Because of the American factories, the people have access to retirement programs, all statutory benefits we enjoy, and women are entitled to maternity just as our women here - and they are guaranteed that their position will be held for them if they wish to return.  I'm sure the pay isn't all that great, but that's because we compare it to our standards.  If there weren't any maquiladoras, illegal immigration would rise beyond anything we could fathom.  Mexicans are already coming in droves looking for employment here.  And they are taken advantage of.  Many do find jobs, but the are paid in cash under the table.  Business owners and employers both know that many of the Mexicans will work for less (and harder) than we do.  Many business owners even go so far as to deceive these workers, paying them even less, tell them that they are taking out taxes and social security.  To a degree, maquiladoras offer security.  They offer a real paycheck will long-term benefits.  I will agree that our corporate industries aren't paying these workers what they should truly be paid, but again, they offer security.

===message: The smaller benefit is that of the workers.  The Workers perform jobs for minimal pay but the benefit is that they have a job and are able to feed their families and buy necessities. The greatest benefit is that of the companies that are employing the workers.  The companies are having their products produced and shipped at a fraction of the cost that the company would have paid someone in a more orgranized economy.  Also, the companies may not have to provide benefits for the maquiladora worker which would save them thousands per employee.

===message:Once again things revert back to the big companies making a lot of money off of the hard working man. Yes, these companies hire these people who work for almost nothing and put in long hours. Who gets rich the company. However if these people would set their standards alittle higher and demand more from these companies than they might see more rewards for working so hard. I guess the positive is the working man makes money to provide for his family and the negative side is work hard for almost nothing. Doesn't sound very tempting.

===message:Having been involved in the trucking end of America I can enlighten you on our companies going to Mexico and elsewhere to make our greedy goods at a lower cost.Since The U.S. has started letting Mexican drivers come into the U.S. and haul freight things have decreased greatly. As the Maquilador's work almost for nothing so do the truck drivers. They have come in to the U.S. bided on freight so low that an American based company cannot counter offer because they would go broke. Again the big companies make all the money and us (truckers of America) go deeper into debit and a lot of us are losing our jobs, trucks, and homes. A course we have enough jobs for everyone (HAHAHA) so lets allow more people to come in and take work (food from our children, a decsent life, and benefits) from us Americans living in our homeland to help the more unfortunate countries. (Take care of your own first!). Oh, don't let the politics fool you about how they are benefiting our country by doing this. They are not the one fighting to make a living and compete with others who have lower standards of living because they seem to be involved with the rich companies who are benefiting from these Mexican workers. One can't blame a Mexican for wanting to work especically if they have a family to feed also.

===message:The owners of the various companies are the only benefactors of using these foreign workers.  They work harder than the normal (average) american because they know what hard work is and feel  that we have it easy.  They also feel as if we take what we have for granted and true, we do.  They are proud of what they have and work harder than most born americans.  I don't see a positive for either side of this, because the employer gets a good, hard worker and pays them less because of no Visa or for the simple fact that they can.  The negatives are more apparent because they (Mexicans) aren't earning what is rightly theirs (minimum wage).

===message:In a small way, the workers benefit temporarily from the maquiladoras. Mostly the big American businesses that they are doing the work for benefit. This trickles down to the consumer because they are able to offer the merchandise at cheaper prices than they would if they were paying a decent wage for the work. The consumers buy the products, putting more money back into the American economy. It is Mexico that suffers because the minimal wages are only a benefit for the fact that they provide a temporary means of survival. In the end it is Mexico that suffers from the negative effects on the people and the envoronment. Also, the Americans that would actually fill the jobs in American factories suffer. It doesn't matter how cheap the products are, you simply aren't buying them if you are standing in the unemployment line.
