===message:I totally agree with that comment about Argentina. Sometimes it is good to have many different opinion and sometimes it's not. Sometimes ,in the case of Argentina, many opinion wasn't a good idea. If they would only agree on something and think of the citizens while doing so things would be better. It would greatly improve their economy and the rate of their living.
