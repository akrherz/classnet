===message:Sometimes we can't see our own hometowns clearly until we have spent time elsewhere. I was not impressed with Columbus growing up. I found it did not offer me what I needed. If you were intersted in reading something that was NOT a bestseller or listened to music that was not Top 40 than there were not a lot of resources here.(If Waldenbooks or Blockbuster did not offer it you were out of luck...two companies that practice self censorship; therefore not a good source for alternative views) I then ended up living in Reno, NV for a couple of years and then Las Vegas for a couple of years. After moving back to Columbus, I saw things differently. It was comforting to live here again because Columbus feels so safe. For the most part people here are very friendly and are straight forward. In places like Vegas, you have a lot of people who are looking to take advantage of you and friendliness can make you a target. Southners really do seem more open and trusting. Nowdays, thanks to the internet, we are not so cut off and there are more things and ideas available to us regardless of our geographical location.

===message:I always thought that Louisville/Clayton AL offered everything I would ever need.  I haven't always lived here in the south, but it's where I formed friendships and it's what I refer to when I talk of "home".  After graduating high school, I joined the military and left this area kicking and screaming.  In close (small) communities, you form close bonds.  You know everyone and they know you and it's good because it's familiar... it's what you know.  I enjoyed all the places I traveled to, but I couldn't wait to come back home.  There's no place like home... or so I thought.  Six years later, I finally came back.  Now, every morning I wake up kicking and screaming at myself... WHY?!?!?!?  Nothing has changed.  I thought that would be good, but instead, I'm let down.  It seems everyone is still living the same slow routine as when I left.  Everyone is still living in the same town, the highschool sweethearts have married each other and have kids of their own.  They are all working the jobs that their parents worked and only a handful made it to/through college.  Don't they care about what's offered outside this town, this county, this state?  There is just so much more out there, but they stay here. The cycle will never end.  They have all settled.  A handful of the teachers are beginning to teach the third generation of these families.  It's just not for me anymore.  This way of life is too slow for me now.  In a town that meant everything to me in my adolescent years now feels distant and unconnected.
