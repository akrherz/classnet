===message:You cannot say that it is all the govt fault because of the election of corrupt govt's officials and new ones need to be elected because when we elect someone we dont know that they are gonna be corrupt to us when they are campaigning they are making so many promises to us to get in office but when thaey do it is a different story and by that time we are stuck with them. so yes I do believe there is corruption but there is much more to this than to elect new officials because we dont know who will be corrupt to us and who will get the job done..................
