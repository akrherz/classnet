The imending war weighs on my mind too! I am concerned because there is a lot of anti-war protest among our allies and I fear that us moving forward with violence not only will create more enemies among our Muslim nations but among our allies as well. Going to war and creating more violence and inevitably harming innocent people is going to create even more negative baggage for this nation.
