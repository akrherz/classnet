===message:I think that one day there might be a United States of Europe.  Europe is so big and well populated right now they could all come together as one or soem of the larger countries become smaller to be called a state.  The large number of immigrants should not bother the way the Scots are looked at.  But I assume they would drown out the complaints about the Scots and Basque.  Europe will probably continue its break down of the countries into states.  The only country I know that I think has some freedom is England but it is on our side of the battle it is just across the ocean.  It almost feels to me like England belongs to the U.S. and is a great part of us.

===message:Time has a way of changing everything.  I do believe that eventually there will be a "United States of Europe".  I think that that would be a good thing.  As long as there is a democratic government, just as there is here.  I feel that Europe, as any country that does not have a democratic governement, has been suffering.  I don't believe that any country should have just one man making the decisions for his or her country and that being the be all and end all to it.  No man or woman is perfect, so the more people there are to speak together,and come together to make a adecision, the more chances there are that the decision will be a correct one.  
As far as the immigrants coming into the country, of course that will continue to happen.  That is the reason why there is breaking off of different countries.. as you said with Yukoslavia.  History always seems to repeat itself..one way or another..

===message:Mr. Byrd,
I hate to admint my ingnorance on the issue of the European Union before this topic came up.  I graduated in 1987 and having four children have not kept up with the changes in Europe.  I enjoyed the EU website, and will try to keep up with the happenings over there.  I think that eventually Europe will unite.  There will be some definate growing pains while they work out governing details.  Each of the countries in Europe is used to being independent and will have to learn better cooperation and how to make decisions for the benefit of every nation not just their own.  I think that Scottland could acheive independence.  However, I think that eventually being in the EU will be the smart choice so even if they are independent of the UK they will be involved in then EU.

===message: I think that Europe has come a far way from what it used to be. If they continue to break down their countries one day they may all unite, but I don't see it happening any time soon. All the different nationalities want to keep their traditions and cultures and until they learn to work with each other instead of against each other they will never unite. They might unite in name, but that will be all. I think that they need to learn to respect each culture and learn to appreciate each other before they can become united, in name and soul.

===message:Why not have a United States of Europe? Here in the United States we have different cultures and nationalities. But thankfully we dont have war against one another. While reading the weeks assignment, I realized how must I didnt know about Europe. The size is unreal, so many different ways of life. It amazed me how differently the women were treated.For Europe to become united, a new way of treating people as a whole must take place. They have to look beyond race,wealth,and the culture one comes from.

Its been like that and unless they see a great need for that much of a drastic change, I dont think it will happen anytime soon.

===message:It seems real for the "United States of Europe" Why wouldnt it? Many other countries are likely to follow in thier footsteps. For example, Scotland recently formed thier own parliament, something that has excited the country dearly. Things changing for the Continent is good. Europe and their immigrant policies should have a common ground. This is nothing but a  movement for something positive.

===message:In my opinion Europe will continue to break down into smaller countries however, they will never become a United States. There are to many conflicts both religious and economical among themselves to allow it to happen. Look at how long the Catholics in Ireland have been fighting their religious war. Europe would also need to learn to live amongest different cultures and societies like we do and somewhat get along with each other. At least the U.S. does do this well enough where we don't have wars amongst our states. (Not talking gang wars). As far as immigrants go they will have to deal with them just as we do and figure out how to support all of them and their selves also.

===message:I do not think that there will be a United States of Europe anytime soon. The politicians in Europe are very indecisive and I don't think that they will ever be able to agree on the conditions of a united europe. I don't believe that the large influx of immigrants would drown the complaints of the scots because these people have an opinion and beliefs that they will not back down from. I think some parts of europe will decide to break apart into smaller countries, while others will decide to unify.

===message:The state of the European Union is a great idea that is a work in progess. I don't believe that it will happen in the next decade simply because most European country see themselve as different from other countries i.e. if your from Germany then you see yourself as German. To be united you most have the same cause. Many of the countries are still trying to establish some type of stable governing body. In the case of the Scotts and the Basque, I feel that immigrants that come into these countries can't affect their cause, it just going to take time. American took over one hundred years to reach "freedom".

===message:I think that it would benefit them to unite, but it is so much easier said than done. I think that these countries are all made up of people who are learning many of there opinions from their parents, and it is impossible to completely erase the opinions of people like those in Scotland. I don't think that immigrants can drown out the voice of those who have been there fighting for this for so long. France and Germany may go further in their plans but there will still be the same types of problems in Europe.

===message:
If assimilation of race, language and religion ever takes place, there could be a United States of Europe.  It seems unlikely in the foreseeable future, however, given the differences in the nations that make up Europe.  Eventually, without support and an influx of immigrants who agree with the Basque, or the Scots in that case, it is likely that their arguments will be forced to disappear, or at least be assuaged by an agreement such as the one between England and Ireland.  Countries breaking down into smaller states is certainly possible, given the vast economic differences between northern and southern Italy, or the differences between the Catalonians and the Basques and the Spanish.  Strong centralized governments who respond to the needs of all the countrymen could keep those revolutions at bay.

===message:Ultimately Europe is evolving into a Union. In this growing global economy and society and high speed communication the barriers will break down. It is a fine line finding that unity while still respecting diversity. Though it can be down. It will be difficult for Europe for awhile as they work through this time of flux. Though what is next...The United States of the World? It's intersting because the workd has to move into a new direction. We've got to move away fron the polluting industrial world view and learn how to exist without causing so much harm to the planet. I think we all need each others help to achieve that.
