===message:The people of Argentina should take some responsibility for whats going on. There are many options they can take to better their lives. But on the other hand they can only do so much. The leaders have more power than the people and without a good leader it is hard to have a good country. It is very sad that they have to encounter these things but if the world would stop fighting long enough to help these countries than there could be a stop to this.

===message:I think it is to easy to say that the people of Argentina should work to improve their situation. We take for granted our relatively stable economy. Imagine food becoming so expensive you no longer can afford it. People will become so desperate that they will begin looting. Economic policy is set by a nations leaders. I think pretty much all leaders trying to obtain power make a lot of promises to better the lives of individuals. However, does not mean those promises will be fullfilled. I am wary to blame the Argentine people for their plight. I could be wrong and hopefully Mr. Byrd can correct me, but does not Argentina have a history of being a oppressive gov't. Did not many young people disappear who disagreed with the rulers? It is easy to say the Argentine people should just work to make their country better....but what if you "disappear" or are killed when you take a stand.
