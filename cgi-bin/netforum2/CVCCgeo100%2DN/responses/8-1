===message: My mom always told me if I did not have anything nice to say not to say anything at all, so I do not think I will be able to join in on this class discussion.(Just playing) I think every country, state, and city in the world is important. Russia is filled with all different types of people. Different types of people are what make the world what it is today. Think about it without different types of people we would not have pizza, hot dogs,or french fries(not that any of these foods came from Russia, but what would you eat everyday without these foods? Russia is also  filled with plenty of useful resources and agricultural zones. Each and every place makes this world what it is and we could survive without them, but it is probably best to keep them around. We think that the people in Iraq are important enough that we are willing to feed the good while we kill the bad. If the innocent citizens of Iraq are important then Russia most be one of the top dogs.

===message:I was some what like Mr. Byrd, as a child I feared what Russia could and would do to the United States. It's nice to know that they  no longer are a threat to the U.S.. To ask if they are important, I guess it is a matter of who you ask. For those in Russia, the answer would be yes. For years and years they were under such a harsh rule. Now that they are free they have more of a sense of relief. However the times are hard for many, less jobs, less money. But to be free from such a harsh rule, sometimes it may be worth the struggle. As for me I think Russia is still important, because they still have much to offer. They still have some great people and ideas. As well as great agriculture land.

===message:Yes, Russia is still important, because the Russian Federation had independent republics, and if they did not have a republic then they would not be that important and I sure that all countries are important in some sought of way. Even if they don't not do things the way we do in the United States.

Like the United States we have people, cultures, religions, and immigrants that come to make up the U.S. and yet Russia has the same except for some of the freedom we have.

===message:Is Russia still important?  Well...unless you consider that their land mass is the largest on earth and their population is close to the size of the entire U.S, and that their natural underground resources are widely unexplored, then no... it wouldn't be important. But... considering those things, and the threat that will continue to exist if their pollution isn't cleaned up, and their nuclear proclivities aren't corralled, then Russia becomes a very important concern.  The situation there is the closest one on earth, it appears in the text, to fostering the next "pioneer spirit" adventures, particularly in the far eastern territories.  It will be very interesting to follow what happens in Russia over the decades to come.

===message:Yes, Russia is still important.  They have a land mass twice the size of the US and much of it is undeveloped. There are great untapped resources there.  The Russian government needs time to develop.  The people of Russia have not gotten used to the idea of being able to voice their opinion yet.  They will need to learn to direct their government to legislate pollution and create a way to control inflation.  

I do consider Russia important, however, I don't consider them to be a world power right now. Not like they were before.  However, they can still be very dangerous.  With their nuclear arsenol, and wide spread corruption, who is keeping a watch on the weapons?  From the readings it doesn't seem like the current government is capable of securing such dangerous items.  I worry that these nuclear items of mass destruction could end up in the wrong hands.

===message:One should not look down or away from our neighbor Russia. Yes they are finally out from harsh leadership and times have changed. However, they still hold a spot in the United Nations and also have fought our enemies and in times like these this information is very valuable. The people of this country are also a benefit to society. Many hard working and knowledgable people come from this country. Who knows they might discover a cure or some vital thing we "Americans" might need. I also feel in time they will overcome their hardships and become a heathy "free" country and benefit the world in their productions of products and political views. Trying hard times makes one truly understand and not abuse what they have now.

Russia is a superpower that could be a thorn in the United States side if we were ever to go to war with this country.  So yes I do think it is extremely important to watch what is going on in Russia and keep up on the daily happenings.
Also, the Russian Gymnasitcs teams are tough competors for the US during the Olympics and other competitions.  We have to train hard, make few or no mistakes in order to win a medal in this event

===message:Is russia still important? With everything that has happen to Russia in the last ten years, going from "super-power" to a nation with many countries that are no many third world countries it has resurfaces as a major player in the war with Iraq. The countries is in routine but the hold a key un vote on the second resolution that may or maynot be voted on. Its also still important because of the nuclear weapons that are divided up among all the rouge generals of those countries from the baltics to the "stand" nation. Russia is still important and over the next few weeks they will return to the front of the world news.

===message:I can’t comment for the rest of the world, but I think Russia very important to us.  I just think we are going to realize it too late.  When the USSR fell, I think many Russians believed we would be right there to help them get on their feet again.  When they basically hit rock bottom (thievery, criminality, “mafiasco”), I don’t think our country so much as lifted a hand to help.  They’ve helped themselves. Over the past few years, their economy has steadily improved (slowly but surely).  Personal incomes are rising and the crime rate is dropping.  I feel like I’m always being so negative on the world, but it’s basically going to pot.  Russia is a leading exporter of weapons, and their locality and the fact that they are still quite a ways from being a flourishing country and the times of today makes it very tempting for them to become involved in some waywardness.  Yes, we need their natural resources as well.  We and the rest of the world.  But in the end, we’ll just wipe them clean like we are doing everywhere else.  

Russia is strong, and they’ve proved that.  I think they are gaining ground in rebuilding themselves more rapidly than we think.  They are important because in these times, we need them on our side 100%, and we need to do whatever it is that needs to be done to kiss and make up.

Russia land mass is larger than the U.S.  If a person or a country can learn something from another country then that country is important.  For example, some country learn how to live like the people in Russia, and the most common thing other countries learn from Russia is how to speak their language.  Oh yeah, I think the U.S. need to be ready if Russia decided to have a war, because they are still dealing with nuclear arsenal.

===message:Russia will always be important to themselves and other countries because they hold valuable resources such as oil, gas and other minerals that other countries are in dire need of.  Eventually these countries will have to pay for what they lack and this will increase the welfare of the country and the people.  However, I feel that Russia is a mean and stubborn country and one would have to tread lightly in order to maintain peace and a decent relationship.  I think that once the country realizes that they are an important part of our world, their attitudes might possibly change.

===message: By growing up in europe,russia always was the bad guy.
And what I have read and heard ,in the moment it is a powerful breading ground for corruption.The term russian mafia is well known in germany. Avrage people are disperate and unorganized in their efforts a lot of time that spells disaster.Crime and corruption  seems to be the only thing that is organized.And a lot of good people get hurt this way .A couple years ago there was a sail ship meeting(Sail 2000 The worldwide festival of Windjammers ,happens every 4 years ) in my home town with ships from russia the" Krusenstern " was there  and it 
was in a bad shape no money to keep up the ship or crew ,condition were bad four years before that .So in Bremerhaven was a group of businesses and other people to help supply their needs.The russian Marines on the ship had poor clothing,blankets and foods and repair on the ship there made. The reason I'm telling you about this is that  I meet some of the russian before and there were people like you and me  trying to do a job they hardly got paid for. Trying to represent there country and culture the best way they could,being some what upset about the lost of the culture things.Yes I think russia is important to watch,because of the corruption and crimes it effects everybody.And I  believe russia also needs help not loose all the culturel things and to help to develope properly without destroying the environment.

===message:Russia is important for several reasons. I, like Mr. Byrd, remember the days of the cold war and the profound anxiety that we were on the brink of disaster due to Communist hostilities. Russia was seen as very powerful. But now look at them....hardly holding it together if at all. It is a good lesson in how a gov't which seems so powerful can crumble. Another reason Russia is important is because the region is in such a flux that anyting can happen over there. It is to the world best interest that they get it together. What struck me in the text about Russia is the severe pollution. This should be a valuable lesson to the rest of the world how damaging industrial pollution is. There is alot to be learned from studying the histroy of Russia.
