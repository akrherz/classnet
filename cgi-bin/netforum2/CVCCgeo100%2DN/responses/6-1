===message:Europe needs immigrants because thier population is decreasing. They oppose immigrants because if immigrants came to europe they would no long be europeans. They would now be a mixed race. This is not racism it is that they would no longer be called europeans, they would have some european and some other country in thier blood. Europe prides their self on their culture. Unlike the american which come from all over the world.

===message:Europe needs immigration to offset their aging population.  The women are choosing to have fewer if any children, so there will be no one to pay for the elderly in several years.  Immigrants help expand the tax base.  I believe people oppose immigration out of ignaorance and fear both.  They are afraid these people will take their jobs.  and they are ignorant of the need their country has for the immigrants.  They are also ignorant and afraid of the cultures they do not understand.

===message:I don't think Europe necessarily need immigrants, but there's nothing wrong with trying to make population larger.  I think when it comes to the way Europe acts towards immigrants is the same reason some people in America act that way.  It is a little bit of all three: nationalism, racism and fear.  When someone from another country comes into your country you don't know what their reason is for being there so it makes people wonder.  It makes them think that maybe they are there for negative reasons although they may not be.

===message: Europe needs immigrants for two main reasons. The first is for labor. Most immigrants go to Europe to get a job and better themselves. Most of them are not well educated and take the jobs that no one else wants. They are paid low wages and work hard for every dollar they make. Many Europeans may not realize how important these immigrants are. They may take jobs away, but if they were not there to do these jobs, the jobs probably would not get done. At my work the majority of our dishwashers are immigrants. No one else wants to be a dishwasher, and if they are hired to be a dishwasher within a few months they are promoted to a better position. The majority of immigrants are not taking away jobs from the Europeans. They are allowing Europe to offer  better jobs. If the immigrants take the unwanted jobs that have to be done in a buisness,like a dishwasher, then the Europeans are able to work the better jobs and all the work gets done.Different people oppose to immigrants for different reasons, but if they sat down and thought about it they would realize that immigrants are needed. Europeans don't just need immigrants for working purposes. They also need them to help reproduce and keep their countries running since most of them think a life of luxury is more important then having a family. If their death rate is higher then their birth rate what is going to happen in European countries in 50 years without immigrants?

===message:Europe opposed immigration because they feel that those who are not born nationals are taking jobs that the nationals should have.  There are jobs, however, that the nationals don't want to do, that are too demeaning for them.  For that reason, the immigrants are needed, to maintain the bottom rungs of their system.

Is it racism? Is it Nationalism? Ignorance? Fear?

Certainly racism caused serious problems for the jews and some other groups of people in Europe in the 1930s and 40s, so it is rational to wonder if these seeds are still being sown.  Nationalism has come to the forefront from those who are afraid of losing their individuality under the European Union concept.  Fear certainly has a place, since they are fearful of losing control of the politics and the economy to those who come from other places. Ignorance?  Probably, but it is likely that other human foibles drive their opposition, given the higher levels of education obtained by Europeans.

===message:Well the numbers preseneted in Mr. Byrds presentation indicates that europe needs immigrants. I would say that Europes resistance to immigrants is based on racism, nationalism,ignorance and fear. Even though I think immigrants should be able to stay in Europe, maybe they should send them home and get so that Europe can get what they deserve...a weaker economy. It is pretty sad actually...Europe needs immigrants but yet they mistreat them and make them feel unwanted. It seems to always come down to the haves and the have nots. Makes me wonder if the people on this planet will ever get it together and realize that we are all humans living on this one planet. Humanity needs to grow up and realize that we are all people who love our families and that ultimately that we are more alike than different. This world will be plagued with problems as long as nations have this separtist ideas.

===message:I feel Europe needs immigrants to help them with their jobs.  They feel that immigrants from around the world could help them make their country better.  They oppose immigrants just like Americans do, immigrants can come in and take over job positions that should be available to qualifying Americans first and then offered to immigrants from all around. Racism yes has a part to do with it, because most jobs only want American people that have lived here their entire life.  Fear is a good word to describe them taking away job openings that should go first to Americans.  To be "French" if feel means to have been born in France or have relatives of that country.  Same as with Germany.  But with English that is different because you have ENGLAND and AMERICA.  Everyone in England is English to me.  Americans are not specifically english because there are many americans that have lived here a year and be called American but be of some other country.

===message:Europeans are their own culture. They have their standards of people. Immigration stops or at least slows down the  way they vision the world and their country to operate. The thought of having such a diverse economy is a threat, not saying it would be a bad change, but it would be something they could work with. When you speak of what it means to be something (American, French, etc...)you are representing your country and what it stands for. Maybe Europes view on immigration isnt racial or ignorance. In my opinion their doing what most other countries would do, protect their country and their culture as well. America for example.

===message:Europe needs immigrants because the people of Europe are not reproducing. Most of the people in Europe are too old to do manual labor. People in Europe are not having enough kids to keep up with the demand in the work force. They need immigrants to work. The people of Europe opposed immigration because they don't like the thought of immigrants or their children being considered natural born citizens of Europe. I believe that it is nationalism, racism, ignorance,  and fear altogether. It is racism because they hate that particular group simply because of their race. It is nationalism because they think only the natural born citizens are worthy of citizen status. It is ignorance because they don't take the time to try to understand these people and their point of views. It is fear because they are scared of the immigrants taking over. People consider themselves to be french, english, or german because of their heritage, language, and the part of europe in which they were born.

===message:Europe needs immigrants for the same reason americans need immigrants, to do the work no one wants to do.  The oppose immigration because of racism nationalism, ignorance, and fear.  i think almost everyone opposes immigration in some form.  A lot of people are scared of change.  To the French, German, and English people their name is who the are and who the represent.  I think the identities will be as flexible and the American name at some time in the future.

===message:Europe needs immigrants,to do some of the jobs,that they 
do not want to do,same as here.A lot of immigrands do the hard physical labor.And they do need  the money they create  in taxes to pay for social security.They also need the immigrants ,to prevent the population from getting to old because of the low birth rate .In some countrys
the unemployment rate is higher that leads to oppositions they are afraid that the jobs be taken by immigrants.I do not think that it is racsism since people are more concern how you act and not what you look like.Maybe some nationalism, in the good way to keep once culture and inheritence,keep the language and customs.People are afraid to  loose them ,to have no identity.I think the textbook is right solong you assimilate to the country of your choice,you do fine in Europe.Beeing French means having French traditions and values and surporting the french soccer team,some for beeing German having German values and traditions and surporting the German soccer team, some for beeing English,English traditionsand values and surporting the English soccer team.In America  you can be American and still  keep your traditons,because a lot of American traditions are the same or came  from Europe it is a culture melting pot and you pick what you like to follow.Were are pockets of Italien,German,Irish,Korean and Mexican all over the place.And you can still support your soccer team.(Soccer is a big deal  in Europe,you can get killed  by supporting the wrong team)Even america requires for Immigrants to learn the  english language that is the only language reguired in school. I know in Germany ,english is taught as a second language and  you have a choice of a third language like French,Italian,Spanish,Russian,Latin evenso they want to assimilate they still give you an option to learn about other cultures.If you want to live in that Country of your choice you need to adapt to them there is only one melting pot and that is the USA,so everywhere else you got to do what it takes to bekomme German , French or English.

===message:I think it is pretty sefish of them to act this way. They are not thinking of their future or their kids future. They are only thinking of their own convenience. I do believe it is a form of racism. Racism is treating other races differently because they are not like you. That is what seems to be happening here. They may not understand other cultures but they have to treat others like humans and not immigrants.

===message:It is quite surprising how America and Europe show their reaction to immigrants in similar ways. Yes we need your help when times are tough or jobs we don't want to do ourselves but, after we are caught up or doing well we want them to go back because they are taking away from us. I wouldn't call it racism I call it looking out for ones own interest and family. Is it fair? No. All immigrants should understand from past experience what to expect when entering a forgein country to work in. I have voiced my opion previously about immigration and if I lived in Europe it would still be the same.

===message:Europe need migrant workers or "guest workers" in order to fill low paying positions that the other citizens of this country do not want to fill.
There are some prejudices against immigrants in Europe.  The citizens blame these people for the higher unemployment rate and rising crimes.  Police and the local government are finding immigrants on the streets and evicting them from the country without giving them a chance to find work or become a citizen.
