===message:I think that each side wants to be in power. I  think that a power struggle is motivating their actions. From reading the information one side is trying to promote peace and the other desires violent acts. When the media decides to show the naked truth about what is going on there is going to be a hugh impact on what the viewers think and what that have to say in the matter. I think that the media shouldn't display everything because you have emotional people that oppose to violence all together. But since it is the truth I  guess every one can and will voice there opinion on what is going on. I think that it should be more reverance in this city. Because it is where Christ made a hugh impact in his life. And where it started some much for us today. It layed the pathway for salvation and repentance for us. It's too much war among them and not enough love for God.

===message:This is a hard dicussion topic. While I feel very strongly in that we are to support our troops, I also feel that the causalities of war will be great. I belive too that it is a struggle for power. I think that in some cases we are showing too much on TV. Their broadcasting of American soildiers being killed and brutlized incites the people to keep fighting. It is the same way the protest that we have seen, if we only show the negative it will become only negative. I am not sure if this is what you wanted as a n answer. But it was my feelings on the subject and one more thing. I feel that the difference in religions should not be a major factor if each side is serving God who only wnat peace and love for you neighbor.

===message:The Palestinians and the Israelis are motivated by their desire to hold on to what they consider their homeland.  In that the area was home to the events surrounding Christ and the events surrounding Mohammed, they both feel they have claim to the land.  They are also motivated by their respective past histories of domination of the region.  The Israelis dominated the region in ancient times, and the Palestinians as recently as this century.  They are also motivated by their needs for water and sustenance.  Now that dual occupancy is a fact in the area, there is hardly enough water or food (not imported) to sustain the large population.

Who is winning the media "spin" between Israel and the Arabs, including the Palestinians?  That depends on one's perspective.  According to current U.S. led propaganda, Israel is certainly "winning".  That doesn't necessarily mean they are right. "Right" is entirely too subjective to determine by watching CNN exclusively.  The Palestinians have "lost" their heritage, the Israelis have regained theirs at a premium price.  Maybe when the war is over in Iraq, they'll give it to Yassar Arafat's followers.  Even out the playing field for a while.  At least until the Kurds get enough equipment to wage a war of their own...tongue desperately searching for a place in cheek to land...

===message:I think the motivation comes from thier belief. If one dies in the conflict they are the heros. Thier religious belief in a false god has lead to the destruction for their own lives as well as thier countries. I feel as though the media in America is doing our troops and our country an injustices. They seem to be anti-american. I would hope that our troops are unable to view the anti-war protest that are taking place across the United States. Yes, you have a right to disagree with the war, however there are men and women that are fighting for that very freedom you have to disagree. I feel as Americans we should be constantly in prayer for our troops and the future of our nation. And as far as the media is concerned, they need to show more support for our nation and its leaders. And stop trying to hang them on a cross somewhere.

===message:The motivation for the conflict between the Israleis and the Palestinians is religion and political.  The politicians use the issue of religion and homeland to further their case.  Both of the religions are based on peace but this is the one thing everyone seems to forget.  Politicians use religion to get their people to do what they want.  They twist the orginal words of the bible or the koran to mean what is convienient at the time.  In my opinion neither side is winning the media spin.  I believe both sides are behaving badly.

We are trying to treat the Arabs with a respect that humans deserve.  However, they are taking that and using it against us.  They are showing only what they want their own countrymen to see, and twisting it and distorting it so that they are hating us.. They see us as monstrous killers and not for what we really are.. liberators..

===message:The motivation of the ongoing battle between Palestine and the Israelis seem to be a result of religious bias and also poor mismanagement by the government.  The Israeli Army is bullying the Palestian citizens and getting away with it because the government is backing the police and the army.  More and more of these citizens are being killed each day by the soldiers and police, even children as young as 5 months of age.  I feel that the Palestinans are winning the Media "spinning" of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Each article I read talked about how the palestines were being beaten, stoned, bombed, and mismanaged by their government.

===message: I think there are several things motivating the on going battle between the Palestinians and Israelis. They both want control and power. They argue over their personal religion preference. They also have to deal with the fact that there is not enough water and food for both cultures to live comfortably. I think that even if all their personal problems over religion and natural resources were solved they would still argue. They will always be caught up in a power struggle. It reminds me of how sisters and brothers are. No matter how perfect things are between them they always struggle to get more attention than the other. I think that both sides are wrong and they have to learn to get along before they can even start to settle their differences. From all the pictures that I have seen and articles that I have read the Palestinians are winning the pity and support of the rest of the world due to the harshness that is shown through the media. I also think that we do not get to see everything that goes on, just what the media wants us to see. Unless the Palestinians and Israelis can learn to live with each other many innocent people will continue to be hurt and killed on both sides.

===message:I think that they are motivated by more than just religion (such as politics or power), but I think that when you are dealing with something as deeply personal as religion you find that people are willing to go farther for their cause. People are not as open minded when it comes to conflicting religions and religion seems so deeply embedded in every part of their culture. As for who is winning the media "spinning" I honestly can't say. It depends on who you ask because like you said, the media is so biased. Obviously Americans are less likely to be sympathetic with the Arabs now that we are at war with Iraq. I consider myself open minded but like many Americans, my husband is leaving for Iraq in two days, and I have learned from experience that personal experience can overshadow a persons ability to hear a different perspective.

People twisting their relious beliefs to make them say what they want them to say. All this betraying and judgement going on and no one seems to be winning. If they say they are winning, what are they truely winning? According to most religous beliefs the so called "GOD" is the only one who should judge people and peace and harmony is suppose to rein.All this fighting seems not to be providing much aide to either side and neither one seems to be gaining much. Hopefully one the day the Arabs and Isralites will come to peace with each other and true religion and government will be known.

===message:I personally haven't followed this conflict to any great length, but from what I have gathered, it seems as though Palestine is using the same terrorist activity towards Isreal as Sadam and Osama uses towards the US. It's tough to say what is motivating these two countries other than power and religion. The media will always have the upper hand because it's our main source of real time information. The faster we get the information, the more we believe what we see and hear. May not be credible but we still except it at face value.

===message:I think motivation comes from a negative or positive factor in which both sides have demonstrated that they all believe they are right.  Common sense should tell people where there is no peace in the land or home, there is no power.  Who should determine why people hate each other?  They are instilling in their minds and their family that war is the only solution to a problem.  I understand that the water is scarce and everyone wants more, but as christians, why don't they ask God for more rain.  There is a solution to every problem, you just have to wait until you discover the answer.  My prayers are with our soldiers who I feel are wasting their lives for senseless power and control.  I do feel that Bush is a terrible president for not finding other ways of solving the world's crisis.  This is why he's called the president.  One would think that we have seen enough fighting in the other countries, and I am saying this bcause I'm an american and we have freedom of speech.  No one is winning the media "spinning" because everyone involved is getting hurt and lives are being taken as we speak.  The media talks too much, some things should be revealed after they have already taken place because we don't know who is our enemy at this point.  We should not  hear all the details because for some, it's too painful and unecessary.  Bush should send his daughters to the military and let them fight and then he would understand that these are not just toy soldiers playing with a water gun.

that Jorden and Syria where given,like it was orignaly was intended to have their own state. The other problem would be the over population and under education in Palestinian area . And from both sides the fundermentalists and extremist would have to compromise

Even though we are over there dieing and risking our lives the other countries see that as okay because of how the media portrays us.

===message:I agree with Kathy's statements very much on this subject. Jerusalem is the homeland of both the Palenstinians and the Isralies. My understanding is that a segment of the Palenstiniam population was displaced when the Israli nation was etablished. The US historically has sympathized with the Israel though I think their policies are beginning to become a thorn in the US side. The US support Israel has caused a lot of resentment in the Muslim world hence the problems we are having today. If people think we have a terriosm problem today wait till what is in store for us in the future. I am afraid we have kicked a hornets nest. Because US policy has been in support of Israel the media spin usually is in favor of Israel. People who deny that we have our own propaganda (esp. against Muslims) are naive. Let's not forget we use to be friends with Saddam long ago during the Iran/Iraq war! Also, some of you may have heard of an American student who was recently killed by the Israeli soldiers. She was standing in front of some Palenstinian homes trying to protect them from being bulldozed down. They ran over her thinking she was just another Palenstinian. When it was discovered that she was a American student it was deemed a "tragic mistake".
