===message:I think that any way a person visualize a location, emotions or just even events make it right for them.  Just because the natives of a particular country or a state feel this is what we are about is not necessarily true.  Why would they tell you to use your imagination if it  can't be what you perceive it to be.  There are a lot of beautiful places on our planet but there are just as many bad places.  I love  to visualize what different places might spell like after the rain or on a summer breezy day.  Often times I go back to my childhood days when I lived in the country and at this point in my life, I wish I could go back and regain the memories that I lost.
