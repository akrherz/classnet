===message:I think that different places not only could look different to other people but it could also look different as a person grow.  What I mean by this is that when I was younger my family and I use to go to Indiana every other  year to attend family reunions and everything was just so exciting to see a different city and to be in a different surrounding.  But now when I visit Indiana it seems like it's just part of the hood.  All the building that are up there to me is just like the building down south, just about half of them need to be torn down and rebuilt.  But even though I see a different view in it now than I did when I was younger there's, my kids see the same things I saw when I was younger that I don't see now.

===message:I strongly agree with everything you said about going back to the place where you grew up. I grew up in a small rural community in Alabama (yes, even smaller than Columbus)and whenever I visit I feel like I'm going back into time. Although I only lived there until I was about seven I cannot imagine living there today. My perception of the place is something totally different now that I have adapted to my new environment. To me it's like the people who live there are part of another culture. This includes everything from style of dress to mindset. YOu asked if you left Georgia and came back years later would you think differently? I think that I can say yes. When we learn new things we tend to think they are better. This doesn't mean that how we live is better, it's just the fact that perceive it to be.
