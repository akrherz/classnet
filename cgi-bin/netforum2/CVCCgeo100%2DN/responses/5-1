===message:just as Argentina is now feeling the bite of the worlds ecomonic trouble many other south/central american coutries have felt the hardship many years ago. Leadership is were it all begins but it doesn't stop there. Look at countries like columbia and costa rica in their shipping and banking industries. They have squeezed the economy to the point its held hostage. If the owner/execs aren't willing to work with its employees and people with business loans then you'll have strikes,layoffs and closings. With business you also have to look at those accounting numbers we in amercia have came to see to often. What the countries in south/central america need to face is the fact that economic woes come from various reason and  not just one source. It not all the fault of the government b/c they look at as "if it ins't broke then don't fix it" and before you know it your in the shapre that you see today. Everyone has to lose something for it to turn around. Not just in south america but the world economy in general.

===message:I think that South America has so much financial problems because they don't have enough funding.  Although they do have strong leader they do not always have control how things are done.  Maybe if someone, I don't know who, could come in and help finacially then maybe things would be better.  I think the main problem would be that maybe they are spending more than they actually have.  Does that makes sense?  However though it may be fixed depending on if they can cut back with spending of find an expenisive export they could trade with another country or something.

===message:Althoug Argentina is struggling, many other South American economies are falling afterwards. Economies such as Brazil,and Latin America's largetst economy Uraguay and Paraguay are now feeling the wake of the financial meltdown six months ago in Argentina. Because of the fast spread of the crisis it has gave little notice for planning on how this can be mended, but the spread has threatend many other surrounding countries which is why this has became such a crisis for the South American region. On a more personal note, I feel that the natives of the countries are not supporting or at least aiding there own political decision, how can the countries come together if at all to try and stop or slow the problems there facing. Maybe they would see a better end picture if they looked at the long tern benifits.

===message:I know you think leadership is a lame answer to Argentina's problems; however, it takes leadership to put a plan into action.  A plan does nothing until there is someone that can implement it.  I think that Argentina needs to help it's citizens get back on their feet.  One way to do this may be putting them to work.  Like President T. Rosevelt did during the great depression.  He put americans to work on any project he could come up with.  They were paid by the government.  They built roads, lodges, anything that was possible to put men back to work.

South America is like any other country it needs help to get back on its feet.  the country has to realize that the only way to get out of debt is to sell more than you buy.

===message:I don't think the problem is so much the government but the dependency on agriculture and minerals. Let's face it, you can't compete in the global economy selling fruit. Even their minerals are not going to compare to the kinds of industries offered by powerhouses like the U.S. or Japan. They don't seem to have placed enough priority on factories or businesses. Or like Brazil, they make the mistake of selling out what industry or business might give them a fighting chance if enough effort were put in. Selling to foreign investors is like shooting yourself in the foot. It is like you have a diamond in the rough, and you sell it to someone else to shine it up and get the profit.

===message:This is a hard discussion topic, it is hard to know exactly what could be done to help out Argentina and the other struggling countries of South America. I know strong leaders are not the answer partly because, a leader is only as strong as their followers. I think they need to look at new ways of using their resources and even though it may be shaky their tourism. The drug trade is part of the problem especially in Cuba, where it is in a constant battle between the drug cartile and the authorities. There is no easy answer or solution to the problems.

===message:I agree  that "strong leader " will not fix the problem.
The problem is there is only a small amount of well educated people ,they also control the plantations and the industries and they are not required to change that.It could be a problem to educate the poor people they might be able to read what kind of pesticide they are working with.If you always aspect people to just get by they will just get by.Plantation owners, Industrie owners foreign or domestic should be required to educate the people that work  for them or there children.After a generation or two ,you would have a better work force than plain labor.
And would not have to depend on people from other countries to do the jobs that pay higher wages.A lot of foreign investors in industries have to bring  people in  because in most places is cheap labor but not for more complex jobs. Educate people how to improve,that just migrating to the city does not bring a better job. Built up a system that supports families and educate them.If you look around the world most countries that do well.Have a majority of well educated people.Take the power from a small elite group make them take care of the rest or let them enpower the rest to do well and not to be a burden to them.

===message:Just about every South American country is struggling with social and economic issues.  Colombia is in the constant throes of guerilla warfare between drug lords and between the U.S. and the drug lords.  Venezuela is currently on strike, countrywide, so no oil is being produced and the workers are earning no wages.  

When South America was initially invaded by the Europeans, they began to set up mass export business, depleting the land and the people of their resources.  This practice has been practiclly impossible to overcome.  Still, large international conglomerates control most of the valuable property in almost every country and contol the people by controlling the work opportunities.  Socialism didn't do much to improve the situation, since there was no privitization of businesses within the framework, none of the workers had the potential for economic gain that would have encouraged them to create marketable products successfully.  The countries that were most likely to succeed in business are crushed under tremendous debt.  

The free trade association, the Mercosur, that is forming could be a tremendous boon to the overall economy.  If individual countries, like our individual states, join together to combine their earning power, in theory at least, it could be the way to a new way of introducing the benefits of capitalistic reforms.

===message: I think that Argentina is causing their own problems. Instead of them working together as a country they are working against each other. The wealthy are only worried about become wealthier while the poor is becoming poorer. If Argentina could come together and try to better their uneducated people they would probably be better off. It might take time, but after time their efforts would help build a better, stronger, wealthier country. Argentina's dept is not a new problem and a couple of more years of them being in dept will not kill them(unless somebody really wants their money). Right now they have so many uneducated people in their country that are more of a burden then anything else. If the country could come up with some type of common wealth until more of their people are educated,  in the long run these uneducated people would give back more to the country then what was ever given to them.

===message:I agree with the one who said that the people of argentina are working against each other rather than to help each other. Its just like in America over the past year everyone has come togethor in a time of crisis and it seems to have helped tremendously. Argentina needs to do the same they need to stop worrying so much about themselves as an individual and start worrying about themselves as a whole. This would probably bring everyone togethor and decrease the problems rather than making the problems worse.

===message:I think that South America as a whole need to be more educated and care for their own people. All of the countries have an elite set of people, including the leaders and politicians; that seem to have their own agenda. We as Americans are encouraging the poor people of these countries, we tend to work them at a low wage,even on jobs that many Americans would not do. Many missionaries have and are going to help these countries, but I have learn over the years one must what to help themselves before any change are made. I guess there is no quick fix!

===message:Leadership is only a small part of any government. In the USA we have had both strong and weak presidents this however has not made our country weak like many South and Central American countries. The one aspect that I think has helped America stay strong is our efforts to EDUCATE our people. If a person is not properly educated they can not function and produce at the rate of others who are. I feel Argentina, Brazil, and other countries need to focus on educating their citizens. Another issue is the SAP. I understand that investors want their money back but, taking away jobs, support for the poor, and letting the rich get richer has proven NOT to work. Why not train and educate the people so they can benefit society and industries. Taking land, food, and support will only lead to more failure. I think if someone could figure out away to have the rich give back to the country (including foreign industries) and the money spent on improving their citizens and enviroment which in the long run may promote interest from new companies might help their economic problems. Also if the people would have the strength to demand better working conditions and wages this also might higher their standards and economy.

===message:Venezuela, for example, is one of many struggling South American countries. Their problems lie deeper than poor leadership. They are one of the main countries that supply the U.S. and other nations with oil. An internal conflict is causing the price of gas in the United States to sky rocket. I agree that Argentina is under the rule of poor leadership, but that alone should not cause a nation to struggle. For a country to prosper, they must have a strong government, economic stability, urban development, and a good environment.

===message:Argentina and Cuba are two South American countries that I know of that are having serious economic and political issues.  Argentina's debt is enormous for such a small country and they are not making any progress in paying it off.  Instead Argentina is getting into more debt trying to stabilize their troubled economy.  The riots and looting are adding more burdens to the already failing economy.  I do sympathize with the residents.  The fear of not having steady income and little to no food is overwhelming for the people of this country.  
The president(s) will not be able to solve the economies problems overnight or even 1 year.  This fix is going to take stratigies that are planned and tested by the government and the people.  In the meantime, the government needs to establish an immediate plan to encourgage/help the people who have lost their jobs and who are starving so that the looting will stop and the country can begin to heal.

===message:As we all know, we are the richest country in the world and have done quite well because we have taken risks in helping others.  But, we too, have done some hurtful and criminal things to keep our economy flowing.  Argentina and Cuba are doing bad now because whatever they did in the past, it stopped happening.  I'm sorry for their misfortunes, yet we still have major crimes in our country because some if not most of our citizens of all races and background feel they can do whatever the hell they please and walk away free.  Though we may not punished all our criminals, we tend to not ship drugs to other countries to make monies or kill innocent people.  The country needs someone who is willing to reach out and ask another country to stand by them and help them through their financial woes and in return, they need to be there for each other.  for example, they could possibly import and export each other goods, accept citizens as citizens of their country, and structure some beautiful area as a possible tourism site and keep drug catrel away from that area by explaining how it would benefit the country.  Or they could build plants that will give people a decent salary and maybe find a product or produce that can be consistently shipped to other countries.  I know things are hard in that part of the world because of situations I'm unaware of but if the country wants to strive and stop looting and stealing, then the people have to have a vision for their land and stand up and start rebuilding what was once successful.

Nevertheless, I agree that Argentina has had strong leaders, but I don't feel they were strong minded.  A person leading a country should be able to overcome any problems.  Argentina would not have as many problems if the people would come together and understand what their Government is trying to do.

I think that they are struggling, because they are not trying to make thing better for themselves in their everyday life. It is hard to do better if they have other countries with drugs problem such as Cuba. This is a big problem for the South American countries and there's nothing we can do about it unless they want help for the problems they are struggling with.
