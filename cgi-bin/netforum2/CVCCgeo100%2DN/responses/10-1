Not that the war in Congo isnt important and it should be taken seroiusly, but when we have our own war brewing over here I suspect people would not be focusing to much on others countries problems.

===message:Due to Africa being a third world country with the ending of a aparthi most people have forgiven what white regime had done to S. Africa. Also with the ending of the cold war news focussed elsewhere forgetting those left behind. Now that Africa is not the only country in need of severe humanine help the focuss on them has now spread outward to others in need also. I also feel with our own homeland crisis many are much more interested in it than others whom have been helped.

There is always one thing after another first the Sept. 11th incident now this war issue. We leave no media or any kind of other attention for anyone to get.

First, they are not in the global economic market like many of the countries today. Lets face it there is really nothing that they would export that is consumed by the golbal market. Secondly, they are not self sufficient, they rely on other conutries for a large pecentage for the very food that they consume.

It is sad though that we can not do more to help the warring parties of Africa. I think with strong democratic leadership and much needed aid they could turn their lives around. They did make the Australian news just the other day, the headlines read: "1000 killed in the Congo". I do not know if was on the news in America or not. So many things have plauqed these people for so long, that in some sense it has become normal to us and just don't have a reaction anymore, it's kind of like reading a billboard that you pass everyday, after a while you no longer notice it.

Nor do they have the capability to make weapons of mass destruction.  Therefore, the deciding authorities of the UN do not feel it is necessary to intervene in the Congo War.

We have an "interest" in Iraq so therefor we must "liberate" these people. Personally I think the media mostly puppets what out gov't wants them to broadcast. Most Americans live like kings compared to so many in the world. So how do we pick and choose our efforts? We dress up things in lofty packages but I am afraid we only help those whom we stand to benefit from.

===message:One reason you don't hear about what is going on Africa is because war in the Congo does not have a direct affect on U.S. citizens. They are not flying passenger jets into the World Trade Center and they are not America's Cash Cow. There are no weapons of mass destruction aimed at California. I don't think President Bush will put the Congo on his list of top 10 countries to liberate. Africa will ultimately exterminate themselves over time, by fighting bloody wars, or AIDS/HIV. I think most of the world has given up hope and it would seem like making a bad investment if the U.S. and the media started directing it's attention to a country that has such a grim future. If the President isn't interested at moment, at least 70% of America isn't interested.

===message:The events since 9-11 have seemed to overshadow problems/conflicts from around the world, but this mess with congo has been going on long before that.  I was getting out of the military in May 2000, and I still remember reading and hearing reports about the crisis unfolding in Rwanda and other places.  In general, I think that we view peacekeeping as inappropriate in the context of African wars, because we believe there's no peace to keep.  I don't think that what is happening over directly affect us, and so our government doesn't want to meddle.  Washington is not really serious about getting involved in Africa in any way that could make a difference.  They are of no risk to us.  We just stand back and say we feel their pain.  This is why we hear so little about it.

I think that they would care very much if they were educated. However, the media in this country isn't as concerned with educating anymore. The goal of the media in our country is to get tv ratings and since they realize that Africa is not a focus for most of us, they aren't about to risk their ratings to really inform us. It scares me that so much of my generation cares more about pop singers and reality tv shows than it does the world we live in.

===message: If a multi-billionaire was to be killed would it make the news? If our country was to get mad at another wealthy country would we change the name of french fries? The only people that make it to the news are the ones with power and wealth. We as individuals may not admit that power and wealth are the only things that make a difference in our lives, but if one takes a look at our country he will see that this is true. Most of the people in our country work 40 hours plus a week, go to school, and spend at least 4 hours a week working on a geo online class. Do we do this to better our children, live a happy life, or to further our education? Most people do it for the money, power, and wealth. Our society looks down on people that don't have the finest in life. In our society if you are poor you are a nobody.Many people might argue with this fact, but all they would have to do is look at the wars in Africa.I think because Africa does not have money they are not considered news worthy. I don't think that it has anything to do with our war going on. When anything major happens in a wealthy country, with or without are war going on, it is broadcasted, but Africa is poor and not considered worthy of our news coverage. I think it is sad that because people are poor we as a world would take advantage of them and use them to better ourselves. If this world would pay Africa what they deserve for their exports and help them get on their feet a little bit, instead of us using them to get cheap raw materials, they might be able to survive. It might cost us a little bit extra in the long run, but which is more important someone starving to death or us having to pay $1.29 for a coke-cola instead of $0.99? If the world would quit being greedy and quit only helping people when we benefit from it Africa might make it on the news!

About the Congo... this war is a mishmash of Tutsi rebels, backed by Rwanda and Uganda who are mad at the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for harboring Hutus, who are not Congolese by the way, who committed genocide against the Tutsis in 1994 (killed over 800,000 Tutsis).  They signed a peace agreement in July last year.  It lasted about 3 months.  The Tutsis want the Congo's coltan....as do the Hutus.  They also want their diamonds, gold, cobalt and copper.  Nobody seems to care what the people of the Congo want, especially the people of the Congo.  Rwandans have backed off lately though, since the price of coltan has dropped to $20-30 a pound from the $240 a pound they were getting at the height of their war.  Coltan, by the way, is a metallic ore used in small circuits found in cell phones, laptops and pagers.  Hmmmmm.... that makes me think of Nextel, Ma Bell, Bill Gates, hardware manufacturing concerns.  Maybe those guys need the coltan bad enough to use their vast funds to prevent the media from covering the situation in the Congo as pervasively as it has covered Iraq?  With oil men in power in the U.S., I guess we'll have to wait til Bill Gates or his prodigy are in the white house to see our armies "liberate" the Congo...

just a rough theory...

I think the many different nations on this continent need to band together and work on solving issues together.  They need to creat something along the lines of the EU with a governing body that can help direct the progress of the entire continent.  I did look for some articles on the internet regarding the Congo- the BBC seems to have done quite a bit of reporting on the situation, and I saw some articles from the Sydney Herald.  However, I did not see much from the U.S.  We seem to be focused on our own issues these days.
