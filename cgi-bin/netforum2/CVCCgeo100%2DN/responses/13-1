===message:China has a great mind and power throughout their country.  They remind me of another United States in a way of the way they run their country.  You rarely ever hear of them bothering another country.  They could soon be the next great power with them having their head on straight.  I know they could survive with their standings right now.

===message:I do not believe that China is the next great superpower.  They do not have the checks and balances in their government to allow them to become the next superpower.  Their leaders have too much power and their history of human rights abuse is too prevelent.  Their comuunist party has made strides in treating the citizens better; however, they seem to me still unwilling to have their authority questioned.

===message:I think that China may be the next great power, but first they have to work on some important issues that they have. They need to improve their water supply to certain areas(which they are in the process of doing), they need to form some kind of common wealth to help their citizens in the rural areas, they need to fix their food production problems, and come up with some kind of regulations to decrease their pollution.If China continues to improve within their country instead of declining they may become the next great power, but I do not see this happening for many years. China still has too many people going without clean water and they can barely produce enough food to feed themselves. Every country has problems, but how often do you walk into someone's house in the U.S. and they not have any water suitable for drinking or when was the last time you saw someone using an animal to help them farm their land? China may have some people with power already, but there are still too many people who are going without for them to become a great power. In the U.S. there are homeless people standing on the streets, but there are also places to help them people, like the Valley Rescue Mission. China must learn how to be strong within their country before they will ever be seen as a great power.

As a whole the country seems to have its act togethor, not to mention all of the exporting and manufacturing they do for the US. So, yes I think China could be a great power in the future.

===message:I think that Chia could be the next great power only if they improve the problems that they are having today. agriculture is one of the main problems that they need to address. Their water, their living conditions and theeir economy situations.I think that they have potential to have great power mainly because if their production capacities. They are the major leading exports for many of the things that we use today. even with all this being said I dont think that this will take place no time soon.

There are many people in China who are struggling to do the right things for each other.  I wouldn't think they'd be a country for us or anyone else to tamper with in an imperialistic way.

===message:China will never be a superpower if they cannot deal with their environmental issues of poor air quality, water problems, and its repressive attitudes towards women. I feel that China will always be a productive country. With human physical needs at risk, such as clean air and water, becoming a super power will be virtually impossible. Are they a force to be reckoned with? Yes because there is strength in numbers in the Chinese Military. They have the largest military in the world, however they are lacking in technology. 
Estimates state there are over 100 million unemployed or underployed people who are not accounted for. The unemployment rate is 20% in some areas. I don't see China ever being a superpower but I do see them continuing to improve on all the problems listed above in the future.

They have a lot going for them and I believe they are more powerful than the United States gives credit for. They seem to be quite and to themselves, which could mean that they have something to hide. It could mean that they have great power.

===message:China becoming a "superpower" is certainly in the making, they have taken the economic step that they need to begin this movement from second tier nation to so called "superpower". If you look at the parallels from Russia during the time of the cold war to the fall of the comminist party they are so close that china may be a "superpower" and we haven't even realized it yet. If you look a them from the outside you can bring up many reason why they would not make it but every country including america has economic,political and enviromental issues but look at the world stage and since america is the only "superpower" left standing china is in the best position to become the next power.

===message:No, I do not think that China is the net great power.  There are some sections of China which are prosperous while the peasants in the countryside are poor, starving and struggling to make ends meet.  The Chinese Government need to come up with a plan to help the needed in their country before they can ever consider becoming a superpower.  Otherwise they will have to worry about Civil wars in the country rather than national.

===message:China, I believe will never be the next great power because we are so caught up in power struggles that we will probably create more money to give us the upper hand.  I think the U.S. over all the nations will do one thing to make sure that we are never controlled by another country and that is for us to remain the world's richest country.  I think that before we allow China to be the next country with the great power, we would probably merge with Russia or another country that kick ass like we do .  But, I think that we will always believe and live up to our expectations that no one will ever override what we have, and that's money.  They just don't give it to our own poor people, but, instead create subsidy programs as hand outs.  Our country is something else.  If you study our habits and environments long enough, one will discover that we are a little crazy but we have a kind heart for the underdog.  Idella
