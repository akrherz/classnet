===message:It's all a matter of perspective.  The community where I live sees our grade school system as a shining example of a fine educational institution.  My granddaughters, who go to a high-achievement oriented school in a large metropolitan environment, see it as culturally deprived, not at all stimulating and a step down intellectually from where they now exist.

We see our community as safe and bucolic.  People from other environments where great restaurants are a short drive from home, varied museums are available depending on your weekend whim and newspapers and local television stations are filled with so many various perspectives and slants often find it boring and inhibited.

But I don't have traffic... they do.  I just make sure I bring home good bagels when I go visit.  They make me feel...in touch.

===message:The surroundings of an environment can make a major difference on how each person experiences a place.  For example the weather, and having to know people in that same area makes a great deal.  

I have seen that most people experience my hometown of Buena Vista, Georgia as a place to be able to sit on a cozy front porch either rocking or swinging and listening to the cars drive by.  A place to call home, if you like the country.  Some people might even say it is boring if you don't like it to be quiet and have to drive 30 minutes to a supermarket or even a decent store.

===message:One way to experience a place differently is to travel and expose onself to other cultures and ways of life. The idea of experiencing a place differently immediatly brought to my mind the opportunity I had years ago to spend a couple of months in England. It was that broadening experience that helped me to discern more what it means to be an American. It helped me to see more clearly our way of life. For example, in England, which is a very small country, space is of the premium. Most people had very small yards around there homes. Regardless, the English are avid gardeners. Even though most only had a small patch of yard in front of their homes, only a few square feet, there yards were highly cultivated. Food cost were also much higher in England, therefore; food was consumed in much smaller portions and much less was wasted. I often heard a phrase used there to desribe something that was costly as "dear". That stuck out in my mind because they seem as a whole to hold things more dearly and took better care of the things that they did have. I also had the experience of working a milk delivery route while there. I was amazed at how people would leave the money for the milk on their doorsteps, trusting that no one but the milk-delivery person would get it. When I came back to the United States, I experienced my home differenlty. I became aware of what a wasteful nation we are and how much we take for granted. We have much more land space moslty of which is uncultivated and wasted. That experience definelty opened my eyes to seeing American culture from other perspectives.

===message:Everyone is different and everyone has different outlooks on life.  A persons attitude has a lot to do with the way they perceive the world.  As a Junior in highschool my classmates and I were introduced to a foreign exchange student.  His name was Roberto and he was from Equador.  He came to the United States knowing very little English and almost nothing about our country.  Through spending time with Roberto in class and hearing his views on the world through class discusions, I learned that we are extremely different, but also very much alike.  Before he came here he viewed the United States as a utopia.  After spending time here he realized that the U.S. wasn't perfect.  He saw that we, like all other countries, had our problems.

===message:I had the opportunity to experience what life was like in the Middle East in 1990-1991.  The author of our text book talked about how men and women are treated differently in some areas of the world.  I experienced an incidence where I was in a small grocery store in Daharan, Saudia Arabia while serving in the Gulf War.  There was a Arabic male standing behind me in line waiting to check out.  I was in my military uniform with my weapon on my shoulder.  One minute he was behind me in the checkout line and then the next he was in front of me.  I was surprised.  I did not say anything or cause a scene, I just casually walked around him and got back in front of him and gave a "Don't mess with me" look.  The women are treated as second class citizens in most parts of the Middle East and the men normally take more than one wife.  Needless to say, I was happy to leave Middle East.

===message:Thank you! Traveling to other cultures can be a very educational as well as enlightening. I plan to do more (traveling that is) someday. To bad it is so expensive. I was really intersted in other ways of life as a child and was an avid penpaler. An activity I highly recommend for children but I caution adults.

===message:I also had the chance to spend some time in England.  A company I worked for had me train some new employees there.  What struck me the most was our differenct attitudes about work.  I was very young and very motivated to do a good job.  After several weeks one of the managers I was training made the point that in America we live to work but in England they work to live.  I started to pay more attention to this and realized how true it is.  A normal contract negotiated by an English business man will commonly have at least six weeks of vacation included.  In the U.S. we are lucky to get two weeks.  
This trip changed my entire perspective on my career (that and children).  I realized that I was working too hard and spending too much time on the job.  My life needed to become a higher priority than my job.  
Looking at our life through another culture can be very enlightening.  We are often too wrapped up in our own beliefs to accept that any one elses opinion may have some validity.

===message:Mr. Byrd, I have read the syllabus and understand all the requirements and the ramifications behind not doing what is supposed to be done.  I truly hope I can keep up because I have Human Geography at CSU and it's kicking my butt. If I don't know anything about the world after you and Dr. Cope finish with me,I tell you I'm a goner.  My daughter said to say hello. You taught her Geography when you first started teaching at CVCC.  Her name is Thomisha Fitzpatrick and no she didn't give me her notes because I had no idea I would be taking this class from you.  I have been in school for years trying to finish my teacher's certification.  Would you believe I graduated from Troy State University in 1980 with a double major in Journalism and Speech/Drama and I didn't take any education courses.  I can't believe I have turned into a career student because I'm almost tired of working on these goals this long.

===message:When my oldest daughter was just a baby I lived in California. I thought it was the best place on earth because if you were willing to drive 2 or 3 hours you could go to Vegas, the beach, skiing, or even Hollywood. I would even take her to Mexico with me. My oldest daughter is now six, and now I would never live there. I think about school systems, safety, and the kind of morals I want her to observe. I now see the world through the eyes of a parent.
