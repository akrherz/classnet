===message:This latest wave of immigration will effect our country by meaning more populations throughout the .U.S. More nationalities that we have to account for.  More jobs that have to be open in order for them to have a job.  
In the coming future the word "AMERICAN" will mean someone that has even immigrated here from another country and only lived here for just a few years. There are so many people from different parts of the world immigrating to become one of us with "FREEDOM" that one day the United States will be known for more than just people that have lived here there whole life.

We have the choices of the jobs we take, how much money we want to earn and where we want to live. Immigrants want the freedom we have. One way or another they will realize that there are only so many minimum wage paying jobs in this world.  As technology and the world progresses, education is so much more important now. If they want to get anywhere in this country it will take more than just crossing the boarder.

That's kind of an odd question.  I really don't know how to answer that question.

===message:I think that the immigrants that are coming to America will bring with them new ways of life. They will show us many different things just like the immigrants that came over before. We as Americans learned many new cultures, values, and traditions when immigrants came to North America the last time and I am sure we will again. We may have to learn a new language in order to communicate, but this is nothing compared to what the immigrants go through. They are coming to America to better themselves and most likely they will better are country in the long run. They are not coming here to change our ways or take over. They are coming because they have heard what a great place America is and want to be a part of it. America would not have many of its traditions today if it was not for immigrants. We would not have hot dogs, pasta, or everyone's favorite pizza.I think that not only will we benefit now from immigrants, but so will generations to come.

I don't blame these people for wanting to come to the US to enjoy freedom and pursue career goals.  However, I do have a problem with the immigrants who come to the US and 5 to 10 years down line have not made any progress or attempt to become independent from Government assistance.  This is a burden on the economy and the country as a whole.  I do believe in assisting and helping those who help themselves.  Immigrants should be allowed to enter the country with the stipulation that they ware to become contributors to the economy in a specified time frame.

===message:Immigration is out of control. Most everyone sees America as being free and able to achieve their dreams. Money galorie and all the benifits too. It is a given fact that living in America is not what it use to be years ago. The unemployment rate is up some more, wellfare is growing and still our own government lets people from everywhere enter our country when there is not enough jobs or food for the true Americans already living in America. Why should we allow others to comeinto our country and us support them too when we cannot take care of our own already living here? Yes, we are the land of the free but why are so many Americans unemployed, starving to death, or unable to get medical care if this is such a great land? Why add more people to take care of if you can't take care of what you have already. Immigrates come into our country and take work from us or better yet go on wellfare so we have to support them too. How come our government gives these people intrest free loans to help them buy a business or start a business but, us true Americans do not get such a privilge? I believe in helping others but first you must help your own. In the future America will be of all nationalities. It will be hard to figure out who is American and who is not because our population will be such a vast of different people and cultures. I think our "true american" idenity will soon fade away. Understand not all immigrants are here for the helping hand. Many immigrants have proven to be benifical to our country. All they wanted was a chance to succeed. However; many of them are here for the helping hand. Living and working illegaly in our country, having babies so they can become citizens, and adding to our already existing problem of over population, unemployment, resonable wages, and wellfare. Where and when do we stop allowing others to come into our country and start taking care of our own?

When you say that America is not what it was years ago do you mean 70 years ago when unemployment was over 25%, 90 years ago when women could not vote, 50 years ago when we still had "Jim Crow Laws", 25 years ago when we had to wait in line for gasoline, 1991 when I was in college and we were in a recession so that I was told to "stay in college as long as you can, there are no jobs"... exactly when was this golden era.  If you are going to refer to the past with a historian, you'd better be specific.

I would prefer that our country and other countries be responsible for their own criminals and blatant law breakers who try to run from justice, if the bureaucracy to handle that load is available and affordable. 

 Overpopulation is more severe in other countries than here, even with a flood of immigrants.  Who knows...we may want to immigrate to some other country one day.  Do we want to be turned away?

The next century could bring a turnabout scenario for us, or worse.  Live and let live.

===message:Oh yes, The poor immigrantes working hard doing the jobs us Americans won't do. We won't do these jobs because the pay is not enough and we "Americans" won't lower are standards and back down because we have a backbone. These so called hard working immigrantes come into our country and take jobs away from the true Americans that are already living here. No we won't work for little to nothing pay. Companies would have to pay a descent wage if these immigrants would stay out and quite working for low pay. Heck, they work so cheap that companies like (General Motors, Levis, Kathy Lee, ect..) are moving their companies to foreign countries not to have to pay descent salaries. Even according to a 20/20 show (don't know the date) immigrantes make less in a week than someone working at McDonald's for a 30 hr. week. So are they really helping improve America by keeping certain standards down? What about the loans they are given to help them with their business. A true "native born" U.S. citizen would find it very difficult to aquire the same type of loan. Yes, I agree with you that most immigrants are hard working and deserve the same chance of us. However when you start taking away from your own and giving to others or you cannot feed and support your own why take in more. Even now our school systems have had to start accommindating children depnding on their lanuage and relgious beliefs. Adding more to the school system that is already struggling.

===message: It is not true that everybody sees America as being "money galore, and all the benefits too". If you think welfare and benefits is the only reason people come
 to America, then I think that you are wrong. There are other countries that have a better welfare system then America, Germany being one of them. 
 I think a lot of people come to America because if you are willing to work hard you can still make something of yourself.
 They take low paying jobs that the average American won't do. Even with the low paying jobs they make more money here as compared to their own country. A lot of the immigrants have a different outlook on life.Americans have to have a Gameboy, X Boxes, and so on. As  a cashier I've seen a lot of Americans purchase food and pay with food stamps, then these same people buy X Boxes and DVD players for a few hundred dollars and pay in cash. The immigrants I have seen, buy food, clothing and maybe a CD or a DVD, but they pay for all in cash and never with food stamps. 
 I've heard people make this statement, " for that amount of money I wouldn't work! If I don't work with
 my two kids I'll get food stamps and housing." There are those who take advantage of the system, and a lot of times it's the Americans doing it. 
 "True American" are the Native American Indians. Everybody else are either immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. 
 The unique thing about America is that all the people of different origin come together and try to make it as one. Even if they have disagreements with each other when it counts, they stand as one. You could see it after Sept. 11th everybody said united we stand. It did not matter where you originated from you are an American not African-American, Asian-American, Latino-American, or European-American. America is a big melting pot and it tries to take the best part of each culture to form a united new American culture with each individual traditions and beliefs upheld.

===message:Immigration will always have an impact on America whether us as Americans feel the crunch or not. What I'm saying is our tax dollars and social security that we pay every pay period is being used to feed and house immigrants who can't afford to manage on their own. They are given the opportunity to aquire small business loans and in most cases, are tax exempt. Not every immigrant is poor but they will take the freebies given out by our government.
We are living in the best country in the world, no doubt, but are you really free? Would you rather take the FICA and Medicare payments that come out of your check every month and save or invest it in a mandatory set of options? Everytime we allow immigrants to come to into this country, it cost the government millions of dollars. Where does that money come from? Our pockets. So to make a long story short, you can't allow every immigrant to become a U.S. citizen. At times I feel invaded. There has to be more scrutiny in deciding who will be able to become an American citizen.

I have one name brand of clothing where each piece is manufactured in a different country. It's not quality, it's quantity. Even though we may be partially against immigration to the U.S. We sub-consciously purchase the goods in American stores manufactored abroad using cheap labor. We just wanna look good. Immigration isn't our only fight. How about calling customer service and getting a representative in India using a, "how to speak english manual." Go Figure.

Oller... my Dad is in the construction business, so I am familiar with the work Americans don't want to do, trust me. He has had to turn down jobs because he could not get enough workers. People give jobs to immigrnats because they will work. My Dad pays well, quite well, regardless of who you are or where you are from. We have a serious shortage of electricians, welders, etc... in this country because Ameicans generally don't want to do hard labor. As for the idea that Americans are unwilling to lower their standards, its our prices we want lowered. You see we are bargin shoppers. When we go to Walmart we want the cheapest stuff. If American manufacturing companies paid higher wages the goods would be more expensive and no one would buy them. Be realistic most people don't care where their clothes or shoes or cars were made they just want them to cost less. Very few people would be willing to pay more to garuntee jobs for people they don't know.

These are set aside for Americans with Tax Payer money. Don't get me wrong, I know immigrants work very hard, and will work on weekends, in any type of weather conditions when even the poorest American would turn down the opportunity. Immigrants will work hard for less money, but an American will look at the big picture. What about benefits? Who's paying for their Medical and Dental? Do they have life insurance? Do we treat immigrants like they are expendable. Your average American is spoiled and takes Freedom for granted. Everywhere I've lived, I see immigrants who will do the work Americans refuse to do. I don't have much of a problem with immigration, but we need to do a better job of policing the illegal aliens and monitoring those in this country on student visas who are not in school. It takes money to keep track of people, but I think we will all benefit from this in the long run.

My great grandparents came to this country looking for a better way of life for their decendents.  That is what America is about... the land of opportunity.  
I say let them come.  If they are smarter or more motivated than the current "americans" then we will simply need to motivate ourselves to compete.  
Immigrants are not given anything.  They have to work for it just like we do; and they are usually willing to work harder and longer for less pay then we are.  

As far as what will it mean to be American in the coming century, being American is a feeling of patriotism that means we are willing to defend this great country that affords us soo many opportunities.  It is being proud of the ideals that are the backbone of this country.

The fact about them coming over here getting welfare and making a life of it I agree with Mr. Byrd look at  the numbers (NO OFFENCE TO ANYONE) When I worked at a grocery store ther were WAY more african americans and caucasians on the welfare programs. Then we are talking about their jobs I commend them because just like it was stated they are doing the jobs that we wont do they will come over here and work for 3.50 and sometimes less just to make a better living for themselves but let us AMERICANS go on an interview and find out that was gonna be our salary we would leave that interview saying to our selves they don't pay enough and  rather go home and not work.

For example, take a look at the Elian Gonzalez situation. Look at how much money the citizens of America spent for he and his family to be here and take advantage of the great things our country has to offer. There are millions of Americans who go to work everyday and cannot afford to do the things for their families that we did for him. They cannot take their children to Disney World or afford to spend a night in the best hotels, yet the government will take these lower-class American's tax dollars to let this child live the high life. Don't get me wrong, I do know that this child endured much watching his mother die to make a better life for him, but is that the responsibility of us? So basically what I am trying to say is I don't think there is a problem with people wanting to have a better life by immigrating to this country,but I don't think that we should be responsible for taking care of them.
