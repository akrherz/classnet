===message:I grew up in Pennsylvania. It is certainly nothing like South Florida but I can relate to things being different. Of course the food up north is nothing like that of the south but the attitudes of people up north are nothing compared to those of Alabama. You never here "yes mam" and " no sir". Most but not all just have bad attitudes and think they are better than everyone else. They believe that people from the south are ignorant which is completely untrue.

===message:You shouldn't assume all people here do the same things. Everyone does not fit into certain areas, as you describe people here put coleslaw on their barbeque.  I have honestly never heard or saw such thing and I have spent 32 years here.  I agree we true southerners have different ways of eating certain things, but the way I was taught and the way others are taught are totally different.  The way I eat at home is different than in public, I wouldn't eat some of the things in public that would show you I have lived in the south all my life.
