===message:I think Russia is an important country. My reason is I believe that all countries are important in some way. They may not be beneficial to us but they are people just the same. I think Russia has a lot to offer and teach us. They are far from stupid and with our knowledge and their knowledge combined I think we can conquer anything.

===message:I believe that Russia is important also.  I think the Russians in the past have made us as Americans a better nation. By the US being a little intimidated by the Russians.  We have since tightened our economy and strengthen our weaknesses.  I personally still respect Russia because I believe that if someone made them upset they would strike back twice as hard one day.
