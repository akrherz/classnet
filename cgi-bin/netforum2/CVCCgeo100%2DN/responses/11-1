===message:Microcredit is an excellent concept.  Grameen bank has done an excellent job of addressing poverty.  The history of the Grameen bank speaks for its self.  They have an extremley high repayment rate and are helping those that can not help themselves.  The idea of using the village to encourage repayment was brilliant.  It seems to me it is alot like peer pressure.  If all of your neighbors were badgering you to make your payments, you would do so to avoid being cast out of the society you lived in.  This is very effective.

===message:Seems that the idea of the Grameen Bank is a good, there are several reasons why. First, this allows people who have no capital to start their own business to gain the means by which they can start the business. Secondly, this process also teaches them the responsiblity of running ones own business. 
However, there are some problems with the system, for example the pay back is higher when the money is loaned to women rather than men, now that is really odd when they live in a society where they are not equal to men in a lot of areas.

It has helped some people but others have to do something for there selves.  I think that every thing has its limits.  There is always someone out there that will abuse what they can.  I think that everyone is a winner in this situation. the people and the bankers.

===message:Microcredit appears to be working well.  The Grameen Bank not only lends money to those with no collateral to start businesses of their own, but they also espouse ways of life that will be financially beneficial to their customers.  Education combined with lending at reasonable interest rates seems to be worthwhile.  I can see this method being worthwhile in poorer areas of the U. S. as well, for example, Appalachia, where customary, traditional art work could be made by the people with help from a microcredit situation.  I don't know if it's the "answer to poverty" overall, but on a "micro" level, it's certainly a good step, it seems.  The winners are the bank, the community and individuals, and they also say that now that enough experience has passed, they see a positive effect on the national economy as a whole.  Glad to see Clinton visited and was interested in how they did things.  Can't imagine that Dubya would take an interest in that sort of humane activity.

===message:I think microcredit for the poor is a good idea, as it said in the book their pay back rate is 98%. I think it could help their country as a whole. Even the smallest amount of money can give them incentive and start they need to become self sufficient.

The fact of having a high repayment rate and being able to run their own business effectively will instil responsibility in these people. I think it has addressed poverty well. Both parties are winners. The bank gets their money and the people get the chance to make their lives better.

===message:Micro Credit seems to be the best thing that could have been introduced to the people in Bangladesh.  This is definitely the answer to poverty.  It has helped to improve the economic status of the women of this country.  Grameen has established a good policy to help the people of this country and to jumpstart the economy.   The women of Banglesh are the winners in this case.

===message:I think microcredit could be good for those who benefit from it.  I do not think it is the answer to poverty.  I mean there is a good chance you could lode the land and other things you own.  The only winers in this senario are the ones who created it.  They really can't lose anything.

===message:The Grameen Bank idea is a pretty good idea. Like one of the student said people can start their own business, but when people start their business it can teach them leadership and they will understand what ownership mean. Only thing I don't agree with is that they will end up paying more then they use. Poverty was addressed alright because the people getting their business started but how long is their business going to last. If they pay back to much money then the owners are going to raise their prices and that might cause them to loose their business.

===message:Microcredit works if it is properly managed. So far, I believe that these programs have proved themselves as an effective part of the answer.  These programs allow women to move from poverty and dependency to a new life of self-sufficiency and self-respect. This business approach to the alleviation of poverty is allowing millions of individuals to work their way out of poverty with dignity.

===message:Micro credit is cool.  I think it gives the people a chance to take risks and build their credit. The Grameen Bank gives opportunities to people no matter if they who they are. Loaning to people in small groups is a good idea and by doing this the bank would get ripped off as much.

===message:I agree here. The microcredit system does seem to be an advancement for these people. Allowing individuals to make money and be able to reinvest in their country. However not much can be reinvested if they have to pay most of it back to the system. Why is also that women are not equal to men here but their rate is so different than those of men? "male pigs" The system seems to be a foot in the right direction but needs tayloring.

===message:I think someone had to do something other than just stand by and watch their people dry up and die.  I think it's good for the moment and perhaps solve only a few of the country's problems.  If you look at this way, it doesn't sound too bad neither too good,"you can't save the world."  You do what you can and move on even though at times you are discouraged, mistreated, misused and sometimes taken advantage of.  The microcredit will never solve the poverty's problems because it's too many and too little to go around.The winners are the ones who received the profits but hey they have to live too and after all, they decided to at least help with the situation and not give up and walk away.Sure, there wil always be limits because every time there is a success, somewhere out there is a failure, but not as many.  I think this is a good way to start to repair the damages that the poor has to endure because of things beyond their control.  Idella

===message:i think that micro credit is both a good and a bad idea. it is a good idea because it allows poor people to try to better themselves and their lives. on the other hand, if one of the members of the group doesn't pay their share of a loan, then none of the other members can ever get another loan. in ways, both the poor people and the Grameen Bank benefit from this system. theres no clear cut solution to poverty. as long as there are people who are rich and people who are poor there will always be poverty. even in the u.s. theres poverty. the grameen bank has certainly helped but not done away with all of it.

===message:I think this idea like many has its pros and cons.  In a sense, it is a road out of poverty. It gives a sense of hope that might not have existed previously.  However, the problem does arise with the group formation. If one member of the group does not hold up theie end of the bargain, then the entire group must suffer.  The greatest benefit of the microcredit system has to be its influence on the lives of women which also supports the entire community.

===message:I think microcredit is a good thing ,I like the multiplier effect has on the  comunity ,if women get the loan.Anything that inproves nutrition,health care and education for the poorest people is good.The 98percent payback rate is a great succes,a lot of banks in the U.S.most likly are not that lucky with all the loan defaults happening.The group pressure works there good .I do not think that would work every were,because not all societies are the same.I believe it helps ,but I don't think it is an answer to poverty.It might be a start a small drop in a bucket,it takes in most poor countrys more then microcredits to get rid of poverty.
Less violent conficts,no corruption,large scale education....

===message:I think that microcredit is a wonderful idea. I wish we had something like that over here. The only people that can borrow money here is people with good credit. At least the bank gives people who aren't qulified for normal loans a chance to get money which helps those women take care of things that could mean life or death.

===message:I think that micro credit is a good idea. As long as the people that borrow the money continue to pay it back everyone will win. The country will have less people starving to death and more people baying taxes. The lender gets to make a little bit of interest so they have even more money to lend, and the citizens get the chance to become productive citizens. Micro credit will probably not stop poverty by itself but at least it can help some.I think the country also needs to work on their education. If you give someone money and they do not have the ability to use it wisely the money will go to waste. If this people had some amount of education to go with their money they would probably invest it even better than they already are.

===message:It is hard for me to say is it is a good idea or not. I understand that they are loaning money to poor people who have no collateral, etc. However, I was concerned about them lumping them into groups so that if one person messes up everyone loses. The exorbitant interest rates leads one to feel that the poor are further being taken advantage of. However, considering that they have little other opportuinty I guess it is better than nothing. I find it intersting that woman make the most positive use of the money.

I feel that it hass addressed some of the povery issues due to the fact that more people are moving out of poverty and trying to make a living for themselves. the only disadvantage to this microcredit is that the payback rates are higher for women.Grameen has done a part to address the povery issue but this is only a start. I think that overall both parties are the winners with microcredit.
