===message:I have stood by and watched as Hispanics and other foreigners forged on our country and most of them succeed faster than we do.  I'm not saying that they don't have a right to the blessings that our country offer to many but it appears that they hate our guts.  It's as if they want to take over and put us out.  I agree that they work hard for what they want to achieve, they stick together until all of them are successful.  This could teach us lazy Americans to work harder for what is already ours.  But all we do is complain and fight and they quietly sit back and wait for the kill. Statistics is proving that they, mostly Hispanics are the largest minority now.  They are every where in the United States.  They are getting involved with all races of our females and literally giving us the men we need in place  of the ones that are incarcerated and they have no shame about it.  African Americans men are populating the prison system as the sun rise and shine.  We don't appreciate working hard anymore and certainly not for small wages but the foreigners understand what it means to earn a dollar.  As the saying goes, "it's not how much money you make, it's how much you spend."  We, Americans have got to take a good look at ourselves and start putting time and effort back into our heart, family and our community.  We are after a fast dollar and if we failed to get it quick, we turn to criminal acts as if we should take what was never ours.  It's also true that there aren't any free meal tickets.  Soon our country will be populated with Hispanics, Asians or any on-looker that want to achieve a better life.  Frankly, I think we as a whole waste entirely too much money and we stick our noses into situations that we should ignore and don't  take care of our own first.  We talk too much.  Why can't we just blow our enemy away and then describe it later using only enough details to let the world know that we are not to be messed with.  But with technology the way it is today, they know before we blow and are setting ready to knock us out.  The country failed when it allowed all these foreigners to come in and work for us.  They are here and we can't find them or know how to get rid of them.  They should make me President for a month and I'll change some of this stuff that we do.  We are never satisfied with well-enough.  Although, some of them are good, hard-working citizens and appreciate being a part of our culture, what about the ones who are here because of hate and don't give a bull's eye about popping a bullet in your head.  We have created our worst nightmare because we wanted to be kind to other countries and we are still creating more by not eliminating what we should have done long-ago.  We have too many and somebody needs to go.  It looks as though we are the ones who are going to have to leave.    Idella Johnson

===message:First of all, I think that you should sit back and really read your "statement". How do you expect anyone to try to live peacefully with one another when you spout such hateful junk??  You know, the Lord says that we are to all love one another as he loves us.  I hate to burst your bubble, but that means the Mexicans too.  Sure, maybe they are overpopulating and getting most of the free jobs but that is because most American men( as you said) will not go out and take those jobs back themselves.. However, I don't feel the answer is to hate them.  They are people with souls and feelings too, and I'm sure if you approach them with such hate in your heart, no matter what you try to say to them it will make no difference. They will be that more determined to take your job because you have done them that way.  Wouldn't you?  I am 100% American, and don't get me wrong.. I want our people to have the jobs first.. But I don't think that we should mistreat anyone in the process. I feel that there needs to be a cut made in the amount of minorities that are allowed in our country, and to the remaining.. I feel that if they are to live here, then the money they make in this country should be made to stay here.. They should have to pay the same taxes that we do, if they are going to send their money back home, then they should have to pay a steep luxury tax to do so.
