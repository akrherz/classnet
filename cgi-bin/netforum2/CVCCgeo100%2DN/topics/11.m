===message:The information that I read was interesting and helpful. I think that the this bank was very useful to those people. I think that it was a good idea and it help some people out of poverty and help there families do better. I am glad that there are more resources to get out of poverty in the United States. Maybe if more people get on the band wagon and will borrow money to help themselves out or maybe several of them can get together and borrow as a team. This will cause them to sacrifice and do better as a whole. And maybe this could pave the way to changes in that country.

===message:I think the microcredit idea is a good way to help poor people obtain money. Not only are they having to pay the interest they are helping themselves at the same time by openig up there own business and making there own money. Like it said in the book if the city in a whole is having money problems this would probably be a good way for them to try to get back on their feet.

===message:I think Micro credit is an excellent idea for the poor. It doesn't require much of a start up cost for people to start up a business so the small amounts borrowed are easier to pay back. The interest rates are kept at a reasonable rate of 13 to 14% per year. It also ensures networking between business men, and allows women the chance to communicate with other women and men which under normal circumstances,  would not be allowed. It may not be the answer to poverty but Micro Loans have to give some glimpes of hope. It has helped tremendously and is being closely observed by neighboring countries. The book doesn't state whether or not the loans have limits but it does state that the money could be used for start up cost rather than financing the entire business. I feel the Grameen Bank has taken a major step in addressing poverty by taking the risk of loaning to the poor. The winners in this senerio are the bank and poor. The bank is growing at a steady rate from the money made in interest. The poor are given a second chance in life.

===message:I feel Microcredit is a very beneficial program for the people of Banglesh. The program gives the people a chance to start somewhere. True enough they may or may not be successful but at least they have the chance. Grameen has addressed poverty fairly well because Microcredit has helped. It has helped to develop a positive status in the economy for women. I do think women are the winners in this senario.
