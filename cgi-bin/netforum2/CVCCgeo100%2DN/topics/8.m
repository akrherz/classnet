===subject:Is Russia Important? 
===message:Russia is still important in that recently it has gained international interest in regard to its potential oil and gas wealth. Russia is also slowly moving into a capitalist economy, which would benefit the entire region that has been recently declining in growth and social status.

===message:Yes, Russia is an important country with useful resources that are valuable to the United States. Russia has great agricultural land. People from Russia seem to be very smart and can come up with many ideas. I feel Russia is important also because they not our enemies. We've done all the hating; it is time for us all to come together.

===message:I believe that in some way or another every country is important just like every person is important.  But if whether we benefit from them or not means they are important then no they are not.  We don't benefit from them other than them being on our side but they don't even really have a military.

===subject:Is Russia Important?
===message:I think Russia is important for those who live in the country. Even though poverty, alcoholism and low life expectancy plagues the country, the citizens all want to work, and are patient to wait on their big opportunity in life. The country has  a lot of regrouping and political rebuilding to achieve the same level of importance they had in the early 80's. Russia is worth keeping an eye on for the next 1-2 decades. If no major changes occur during that time, the United States may be asked to step in. Then will be the time to really ask yourself, is Russia worth a few of your hard earned tax dollars?

===subject:Russia is Important
===message:I do believe Russia is important to its citizens. To them it is all they know, therefore how it it governed and the choices that are made affects every aspect of their live. Not only is Russia important to its citizens, but it should be important to Americans as well. There are many natural resources and that come from Russia that we Americans depend on. If it were not for Russia and its people who work so hard daily, we may have to work harder for some of the things that we take for granted.  In my opinion, anywhere that there is people is important.

===message:I do belive that Russia is important. They have not always made the right decisions. Also there leaders have not faced them in the right direction, many were to selfish. They have beautiful landforms and sites. As long as they keep their weapons under control I am ok.

===message:Russia is important to whoever resides there. I don't care to vist or live there. But it would probable devaste my life because of the freedom and all the things that I am accustomed to. I would be like a new born baby there no know what to do next and someone always have to hold my hand. Life is sometimes hard enough without the many struggle that we have to overcome in the United States. I think Russia is important to those who live there.
