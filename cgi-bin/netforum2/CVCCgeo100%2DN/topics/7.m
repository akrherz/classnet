===subject:Europe some more
===message:The major states of Western Europe seem to be coming closer together in the EU, but within their own boundries some of these nations are struggling to maintain control of ethnic minorites or nationalities, which are seeking some level of autonomy. There are many questions for Euorpe's political future. Will there be a United States of Europe? Will the large influx of outside immigrants drown the complaints of a handfull of Scots or Basque? Will Europe continue its current trend with countries breaking down into smaller states (see Yugoslavia)? Will Scotland ever achieve..."FREEDOM!!!!" (Braveheart joke)

===message:It feel that there will one day be a United States of Europe. I lived in Germany for 3 years from 1983 to 1986. Everything East of Germany was considered enemy to include the Czech Republic which is now a member of NATO. This goes to show that people in general want to unite. It takes leaders that are willing to look at the big picture and look at what is in the best interest of their citizens. It may take upwards of 50 or more years to Unite but it will happen. Once you get all countries on one sheet of music, these countries begin to flourish. People will have more choices on where they want to live and work. They will be able to spend one currency throughout Europe. I know what it is like to watch the exchange rate daily for the value of the dollar to the German Mark. Every country you visited, you had to buy their currency. It was very mind boggling.
By uniting it will cause immigration and it will drown the complaints of a few. I feel that Europe will continue its trend of breaking down into smaller states.

===message:I do not believe there will be a US of Europe, but close to it. The economy is already growing and catching up with time. The women are gaining more freedom, and it never crossed my mind that there was a country that didn't allow women all of their freedom like me. If the country would help more there wouldn't be as many immigrants. I mean, the US does set a great example, and all countries should be common on some type ground. Of course, i think Scotland will achieve freedom simply because others parts of the country are becoming more free and some with power will make Scotland that way. Free is the way to be.

===message:Europe has come a long way as far as development. Although a "United States of Europe" would be a great idea, it is at the time unrealistic. Cultures ans social norms do vary amoung the small states and will be almost impossible to merge. A change may be positive for Europe. Yet, if a change is not seen as a drastic need,it will not take effect any time in the near future.
