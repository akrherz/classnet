===message:I believe that Africa has not caused a threat to America yet, besides HIV/AIDS. They have been in the news for that. America is sometimes a stingy country. We only help people out that are helping us, well at least in this situation. Maybe I am wrong.

===message:With all the Caos going with our country, there isn't any time to focus on other countries. Besides, it's not like they have someone over their that is a threat to the US, and our way of life. The US has to have assurance that it is safe. I believe once that is accomplished, Assistance and media coverage may take place in Congo.

===message:Everyone attention is on the United States,it is always somthing going on in the United States.THat is why Africa is not the main story going on.I agree with my classmates.United States value life,so if it was that many people who died,it would of been a issue.It would still be heard of today.Countries overseas seems not to value life of their people,so it is believe not to be important enough to mention more.

===message:The situation in Africa is saddening. It is much like other regions of the world that is stricken with poverty and no signs of progress. I believe that the weathly nations all over the world should bond together in order to help many of the other countries that need assistance. The U.S. has done its part over the years. We cannot save the entire world alone. By bonding together to restore hope and life to suffering countries the entire world will be a desirable place to live as oppose to a small number of wealthy nations.

===message:My opion is that due to the tragic ways of the world today; Africa does not impose a threat to the Untied States. As for, Sirdam in Bagdad, whom imposes a serious threat to the U.S.; who has the whole world foucs on war. Due to the fact that we are at risk of being destoryed by atomic weapons an which Africa does not have. So Africa is not a focus of the world at this time.

===message:I guess that what is going on over there is not important to the media in the United States. Only about AIDS and how it is effecting those in that country.I really don't hear about the how hunger has been overwelhming in that country.I guess whatever is important to the media justifable to the media.
