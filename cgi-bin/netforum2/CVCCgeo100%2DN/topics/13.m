===message:China is known for the things they produce for the United States. Everywhere you look everything is made in China. The wages that are made in that country is not up to par. You have power when you have unity. We have so many immigrants of that country over here working and going to school. I guess our conditions are better. I don't think that they will be next have what call power.

===message:I believe that China has the ability to become a leader. They certainly have the population to take over. If someone would step up and everyone would follow, not exactly a dictatorship. The United States should back them and not make them mad, because they are a sleeping giant.

===message:I can't see China as the next Superpower because of the environmental issues they have. They are very smart people and they care for each other but until they change some of their rules toward women, they will never be a superpower.

===message:China is a country very affluent in techonolgy and production. Their government may not be as equal as ours, but it is effective. There are areas of improvement needed in sanitation, and population control. This country is the home of many great leaders and I can see it's opportunity in becoming the next great-power a great possibility.

===message:I believe that China is sizing down a little bit. I feel it will be on of the stonger countries in the near future.Sometimes it is best to work in smaller groups than larger ones.That is what China is trying to accomplish with the PLA.They believe in helping their on people and feeding them,that for one will help htem grow and be stronger.
