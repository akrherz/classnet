===message:Why does Europe need immigrants? Why do they oppose immigration? Is it racism? Is it Nationalism? Ignorance? Fear? What does it mean to be "French" or German" or "English"? Are those identities as flexible as "American"?

===message:America sounds a lot like Europe when it comes to immigration. There are pros as well as cons. Europe was in a crisis needing more workers. At the time the guest workers helped out. The bad part of it was when they wanted to stay, Europe didnt want them to be apart of their country.I guess European people felt as though they would take over, they were already doing the jobs that no one else wanted.In today society, we as America have a very similiar problem, But want is so crazy, we as American send our factories over seas just to get a cheaper product(paying cheaper wages) this in return cost America a lot of jobs.

===message:I think Europe is like America when it comes to immigration. I dont think its so much nationalism as it is racism,ignorance,or fear. Fear that the Amercians or other immigrants will move into the country and take over the jobs that the europeans might be needing or wanting. Also I believe there is some racism and ignorance invovled, just like other races its the same priniciple its just the fear of the unknown someone new and different living in your country and becoming acustomed to your life style. At the same time Europe needs immigrants just like we do, for jobs, military positions, and so on.

===message:Europe needs immigrants to meet the future and current economic needs in the workforce.  Seems like Europeans have forgotten that immigrants helped, in 1990, to keep their economy afloat.  In the European country it is not easy to acquire citizenship.  France openly talks about driving out immigrants.  To be an American citizen is so much easier, I feel like Americans accept immigrants much more than the other countries.  We also appreciate them alot more.  Europe's economy is thriving now but as soon as they start to suffer, they will once again be begging for immigrants.

===message:Europe doesn't want immigrants in their country because they feel they are taking jobs away from their citizens.  They don't mind them earning a nest egg and moving on but the immigrants wants to stay and enjoy the money and country because they see no reasons for returning to their homeland.  No, I don't think it's racism, I think they like to be around their own people and don't want their families mixing with all that different blood.  They know that if they stay long enough they will start to take over the culture and get involved in relationships that they don 't want to see happen.  It's just like the Mexican dominating the USA.  It's a mess, you have all kind of crimes, bi-racial children and we had enough problems before they started to invade the country.  Not much this time, I have been sick.  Idella Johnson

===message:I think that the Europeans do need need immigrants first because there are a lot of jobs that these immigrants leave their homelands to make a honest living to do that most europeans feel that they are to good to do. I feel that europeans have the same attitude as Americans when it comes to the immigrants we dont want them over here but there are jobs out here that needs to be done yet in still we wont perform them. but when they come over here to perform them there is a problem. If it were not for many of these immigrants some of the luxuaries that the americans and Europe heve today wouldnt be posssible. Like going out to eat. The people that are opposed to immigrants are both fearful and ignorant. They are fearful that that they will take something from them but they are ignorant to the fact that they can also add something to their lives. In the long run for the economy to run both here and in Europe efficiently and smoothly immigrants will have to been seen as a help not a hinder to the economy.

===message: I think that Europe needs immigrant because they are not reproducing in that country. The more we reproduce it is likely that there will be someone to take your place for number of reasons. The world is still revolving and the changing everyday. I don't think immigration is wrong at this point because they need people to carry on. But on the other hand in the United States. We have jobs and people to filled the demands of these jobs. But when the immigrant come over and work for less. This makes it easier for Americans not to have a job. I think the immigrant should go to Europe and find work.

===message:I don’t believe that immigration is extremely vital in Europe’s future for economic growth (or any type of growth).  It seems as though Europe is reluctant to do the jobs that they now need immigrants to do.  What’s wrong with training the unemployed and underemployed?  Yes, Europe has a problem with the aging population, but I think they see immigration only as a delay in the problem.  It’s hardly a solution.  I think they might also rebuke the idea, not because of hatred or prejudices, but because they link immigration to rising crime rates.

===message:Europe definately needs the immigrants just to sustain some kind of support for the aging community. I think that they oppose it because they see such a difference between themselves and the immigrants and they want to preserve what they have now, but times change whether you like it or not. I think it is a form of rasicm, nationalism, and ignorance. How different are their views from those of Hitler? Maybe he is an extreme example, but after all he was trying to preserve a "pure" race. I think they have much more to benefit than to lose by allowing the immigration.

Maybe now might not be a great time, with 9/11, but Europe should not wait until they are completly down to do something about it. Just because America is the land of the free, does not mean we are the only ones who should accept immigrants into our society. It sure help out Europe in 1990 when their society was collapsing.

===message:Euorpe and other countries do not need immigrants.  I feel that Europe is looking for a easy way out of hard work.  They hirer all these immigrants to work for half of what they would pay their own people.  Allowing the immigrants into Europe there will be less space and more confusion, but the construction and eletrician workers will make more money.  I believe they oppose immigration because of fear that the immigrants probably end up taking over their jobs and the life what they call home.

===subject:Europe/Immigrants
===message:Europe needs immigrants because they played a vital role as fill-ins during the 1960's to help rebuild. They were invited to Europe to earn a nest egg and go home, however life was better for immigrants in Europe, so they were able to live somewhat comfortably and send money back to their parents. This is where the opposition comes in. Now you have invited guess that are not willing to leave. There could be a hint of racism but some of the main issues facing Europeans are loss of jobs for less expensive labor, mixing of races according to right-wing parties. The bottom line is Europe has to look at the situation as something they brought on themselves. If you invite immigrants into your country and they find out the grass is greaner on the other side of the fence, they deserve to stay. It is ignorant to attempt to push immigrants out of the country after they help rebuild the country. The fear part of it is Europe never will know which one or two of those immigrants might rise up and become a strong political figure. I do think it is a good idea to regulate closely who becomes a citizen and who does not. Hind sight being 20/20, Germany makes it extremely difficult to become a citizen, which will give them time to reevaluate the services of immigrants already there.

===message:I don't think Europe needs immigrants;(because it's people can do the work) they are just taking advantage of the fact that immigrants are desperate and will work for a lot less than the people of Europe would. I assume that immigration is being opposed because the fear of immigrants becoming wiser. For example, Immigrants start opening their own businesses, working for themselves, distributing their products, and making a profit for themselves. It probably would start total caos. Personally, I feel if someone wants to work( no matter the situation) that person should be considered and treated as anyone in any country.
