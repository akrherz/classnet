I believe that intervention is a good thing and that the East Timor was done for the right reasons. Intervention should be used globally, but the UN should watch over it to make sure it stays for the right reasons.

===message:The outside intervention is a good thing for the situation with Timor.  I feel it help the people in Timor, because the so call freedom they suposed to had was no more than sending them to the grave.  Even if the UN are supervising that would not stop the people from being starved or murder.

===message:I think outside intervention is a good thing if the problem can't be resolved from within. The invasion of East Timor was done for the right reasons.  People should be treated as people.  I think intervention should be truly global.  UN and NATO should supervise and when one is needed in a particular situation the appropriate org. should reply.

===message:For the benefit of the people I think that intervention should be in effect and let be known that the people of that country really matters no matter what the situation is about. I think that intervention should be done globaly because you have rulers that ruler a particular country and they don't care about what is right for the people and feed off their own selfish motives. You have some people that don't have a heart and wish to do as they please to people. I don't care what country it is the people opinion has a whole is what matters that's why we vote. I am proud to an American and thank God for the freedom that has came forth after all the slavery back in the past years. In a sense the UN and NATO should be supervised because they do things for there own selfish reasons and that is what we want to deteriate for happening.
