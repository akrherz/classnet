===message:I believe that in every country their are many different perspectives in the ways of living. Many countries would think that are cuss words were nothing more than a hello. Some even use are cuss words as a normal every day word. Even certain gestures with your hands could offend a person in a different country. I do agree that people have their own memory an opinion on countries. Some live in terrible conditions but don't know anything else so it's not that bad to them. I could not think of a better country than ours, but I think that has a lot to do with the fact that I have lived here all my life. There are still issues in our country that I think are unjust but are fair other countries. Everybody has a different opinion but I think that it boils down to how they are used to living in the way they relate to other countries.

===message:Imagenary Homeland is true,every person sees a place different ,even the same person sees a place different if they have been there in different stages in there life.What is interesting to a child looks later different to an adult.My hometown Bremerhaven in Germany was for some people the gate to a new world(Bremerhaven to Ellis Island ,NY with a boat).Some see it just us a place to ship their car back to the states.For me it is home,my kids see it as an exciting place,to see things I told them about.
And the place their grandparents and family lives.

===message:In reading the article imaginary homelands the first thing that popped into my head is my own situation. I am from Detroit Michigan and I have been residing an Auburn well Alabama since 1996 and I am very comfortable here as when I go home due to the changes in the lifestyles I feel out of place sometime. but then I'll ask some of my family members about their experiences down here and they say thing like we are slow and we talk country and they were frightned by the people like when your walking by and people that you dont know speak. I have to tell them that is just politeness whereas in Detroit you could get killed for soeaking to the wrong person. then they say that from their experience they dont see how I could live here. they complain about it being too hot but yet too cold in Detroit MAKE UP YOUR MIND!!! I've said all this to say I do believe things are inportant the way you percieve them and the biggest challenge of all is experiencing them. when I was younger if some one had told me that I would end up living here I probaly would've had the same views as my family based on one visit here but now that I live her it is very much diferent than what I percieved earlier.

===message:While reading the discussion for this week, I realized how different we are. Many of you have been so many places. However, I have always lived within a 150 miles radius of Phenix City. But I have lived both in the city as well as the country. I prefer the country, it is a safe place to raise children, less pollution, and no killings. Many see the country as being just to far of a drive, and to quite.

===message:As I read the text for this week I realized that there are different types of people. I have never gave it much thought because I have live all over the world. When I moved to a different place I just changed my ways to fit thiers. I never thought anything about it because that was the way I was raised. I was raised to respect the believes of others. I traveled since I was one years old I never thought to question others.

===message:The only place I can think of that I have seen and viewed differently then other people is the fair. I traveled with the fair until I had my first daughter. When I traveled with the fair it was like my family. It was a way to support myself and a way of life. I did not feel the excitment that other people felt when they got there. Even today when I go to the fair I do not get excited. Most people go to the fair and see  cotton candy, rides, and games. When I go to the fair I still see a way of life.I notice if the rides have been cleaned or if any light bulbs are missing.When me and my friend went to the fair last year she looked like a kid the day before Christmas. I could have cared less if I was there or not. My friend and I live in the same town, have similiar jobs, and interest, but when we went to the fair we saw it like it was two different worlds. We were in the same place, but we had totally different views.

===message:It is very strange to go back and visit the place you grew up in. When you were young you thought this place was great but as you get older you view things much different. I grew up in a small farm town.(25 kids in my class)We were either farmer kids or truckdriver kids. I lived there until the end of my junior year. Each time I go back and visit I think what did I see in this dead town with nothing but fields and farms.(I joke with my husband and say I live in the white two-story house on the left)Every house is white and most of them are two-story farmhouses in the middle of big open fields. How dull and ugly. I wonder what do these kids now do for fun. It is the most dreadful place to visit. No wonder we use to have keg parties all the time. There was nothing else to do. My husband has a different point of view. He still sees great farmland and always calling his dad to see how the crops are. Yes he was a farm kid and I was a trucker kid. How can one area of our country not change much at all while other areas grow in vast leaps and bounds. I know the economy has a lot to do with it but even so how can a place that I onced loved and had a lot of great times growing up turn into what I now call a dead town. My sisters tell me oh it's still the same only alittle smaller. I disagree! I know I would not want my children groing up there now because all they could do is get in trouble. Am I just getting old and my ways have changed or can your hometown really change in a way that is so negative? I wonder if I left Georgia now and came back several years later would I think the same. On the plus side of my little hometown. The last time I visited I actually saw minorites in the town. When I grew up there was nothing but white people. Maybe the little town is getting alittle cutural to it.

===message:I posted a message before but I don't see my name. I talked about my perspective of Germany then and now. When I was there, you could trust your neighbor and the children loved Americans. I recall giving a young kid money to go to the store for me. Upon his return my military unit was leaving. This kid rode his bike frantically trying to catch me to give me my goods and the change. It looked as though he was crying. Nowadays, I was told that you couldn't trust everyone because of the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. Imagine that. It had to be like opening up a prison and letting the inmates run free. You can't trust like I'm used to. I'm sure there are still parts of the country that were left untouched and trust is still the watchword. Yet other parts of Germany watch as crime began to sore. My perspective of Germany is different now and I would really watch what is going on around me if I went back today.
