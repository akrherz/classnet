===message:What is motivating the Palestinians and the Israelis? How does each side present its case? As we have seen with Al Jezeera coverage of the Iraq war, media coverage (often biased or heavily spun) can have a huge impact on the way outsiders view an event. Who is winning the media "spinning" of the Arab-Israeli conflict? Why?

===message:Each side wants to be in power.  I feel that neither side does not know what they want either peace or war.  If the media show the truth of what is going on it is not going to help; but it will bring more people into the problem.

===message:This is a difficult topic. I believe the media is causing a problem, their is too much information going around. This war is just a power struggle. Bush is finishing what his dad should have finished. In some ways it is ok to know what is going on, but not to see actuale deaths happening. Think if you were a kid growing up to something like this. I also believe this war is going to have high casualities on both sides, but the media does not need to advertise that.

===message:Fear and ignorance is the key motivation for the conflicts between the Arabs and Israel.  All they are doing is trying to keep themselves alive and just strike out at whoever they think is a threat.  They don't know any other way to act.

===message:I believe all of the conflict is over which country has the most power. The media's "spinning" is booming because of the live coverage that is available.
