===message:Today's levels of immigration are similar to the massive levels that brought the vast numbers of Irish, Germans, Italians, and Eastern Europeans in the later half of 19th century and the first decade of the 20th. How will this latest wave of immigrants effect our country? What will it mean to be American in the coming century?

===message:It seems as if the area in which I live in has become more populated with spanish speaking people. It has really been an adjustment at my work place, communcations are very hard.  In the past, my attitude was " If they want to be here in the U.S. at least learn the language." But since I have change my attitude. Who would'nt want FREEDOM. We as Americans are so blessed to be here in this great land.I know there has to be a line drawn of how many can move here. But I also feel that they should have to earn their education and living as we do. As long as we Americans stick together and support our values as a nation, than America will always be the GREATEST.

===message:I dont think there will be an all American person living here in America. So many people come into our country every day and start there lives here. I think its good for the economy in some way because it gives us a helping hand in things, but also it takes away some job offers from others. I am not opposed to immigration, just maybe it should be downsized alittle.

===message:I think immigration will have more of a negative affect on the USA. I say this because I don't believe those people care about us, only what we can do for them. I believe in helping people, but when you have a country where some of its own people are helpless and homeless, how are you going to help ones who aren't from this country. I mean, if some of us was to visit over there, we may get hurt. I just think the USA should just help their economy and government get it together and let their people stay there and live comfortable.

===message:This is an argument that has been going on for a very long time. I think most Americans response to this is a reaction based on fear. The fear is losing ones way of life. This country has been built on emmigration. Ultimately, I think diversity makes us stronger. I am not inclined to believe the rumor that immigrants just want to come here and much of the system. It takes a highly motivated person to leave their home and come here and start fresh dealing with a differnt culture and language. I think we have to be careful to not fall into "the haves and the have nots". Most Americans want to be sure to protect what they have at the expense of the pursuit of freedom and opportunity of others. There is also the argument that we cannot even take care of our own so why should we help others.Let's face it...we can take care of our own but simply allow people to fall through the cracks. WE have plenty of resources but how are they utilized. I am sure alot of funds go to gov't programs that many would consider not beneficial for most people. Ultimately, diversity is our strength.

===message:Most immigrants contribute more to the U.S. economy than they cost.  Some pay taxes like most of the U.S. Most immigrants work harder than most Americans and for less pay.  Americans in the coming century shouldn't be worried about their jobs and benefits.  I think immigrants are not a problem because the person, regardless of who they are immigrant or not must have the better qualifications for whatever the task.

===message:All of our ancestors came from some where else.  So I believe each country together makes up america.  I think the amount of immigrants should be watched though.  We have our own business that we need to take care of.  That is their homeland and we can't make things right there.  It's like asking for world peace.

===message:

 I believe that immigrantes should be allowed to live here because we as Americans preach that we are a free country, but stop people from third world countries from coming here. That does not make much sense. I think it should be regulated to some extent, but as long as immigrantes abide by our laws and help support this country, then they have just as much right as Americans as we do.

===message:Our country is on the verge of a rampant, out-of-control population growth.  We can’t protect our environment with such a growth.  Our cities will no longer be livable and we will no longer be a truly United States.  Many think that the U.S. needs the supply of cheap, hard-working immigrants to insure future prosperity.  If this is so, more that 60% of our population growth in the next century will come from our immigration policy and it will be only a matter of time before the U.S. population surpasses that of India and China.  
I don't know where it is we are going, but I know that the direction our country is headed in is the wrong one.  Money is motivation.  We think on individualistic terms...there's no more teamwork.  As a hole, no one cares about the man next door anymore.  We need to refocus on who we are, why we are here.  I wish we could just shut the doors to our country for a while. To those that want in - "No you can't have it, it's ours."

Loans and as for as foodstamps are made ready for them.When we as Americans have to wait from month to month to even recieve service. And many of them work and send the money back home. Some businesses are already across seas and that have cut the jobs for Americans.

===message:You know, the topic of immigration has become such a touchy subject due to the fact of our most recent terrorist attacks and such.  We here in America have always been welcoming to people from other countries. Our country is made up of massive amounts of people from all different kinds of culture.  The Polish, and German gave us all different kinds of culture (polka dancing), and weiner snitzle.. :).. Now, the Mexicans are becoming more and more predominant and that is ok too.  However, I do feel that they should limit the amount that are allowed to become citizens.  If we do not, because of all of our wonderful freedoms here we could become more "Mexican" than "American".. I feel that all should be welcome.  We all deserve the best opportunity to make something of ourselves.. However within reason.  In the next 50 years, maybe Tamales, and Chimichangas, and Latino Music will become as regularly known as Bratwursts, and Polka dancing.. Who knows?  Look at JLo... :)And thats a good thing of course :)

===message:    When I began to read that article, many things came to mind. The first thing I thought about was my home town. How there is a change there. The population of the Mexican has grown. I've also realize the times I traveled ,I see more immigrants. They are becoming more useful everyday. They work for less money in some places and for that reason alone, more employers are using them. They buget their money very well. They believe in sharing and looking out for each other. There is a growing number of immigrants from Africa. Most of those immigrants from Africa and Asia are very educated, so there are replacing Americans in the Schools and colleges. There is very much "Change of Faces in America". I feel as if it will change even more in the next decade.

===message:Yes, there is a lot of immiration to America but I see more of the uneducated than educated.  I see the immigrants that "hang out" around smaller convenience stores to buy their beer, etc.  I see the ones that work for less than min. wage and live 10+ to a house.  I also see the ones that treat Wal Mart shopping as if it is a once in a lifetime event.  This single outing buys more buy than I ever drank in my entire lifetime. I also see how they treat the women they are with, like property instead of a human. I think they should have a time limit to get a job and a place to live. I think they should have to verify that they are continually holding down a job or enrolled in school.  That would better their relatives they have back in their homelands.  I also feel we should limitthe number allowed over, we should set a quota (ex. 1000 per year from Asia, Africa... and so on).
