===message:I feel as though the owner of the Maquiladoras are the only winners. The people who work in the factories are cheated in wages and in protection from dangers in the workplace. However, the Americans can enjoy low prices on the products. Many Americans have lost thier jobs to these factories. The American enomony has suffered. I see the owners trying to make to the top of the ladder no matter who it hurts, thier country included.

===message:The people that benefit from maquiladoras is the ones that own the company.  Because we (the U.S.) doesn't get anything out of it.  One negative is the Mexican people having to do without jobs due to getting cut.  The need the money and food to have for their families. We don't like immigration but how else are they going to be able to live and survive if they are no jobs for them to keep up with.  A positive is that there are a few jobs that allow them to work and make pennies an hour to atleast help buy things for there family to survive on.

===message:I think that the only people that benefit from the maquiladoras is the people who own these factories. The only positive that comes out of this is a large of amount of goods with low labor cost. But then again that is not really a positive because the people who are laboring in these factories are getting no benefits and very little pay. So at the same time other countries including ourselves here in America, are gaining from this, the other people who are working in these conditions are not.

===message:There are two views to every thing.  To this story there are good and bad things happening.  To the mexicans it is great they have jobs, but on the other hand they are working for basicly nothing.  The business side of this is just coming out great.  The payroll is down and the prices are up.  For the americans that worked in these factories  are losing their jobs and loosing pay.  The americans that buy these products are not loosing or making money.

===message:The U.S. and anyone else who buys these imported goods made by Mexicans are the benefactors.  A positive thing about this system is that the U.S. benefits because Americans get to spend their time and money on other things instead of something like a maquiladora program.  A definite negative point about this system is that Mexicans get paid so little and work so much.

===message:I believe it's ashame that as far as we have advanced in our society, we, as Americans, the richest counrty in the world still believe that "everyone shouldn't earn a decent living."  No matter how much we have or how much we earn, we, and I mean some of us feel the poor should just die or continue to work like a slave.  The major corporations found a way to save money, cut insurance benefits, and retirement priviledges by saying, "we have someone who will do the damn work for cents and won't complain because they need to stay alive."  Working in those foreign plants is worse than being on "welfare."  No one believe any more that there are no free meal tickets.  Every thing you want or choose to work for is going to cost you something even if it's just your precious time.  Why would any one who believe in good food, excellent health, saving for the future treat individuals like this for a dollar.  Perhaps, this is why so many other countries hate the United States because they are just damn right crazy at times.  It pays in the long run just to treat everyone right and in the end justice will prevail.  But what do we care long as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  I guess like the old saying goes, "it's hard, but it's fair."  Our nation has been blessed because we care about bad things happening to others but on other issues at hand, we are underminding people who doesn't have a choice but to go along with whatever they have to in order to survive.  I ask myself sometimes, why do they pay individuals such as athletes, politicians, actors/actress, singers, presidents all that money?  I know that a person can live more than comfortable with a salary of less than 100,000.00 a year.  Hey, we do it every day.  The people who live on small minimum wages and no benefits.  Why is greed at the top of the big dog list?  Shouldn't we at this time, try to understand that the world is not our for the asking but we will leave it behind for others who will enjoy all the riches that is allowed.  I believe that human beings feel that have the  power to control the entire universe.  Look at what happen to the space shuttle, Colombia.  It came down because maybe someone is trying to tell us to leave what God has made alone and take care of our society.  Perhaps we should take better care of the elderly, feed the hungry children, provide medical care to all, put up some shelters for the homeless, pay the people who does the labor enough funds to live in a safe and clean environment.  Besides, who in the h--- wants to visit the moon or plan to live there.  Surely, not I.  I plan to stay on the ground as low as I can and that's about it for me.  I think they should ban all those mexicans from coming to the USA and pay them to enjoy their country.  They can do that if Bush stop drinking and realize that he can make a difference instead of trying to fight.  What's wrong with him?  It's time for us to talk, not fight.   Idella

===message:The only people that really benefit are the businesses.  A business is all about trying to find the cheapest way to make money.  It doesn't matter who else benifits or who is hurt as long as their products sell and they make money. I don't believe it is right though for the mexican labors to work so much and get paid so little.   I believe the NAFTA law is still in act because us americans just keep our eyes closed to the facts and just see the price of the products.

===message:Personally I think the benifits goes to the businesses because they can get their work done from these people for a little or nothing. Even though the people come and do a hard days work they dont get paid enough. It also can be seen as a benifit o these workers because no matter how little the money is they are still maknig some they have to live by the theory that some money is better than none. I think the negative side is as I stated earlier the low paying of the jobs. Also another negative side is there wont be enough jobs to go around and the men are less likely to get work at these facilities also.

Definatly on a negaitive side people( Mexican or not) should not be treated this way, everyone should have to same opportunity to make money.

===message:I've worked with a number of Mexicans and the situations they told me they had to go through were very cruel. They actually described coming to the USA like being in paradise. It would take them 7 weeks to make the same amount of money it would take them to make in a week in the USA. Like most of us say, it's all about money. That's basically what the world is based on. Anywhere that work can be done for little or nothing, that place and its people will be taken advantage of, like Mexico.

===message:Maquiladoras are exactly the opposite of what they seem. These foreign-owned businesses disguise themselves as opportunities or a way out for the citizens of troubled countries. The truth is that they are only in it for the money and could care less about the employees or their workign conditions. It is true that our country benefits from many of these establishments, but at what cost? Are we a country that is proud to say that we take advantage of others? I certainly hope not.

===message:Who benefits from maquiladoris? The program administrators, and the companies and countries that participate. It is a finacially attractive alternative to increasing profits. To me and me only, this is modern day slavery. To pay any human being less than a dollar an hour is ludicrous. Even though the cost of living in Mexico is far less than America, its still not enough to live comfortably. 
I don't see much positiveness about maquiladoris. Americans and Canadians have lost jobs, and annual salaries in new jobs averaged out at $4000.00 less. One small positive is for those who had nothing can now buy some food items and provide substandard shelter for his or her family. The negative aspect is the workers are black listed for speaking out and fired. They can't even afford to buy the same clothes they make. They have no benefits and each employee is expendable. There is always someone waiting to be hired so why show empathy or compasssion to the feelings of others. Another positive to all of this to be educated, proactive and marketable. In doing so, the affect of NAFTA won't be such a burden. You'll be able to roll with the punches and finding another job would be a lot easier.

===message:I think that the people in charge of putting it all together are the ones that profit.  That is the only reason they do it.  They know it will draw in large crowd, so the money signs shine in the business' eyes and whoever else benefits fom it.  I think it is pointless and they need to find better, safer ways to make money if they care that much about it.

===message:  On this particular topic, I have very much to say. Just because certain people were getting alot of benefits from NAFTA it doesn't mean it was right. That agreement didn't look out for the welfare of it's workers. If it wasn't for the worker it could not be a success. That agreement also didn't look out for the environment either. Wheither or not that NAFTA should expand should be a issue that people vote on.That decision shouldn't be left up to President Clinton. I feel I have the right ,as a U.S. citizen,to voice my opinion on that decision an the issue. I have to always remeber I am a worker somewhere,and I wouldn't want to lose my job that way. I have a family to care for!
