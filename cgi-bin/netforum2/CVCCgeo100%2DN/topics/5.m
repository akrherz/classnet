===subject:South American troubles
===message:Argentina is struggling. What other South American countries are having social and economic trouble? What is the basis for the economic crisis in South America? Last semester my sytudents all said that Artgentina needed "strong leaders". That is a lame answer. Argentina has had strong leaders, dictators and demagogues. They were only part part of the problem. The crisis is deeper than the issue of political leadership. What is wrong and how can  irt be fixed?

===message:I do not believe that it is the government. it requires the help of the people as while as the government. a strong leader is needed but the government requires help as while. once a country has been in depression it takes a long time to rebuild the country but if the people is whiling to help the government the country will get on its feet faster.

===subject:South American troubles
===message:Other than Argentina many other countries of South America are having the same troubles because South America to me is like a poor continent that do hard work but yet have to fight for every bit they try to claim.  Like them immigrating over to America to have better living space.  The work hard and get paid less but yet the workers here don't have to do any work at all but still get paid those big salaries.  Costa Rica, Cuba, Uraguay, Paraguay to name a few have hard times trying to fight for good living with good food.  The basis of the crisis in my opinion is everyone not wanting to work together and try to succeed at one thing.  Everyone is so greedy to try to get good food and great living space rather than wanting everyone to have that too.

===message: Reading this makes me think about the war  that we might have. I hope and pray that there is no war at all. I never experience war. But I think that it will be a crisis here in the United States. Because when there is action taken place, there is always a reaction going to occurr. I think that we ought  to be praying and taking notice of this. We  probably need to start saving  money at home  or storing extra food. We don't know what tomorrow holds for us. We have to take  it one  day at time and pray for the best. but in the meantime we have to be wise and think of our families welfare and our neighbors.It  was there time to be in a crisis and it might be our time now. Just pray that everything is going  to go fine. And believe that there is no blood shed.

===message:Argentina has succeeded in the past.  Citizens of Argentina need to focus on improving their economy and lifestyles.  They should stop blaming their failure on their leaders and take some initiative on their own to build their country back up.  The people could start by getting an education somehow or maybe by getting jobs and taking care of their families.  Maybe with help from the latest President Duhalde the people of Argentina may be able to reform.

===subject:Argentina in Crisis
===message:Other countries having social and economic trouble are, Guatemala, Columbia, Brazil and Honduras. The major challenges affecting leaders in these South American countries is the widening gap between the rich and poor. The richest 20% is 80 times richer than the poorest 20%. 40% of the population is living in severe poverty. Only 45% of children eligble for education are enrolled in school. This makes it impossible to move toward a technological stance. Before any change can take place, the children cannot be abandoned by their parents. Families need to be able to make enough money to maintain the household. The children will less likely be pushed out on the street. Now there are generations of children with nothing to live for. The government needs to clean up the existing problems and begin to look at inviting large industries in instead aquiring more loans. Provide on the job training for those lacking education. When the citizens of South America can have the five basic human needs fulfilled, South America will slowly begin to flourish. A leader can't fix anything unless he or she is likeable. Specifally the poor need to be able to trust whomever is in charge. This will cut down on social tensions before they turn violent. From the looks of it, I can't see the problem being fixed, but if some of my ideas are put in place, things will change slowly.

===subject:Argentina's Economic Problems
===message:Argentina is a country known for economic corruption. Many analysts have promoted the view that the Argentine national character is somehow responsible for the economic problems. Also, if the people would not repeatedly elect corrupt governments, they would have more opportunities than they do now. I suppose survival in a country that is rife with corruption requires that citizens develop skills that work well within a corrupt system. I strongly believe that if each member in the society would be better off if all members of the society no longer behaved corruptly. It seems the people are looking for someone who can deliver them from the collective madness of a system that does not serve them. I think the nation of people in Argentina  should come together and fight for a better economy.

===message:Even though Argentina is struggling now, many South American economies are falling afterwards. Economies such as Uraguay, Paraguay, Latin America, and Brazil are now feeling the effects of the finacail problems. I believe that it is not the leaders fault completley. You have to consider what kind of leaders there are to offer. But why can't the smaller countries come together and help each other. Many heads are better than one, it can't hurt anyway.

===message:After looking at the pictures and reading the info about the struggles in Argentina it really make you want to stop to think how much we take for granted. The people that live in that country are people just like us. They have families that need to be cared for as well. The United States is very lucky to have leaders that not only care about economic issues but also social issues as well. I do believe that if the leaders in Argentina would take a good look at the citizens then there would be more though put into decisions that can affect so many individual lives.

===message:I feel that yes argentina is in a crises but they are not the only ones Latin America, Uraguay and many others are in the same boat butI feel that we cannot put it all on the govt. Yes there are corrupt govts but there are also corrupt people within the govt also. some of these countries are not stong in wealth and power therefore their reliance on their govt is their only hope for survival and they are often left with no choice but to depend on them for their protection and their welfare. I feel that these problems are a combination of both the people and the govts faults. If they can come to an agreement on how one can help the other then that is a start to the problem then after they take the one step they can then take the second but it has to start somewhere first.
