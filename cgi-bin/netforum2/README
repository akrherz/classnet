This is NetForum 2.0.x To install it, run the INSTALL script
from the command line. Once NetForum 2.0.x is installed, configure the
sys_config file inside the 'lib' directory according to your site
specifications.

Alternatively, you can do what the install script does: 

o  set your umask to 0 
o  untar nf.tar (or if you have GNU tar use: 'tar xpvf nf.tar')
o  reset your umask


Move the nf_docs directory somewhere inside the htdocs directory in
your web server. 

If you have any problems configuring NetForum, please contact your
system administrator before contacting the NetForum development team.

You can find more information about NetForum on our web site:

	http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/netforum

Once you have configure the sys_config file, you can run NetForum from 
any browser that supports tables (i.e., Netscape 2.0). To create forums
run the admin script from the web by loading NetForum from the web:

http://your.url/your-cgi-directory/your-netforum-directory/admin/admin

The login and password are: "admin" and "admin" respectively, you may
want to change the password once you are ready to go.
