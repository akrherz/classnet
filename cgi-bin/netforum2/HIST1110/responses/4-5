===message:Gena, I agree with some of your statements, however there is one I would like to clear up for you, maybe give you a little more of an insight.  The United States needs to be involved with the Middle East right now.  People believe the war is over various reasons, oil, power, bombs, but it all boils down to Religion.  Ok, to start, there are two wars with equal amount of importance in each. Osama bin Laden to begin with started back during Desert Storm.  (Quick recap of Desert Storm, Iraq invaded Kuwait for their oil rich land, under Saddam Hussein’s command.)  We were neither the power nor the decision makers of going into the war; it was a decision of the United Nations.  Because we are the largest (and extremely powerful) military and have the most soldiers in the world, we were the ‘leaders’ in the war.  We were not the only country involved in that war though, Britain and Germany are two examples.  Osama bin Laden is against any religion in the world except his own.  When we needed to use Saudi Arabia’s bases in the war, Osama bin Laden said it was totally against their religion to allow any unholy person onto their territory.  He felt like we violated all of their religious beliefs.  So he turned around and began to train his followers to become terrorists.  Their mission was to wipe out all of the Christians in the world, especially Americans because we were in ‘violation of their holy land’.  He once stated that we would fall to pieces on our own land.  We are considered infidels. Now Iraq is one of the leading countries that supports and supplies money to these organizations of Terrorism.  They are manufacturing bio-chemical weapons and nuclear bombs.  After the Desert Storm, Saddam Hussein said he would stop manufacturing Chemical Warfare.  Guess what, he is one of the main manufactures of weapons still to this day….that needs to stop.  The reason why we bombed Afghanistan was because they would not turn over Bin Laden.  As far as Israel, Yasir Arafat wants total control of Palestine (he is the leader of the PLO and behind many suicide bombings against Jews) and he too is a major support for terrorism.  The way I look at it is I would rather President Bush shed blood on their land instead of my street and in my town, where our kids play.  You see, President Bush is doing his job, keeping terrorism on the other side of the planet away from your backyard.

===message:Keri, you said that you would rather President Bush shed blood in other nations instead of your own nation.  I understand this comment, but you also have to think of the other innocent people who are living in these other countries.  These people are not all bad, yet many of them will suffer from this war including children who are the same ages as the children playing on our streets.  My mother-in-law is Lebanese and is also Christian.  There are many Christian people in the Middle East (it’s not all Muslim).  Terrorism needs to stop not just in our country but in the whole earth.  You’re not solving anything by keeping it out of your own backyard.  Rather, it needs to be wiped off the face of the earth.  Don’t you agree?

===message:Wendy, yes I do agree with you, terrorism needs to be wiped out competely, but it will NOT happen without war.  Therefor, I would rather it be kept on the other side of the world, where the leaders and followers started it.  We Americans did not start Terrorism, so do not bring the war into our country.  We Americans however are trying to stop terrorism...and I feel sorry for all of the innoncent men and women and children of the countries, but don't you agree that where it started is where it should end?  Will try and explain futher when time finds me....

===message:Keri, I don’t think we have much control where wars start and end.  I very much see Americans under attack on our own soil.  For instance, look at what happened on 9/11.  Terrorism is happening pretty much everywhere -- on our soil and on the soil of other countries.  To me, the world seems to always be at war since there was never any true and lasting peace to begin with.  Yes, I would like to live in peace and security and the United States is more peaceful than a lot of countries and I’m thankful to live here, but what hurts another country’s innocents also hurts me and to deny that is to delude myself.

===message:I understand and respect your opinions; however, I totally disagree about not getting involved in other countries problems.  I am not saying that at every little dispute that comes up, we need to jump in and fight.  What I am saying is that some countries are helpless against the dominating and controlling larger countries and need support.  Do you think it was wrong for the United States to get involved when trying to defeat Hitler?  Over 6 million innocent people died because of one controlling (and irrational) belief.  When would of the destruction stopped if Americans didn't help?

===message:I still think war happens for greed of land.  Countries still try to take over land for more power.  This happened in the gulf war when Iraq took over Kuwait.  Then in other instances groups try to take over the land they live in from the leader at the time.
