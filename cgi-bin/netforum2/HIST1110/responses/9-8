===message:Kristin, yes the age of consumerism and materialism had definitely started in the 1950’s and had blossomed during the “Thirty Glorious Years.”  The Thirty Glorious Years may be over but consumerism definitely has not left us.  Just last night I was watching a television miniseries that had commercial breaks that were just as long as the movie itself!  This is very annoying to me as I’m sure it is to countless others.  I guess this type of spending really helps boost the economy, but where it might help the economy, I’m sure it hurts us moralistically.  We as individuals, feel cheated if we don’t have what the TV is telling us everyone else wants and/or has, and this can rearrange our priorities in a negative way.  What’s more, if we are not careful, we can get ourselves in a whole lot of debt by the all-to-easy temptation to “charge it.”

===message:Credit cards can be a necessary resource, however they also have allowed some of us to live beyond our means.  This is what occurred during the 1950's.  Credit cards seem like "free money" because making purchases with a credit card doesn't seem to have an impact on our finances until it builds up and we find ourselves in debt.

===message:Yeah, it seems so harmless at first until the bill comes in the mail. I do agree that credit can be very helpful its just that it must not be abused. Its interesting how easy it can seem when we talk about following these "common sense" rules for credit usage; I guess it just so much easier said than done.

===message:Kristin, yes.  This time of year is definitely steeped in holiday spending.  I believe companies try to perpetuate the idea of massive spending to boost their sales.  People feel guilty when they can’t get their child that much coveted Nintendo or whatever hot new item the kids go crazy for these days.  Instead of concentrating on material gift-giving, why not give the gift of love and support?

===message:Materialism has always existed, however, it definitely came to the forefront in the 1950's. I believe materialism is human nature and that is will always be a part of society. However, it can certainly have a negative a affect on a persons life, and a nation. Debts can get out of hand if a person is not careful when using credit to gain material items. If credit is used wisely, and not just to obtain nonessential material things, then it can be positive.

===message:I agree with you Wendy, 
There is a spell that gets us right around Christmas time that says, "spend, spend, spend!"
I work in retail and everyday since the day after Thanksgiving I have seen people who do not come out and shop very ofen go absolutley crazy- claiming that they should not spend the money- they spend because of the season and its usually on credit. Just another picture of how materialism has taken over the world and I must admit that we're all equally guilty of being pulled in to the season of spending. What other time of year does Khols have a 50% off one day sale every other day? You know what I mean? :0)

===message:I definitely agree that materialism came to a forefront in the 1950's.  I believe that all of the propaganda helped instill the desires of the American people.  There were several countries that did not have much, and people of the United States were depicted as having much.  This probably helped engage the "credit" spending.  Even though Americans could not afford things, they thought it was necessary (it was shown that Americans were prosperous) to stand up to what was being said. One segment of Episode 13 sticks out in my mind.  It was the lady talking about a car being a status symbol.  If you were any one, you would own a car (whether you could afford one or not) just to be "accepted" and fit in.  This holds true to this day.  Most women would be more easily persuaded to date a jerk in a Lexus rather than a sweetheart in a Pinto. How sad is that?

===message:Yes the credit card is a dangerous  item in the hands of someone who is easily influenced by what their neighbors have. So many people today are refinancing their homes to get enough money to pay off  their credit cards , but the problem seems to be that not everyone that does this cuts up the credit card and closes the account. The result of course is these people are then in debt again  to the credit card company and have also used up equity they had in their home. I do not think this was the general plan when credit was extended to people in the 1950s.
