===message:I have to agree also that the New Deal changed the way the American people viewed the way they felt about their government. Up until now there had not been a lot of help for the American people from the government concern their economic and social needs.  Roosevelt knew that something had to be done and done fast. He proposed  to help the people without totally turning the country into a socialist system like Europe had. After all that is the basis in which America was  founded because we originally we leaving England and her control.

===message:Gena, I agree that the New Deal affected many peoples lives for the better, but the Great Depression also changed they way many people lived.  For instance, my parents who were born around that time told me about how cheap things were then and how difficult it was to just get by.  Being raised in this environment has made them very fugal with their money.  To this day, my mother is always trying to find the cheapest gallon of milk or gas.  People, not trusting the economy and the banks, also would hide their money in their houses rather than deposit it in the banks, and some even died with their money still hidden away forgotten behind the walls of their houses or tucked away in their attics or basements.  This is real evidence of the psychological effects the Great Depression had on many people and proves just how devastating and difficult it really was.
