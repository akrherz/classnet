===message:I agree with your comment that we have fancy lives today, but I think that if we didn't have all the technological advances it would surprise you what people can actually do.  I was watching this television show where people choose to try to lives their lives as it was done years ago.  From having no electricity, to no phone, to havings to grow their own food and finding was to earn money when they needed to purchase the things they were unable to create.  If was kind of interesting because this one family started making moonshine, needless to say that the ended up surving better than the other families.  The other families put down this family basically saying they cheated by breaking the law, but it wasn't a game to be won or lost.  It was and experience to be lived.  If we had to go back to the simplier life I think people's abilities would surprise you.

===message:Melanie,
May I suggest that you type your comments and replies in Microsoft Word first and then copy/paste them into the “Message” section of your reply. This would allow you to gather your thoughts and check your grammar and spelling before posting them on ClassNet. It would also reduce the time needed “on-line” for those of you with slower Internet connections.
Best Regards.

===message:I agree with Debbie and Robert's statement and how it compares with situation today verses 100 years ago. But, I also like to add the crime status versus 100 years ago.
Crime today has the number one rating in America with the copycat abduction, raping, and murder of our little girls playing outside of their homes, innocent people dying due to robbery, and domestic violence.
People who lived 100 years ago had their problem but it does not compare to the "HELL" we live in today. They didn't have to fight terrorists and worry about if any one has high-jack a plane and crash it into a building.
The anniversary of the innocent victims who died on September 11 is coming soon, what else evil do America have to sustain.
So Yes, I believed that people who lived 100 years ago was better off than we are today.

===message:We are to a certain extent better off today than 100 years ago.  Medically, we have come up with ways to prevent, treat and cure diseases that couldn't be cured 100 years ago.  Technology has advanced so much that yes, we do live very comfortably today.  But who's to say that 100 years ago that lifestyle was not good?  I'm sure that the way the world was back then, if we had to, we could live just as comfortable.

===message:I agree that people certainly could live without all of the technological advances and luxuries that we have today. It would take some getting used to, but it always takes people some time to adjust to a changing society. When the technology that we enjoy today was in its beginnings, the people of that time had to adjust to being able to complete tasks more efficiently. People that had never used a microwave had to adjust there cooking and eating habits to incorporate the convenience of a microwave into their lives. We live our lives the way we do today because we have the technological advances to live a certain way. However, the people 100 years ago lived without this advanced technology and were able to survive.
