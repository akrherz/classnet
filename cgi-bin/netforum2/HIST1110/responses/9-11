===message:Eric, I agree with you. My grandparents moves to Philadelphia from Puerto Rico and my grandfather served in a war defending this country. They live in the inner city of Philadelphia and he speaks broken english and my grandmother speaks no english at all, til this day, but they live in a neighborhood filled with nothing but hispanic people so that wasn't too bad. My grandmother also worked in a factory. And she raised 7 children and took care of the house. I know it was rough for her but she pulled through it.

===message:Yes, it is interesting that the plight of the poor and black citizens was not addressed in the video. The U.S. was given a happy glow that was implied to have existed for every citizen. The rise of middle class society and suburban America seemed to be the norm for all Americans in the video. However, while some Americans were advancing, others were declining.
