===message:"Pacifism, disarment, and peaceful negotiation will not work unless all people are willing to accept these principles."  I 100% agree with your statement, however, do you believe this will EVER happen?  I do not.  Evil will always bear many different faces and as long as there is evil on this earth, there will be war.

===message:Your comment about pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiations working only if people accept these principles is an interesting one.  Do you believe that people will ever accept them?  I don't.  I think nations pick people to represent them and their country.  People protest and encourage their leaders to have "peace talks," and the leader follows through and a pact is made then broken later because of circumstances or deceitfulness on the part of the leader.  I think if everyone was honest and their word was their bond, these three things still wouldn't be enough to ever keep war from happening.  Too many hidden agendas.
