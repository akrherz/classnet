===message:Even though I half-way agree that today is better living with our stability and all, it's hard to say that I wouldn't want to be envolved in the first this and that.  What I mean is that to say "I was there when they figured out how to use elctricity for light" or "I remember the first time I saw a movie." I don't remember the first time I saw a movie.  What if I could say "I remember when they came out with movies" not just "I rememer when they came out with Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" I only experience advances and variations of the same old stuff.  "I'm not impressed.  It doesn't exite me.  That's it?" and "It's about time" is about as much as I've got when it comes to the marvels of new inventions.  It's all the same.  I'm not astanished by the creativity and baffeld by the wonder of it all.  I don't care how it works.  It just works.  That's what modernized living has done to me.  I'm numb to new stuff because nothing's really new to me.  No I haven't seen it all but I've seen enough to anticipate sequals and concepts that are yet to come.  I like new stuff and new ideas but they don't catch my attention much.  I think I would have liked all the newness of those old days when everything around you was brand new to you and you didn't get how it works or where it came from but it blew your mind.  Yeah those were the days I believe.
