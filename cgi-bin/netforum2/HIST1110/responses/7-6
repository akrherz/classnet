===message:Hi Keri, I appreciate your opinions and previous statements. However, I think your statement, "We never purposely exterminated any race, never created prison camps where we
KILLED the imprisoned ones, never told Americans that one race was pure, never burned bodies to dispose of, or to rid the evidence of our wrong doings, never made lamp shades out of human skin, we Americans as a whole are NOTHING like the
Nazi population and never will be" is a very strong statement, which I will comment on.  On the surface, it does not seem as if the US never created prison camps where the imprisoned ones were killed.  However, white Americans did not literally say that this was their motive, but essentially this is what they were doing to Native Americans and African-Americans but this is so.  Examples of such is clear throught history, plantations and prisons in the US during the enslavement of African-Americans.  Reservations for Native Americans is a parallel to this as well.  It does not seem as if the US was as delibert as the Nazis but there are similarities which can not be denied, downplayed or discounted.

===message:I have agree with what Janna said.  When I first read the question I thought we are nothing like the Germans,but when you really think about some of the things that we have done in our history can seem just as bad.  I will say that we never tried to exterminate a whole race, but we did say that we were better than some races such as African-Americans.  As with the American Indians we took thier land from them force them onto reservations and then unknowlingly killed them with the diseases that we transmitted to them.

===message:Though we have come a long way from the nineteenth century, we must not forget the Trail of Tears where thousands of Native Americans were forced to move and several thousand  died.  However, it is not the number that matters. One person dying due to intolerance or ignorance as happened in the Bronx two years ago is one too many.

===message:Ms. Zink, I agree with you about your statement that read, "Anyone who says American's ideas, attitudes, or beliefs were like the Nazis' or Hitler's" should be appalled.  We have never come close to committing any of the horrors that Hitler committed.  You are right, we have never made one attempt to create a master race.  We have and do let immigrants into our country from all over the world.  Just as it says on the Statue of Liberty...Give me your hungry, your tired, and your poor.  We have done that time and time again regardless of race, creed, or color.

===message:You really believe our country wants doctors, sciencists, etc?  This country is exactly what Debbie said, Good point Debbie.

This country does allow with open arms the hungery, tired, and poor of other countries, why do you think we are the most multicultured nation in the world?

===message:I agree with your idea that the American people have never thought as our way is the only way. We have never made the claim of being a master race. We have opened our doors to all peoples from all nations to come and live and become a part of this nation and its future. They used to call us a melting pot and at one time we were, and this was one of our strenghts. People left their families and all that they held dear to come to America to live in the land of the free. We have made mistakes as we have grown,and we have learned from these mistakes. The American people as a whole would never agree to exterminate another race of people because we are made up from of all races of people.

===message:To paraphrase someone whose name escapes me, "this country stinks but when compared with every other country in the world throughout history including today is the greatest country ever."  However let's be honest the British changed laws not to long ago in an attempt to stop the Brain Drain to the United States.  Do you honestly believe that if we had to choose between einstein and a AIDS victim who would we choose to come in?

===message:I agree that Americans never tried to exterminate another race.  However, I disagree that we are not somewhat like the German Nazi.  Again I will say that Americans never tried to exterminate an entire race, but Americans have views of what the ideal man or woman should look like just like Hitler thought the perfect German was blond hair and blue-eyed.  If you go to the doctor, there are charts that state what weight you should be for your height.  There are more and more plastic surgeons coming into practice everyday.  Why?  Because Americans try to fit the profile of the "perfect" person.  When you fill out an application for a job, some companies ask if you have ever had a mental illness - why?  It shouldn't matter, but it does because it is something that does not fit into the "norm."  I think that while we do not outwardly express our beliefs and opinions, many look at persons with a different appearance and turn their head.

===message:There are many similarities between the persecution of Jews by Germany and the destruction of Native Americans by the White race. I do not feel Blacks were persecuted to the extent Jews and Native Americans were. Americans drove Native Americans off their own lands and forced them to stay on reservations. Blacks were slaves and they were persecuted but they were not killed in the same numbers as Jews and Native Americans.
