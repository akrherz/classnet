===message:I agree that war happens because the leaders of the countries that are fighting have something that one or the other wants. I think that wars are useless and that the only thing that they truly accomplish is killing a lot of people that had nothing to do with the start of the war anyway. I think that the soldiers explanation of why wars happen is accurate. One country offends another and the offended country wants to retaliate by gathering all of its allies and fighting. The older soldier was right on the money in my opinion because it is the leaders and not the people who decide to go to war. In some cases pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiations can prevent wars from happening but both sides have to have strong leaders who won't get easily offended by what the other has to offer. Like she stated above I don't believe that those things will ever prevent all wars from happening because everyone wants to be in control of everyone else. The USA is such a wonderful country that people from other places are determined to destroy it. So unfortunately we have to defend ourselves and so begins another war.

===message:Wars not only happen because another country wants that particular country, but wars also happen because of politicians because another country wants another country's resources, such as oil.  Many people get rich off of wars.  For instance, Locheed, Boeing, and weapon manufacturers.  I agree with you that many countries have been jealous of the USA because we are the surpreme power!  The USA always seems to come to the aid of other countries that are being invaded, but look what the UN is doing for us.....So far, nothing!

===message:In response to Melonie:

   I agree with your position on the causes of war.  The provocation of one nation leads to the entanglement of several regions.  I think history saw this best portrayed in World War I.  The European "powder keg" was set to explode as several countries became entangled among each other through informal treaties.  As soon as the spark was set off--in this case, the assasination of Archduke Ferdinand--the whole continent erupted.  Also, I think this was the main goal of the League of Nations, and subsequently the United Nations.  The idea that a group of countries employ diplomacy and stick up for each other in one big commitment to one another, rather than many small informal treaties is a great movement toward World Peace.

===message:I am curious as to why you think freedom in this country comes at the price of war?  Why do you think the United States is constantly at the threat of war?  You stated that war is caused when other countries want some resource from another country.  What resource does the United States have in abundance that other nations may want?

===message:Melonie, you really have to look at the underlying reason of why one leader wants to take control of another country.  There are many surface reasons but I believe it stems from either fear or greed.  Aggressive countries want more control and superiority whether political or economical and retaliating countries are fearful for their own future.  It’s all in the balance of power.  Is that why you believe that the USA is more threatened than the rest of the world?
