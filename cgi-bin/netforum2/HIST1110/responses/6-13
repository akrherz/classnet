===message:Sports are very symbolic to society and particularly the American society.  The fight between Louis and Schmelling brought was more than a boxing match, it was about nationalism.  For Americans, sports have always taught children (and adults) the value of "being a team player" and working hard to achieve one's dreams.  The instinctive competitve drive fuels athletes and fans to excel in all aspects.  Sports reinforce the idea that you can do anything you want to with hard work and desire.  Sure, some athletes find themselves under scrutinty (or arrest), but the majority reinforces the American Dream.

===message:Keith I agree with you that the Lewis-Schmeling fight was more than just a boxing match. It brought many Americans together. When Lewis beat Schmeling this showed Hitler that an American especially an African-American could defeat him and his people. And this gave American the confidence to do whatever they wanted to do. Babe Ruth and joe Lewis proved that anyhting is possible with hard work and determination.

===message:I don't think that when Lewis won the boxing match that it showed that blacks could beat Germany.  I really don't believe that it had anything to do with blacks winning.  It was more of America vs Germany.  This fight was a moral booster for America, not anything to do with blacks.

===message:Maybe you miss understood or read too much into my sentence. I did not mean that blacks could beat Germany. What I meant was that blacks were considered to be lower then "pure" Germans and in boxing beat what they considered to be a "pure" German. This of course was America vs. Germany, but whose side was Louis on? I don't think it was the Germans. So yes this fight symbolized that an "inferior" person and country could defeat the Germans. Hope I cleared it up for you.
