===message:Kristen, I strongly agree with your statement. Some Americans were living the life of the rich and famous, while other Americans were struggling to figure out where they were going to get their next meal to feed themselves and their families, or finding shelter to lay their heads. So the boom time era of the 1950s had a lot of disadvantages besides focusing on the prosperous American dream.

===message:Yeah, even though that period was characterized as a boom time, the nation was still unstable in many areas such as social conflicts especially those concerning racial issues. The fifties were a time when the the movement for equality began to finally get on its feet and pursue its goals. Although a gap has always existed between the wealth and poverty, wouldn't you say that movies today do a better job at portraying poor America as well as affluent America?

===message:Kristin, do you really think all americans are aware of the poverty that exist right here in the United States? Do you think americans are aware of what really happens in "ghettos" and "slums" in the United States?  I dont mean what you see on the nightly news or read in the paper.  Granted for some americans that is the only way they receive information about these areas in the country.  Where was the "Marshall Plan" for americans who were not prosperous in the 1950's?  Just a thought

===message:You're right, that is a very interesting thought. I guess that just backs up the idea that America was showing off in its execution of the Marshall Plan.

===message:Kristin, your last reply is exactly what Stalin was trying to say when he said that U.S. was imperialist.  As a matter of fact, were still imperialist.   Americans were showing off because they wanted the whole world to be like them so that they could have the ultimate power over those weaker countries.  The Marshall Plan wasn’t really about helping those countries but to influence the other countries’ citizens to support U.S.  However, it was a smart thing to do because U.S. was also making allies even though they had their own agenda.

===message:Yvelle, I think the Marshall Plan was great tactic to defeat communism. Even though selfish motives were visible, overall I see it as an effective plan. Thank you for your posting.
