===message:Kristin, I echo most of the sentiments in your response. You are right to say that Tyson, Moss, Williams, and Caminitti should not be admired for their off the field actions. I am not sure that you feel this way, but I think that the difference in today’s athletes is the media attention. I see Barry Bonds’ face on my television at least ten times a day so if he ever has an altercation with a waitress at a restaurant, I will probably know about it before his wife does. I am somewhat surprised that we don’t get a Sportscenter update on what he ate for breakfast this morning (Ambrosia?). When the average person clocks-out of their job at the factory and goes home and maybe slaps their spouse, the news of it doesn’t get put on the continuous ticker at the bottom of the latest CNN broadcast. The media attention on sports has multiplied 1000 times what it was in the twenties. It is no longer enough to report the scores of the games and who hit a homerun. Could you imagine Babe Ruth, in all of his drinking glory, was part of the sports scene today?.........He would be crucified without mercy. There would be unconfirmed rumors reporting that he is on steroids. His athletic ability would become part of the freak-show soap opera that his sports career would become - sold to the public by the media. And his athletic ability, the thing that made him successful and famous, would ironically destroy the personal part of his life (which had nothing to do with his baseball ability in the first place). Excuse the pun, but it is two, totally different ball-games when trying to compare athletes today to those of the twenties. The differences are astronomical.

===message:I completely agree with your stance on today's "hyper-media."  Athletes of yesteryear would have no chance in today's media lion pit.  Hungry for a story, the media over analyzes every move that a celebrity makes.  Purely by overexposure, today's athletes simply seem more unethical compared to the 1920's role models.

===message:Robert,
you made a really good point. sports really is nothing like it was in the beginning. sure, there was advertisements and such, but i agree with you that all the in depth coverage of pro athlete's personal day to day buisness has gotten to be pretty rediculous. i also agree that it doesn't help athletes to have all eyes on their personal lives.

===message:I agree with the both of you as far as saying that Tyson, Moss, Williams, and Caminiti, have done many not so admirable things in their careers.  However, let us not forget that at one point in time they were great sports figures.  People can still admire the great ability these athletes possessed.  They are all great athletes and we should remember that they are ordinary people only with extraordinary jobs.  Media focuses too much attention on their personal lives.  Also, the things people value today are much different than what they valued years ago, and since these sports figures are so popular, the media is there to capture everything wrong that they do.  I'm sure if society was structured back then the same way it is now, the drunken glutton Babe Ruth, wouldn't look as good as he did.

===message:I appreciate all of the replies and agree with most of you.  However, sport media is still doing the same thing it did in the twentieth century.  Robert, you are right when you stated that sport media goes beyond the scoreboard.  In my opinion, the sport media is showing that although athletes are superstars with lots of money that they too have issues.  And it’s sad to say, people love to see other people with issues too.  But on a positive note, today’s athletes show people that their dreams can also come true.  And some of these athletes are doing numerous things for our communities.

===message:The points made are very well stated, and for the most part absolutely true.  I am not an avid sports fan, and I do not watch many games at all.  So, my question is:  How is it that I know about all of the qualms of Tyson, Moss, Williams, and Camanitti?  I don't even have to watch ESPN or CNN, I see the athletes' mistakes aired on the local news.  Media coverage thrives on airing the bad mistakes of everyone in the spotlight, not just athletes.  Could you imagine how long the news would run if every person who has done something illegal in the United States had their stories told every night at 5:00?
