===message:I agree with your statement Robert. War do put you in the image of people fighting over control from economics, religion, preventing nuclear war fare and etc.
As you stated, the common denominator in negotiations is the value for human life. If this doesn't happens, war is the only solution.

===message:Good point Robert. Unlike wars of the past, modern wars are not about ideological, political, or economic issues, they are cultural. Post-Cold War politics is now the interaction of Western power and culture with the culture and power of non-Western civilizations such as Confucian and Islamic societies. It is one of Western universalism and Muslim militancy. One grim philosophy of life for this new era was well expressed by the Venetian nationalist demagogue in Michael Dibdin’s novel, Dead Lagoon: “There can be no true friends without true enemies. Unless we hate what we are not, we cannot love what we are. These are the old truths we are painfully rediscovering after a century and more of sentimental cant. Those who deny them deny their family, their heritage, their culture, their birthright, their very selves! They will not lightly be forgiven.” The unfortunate truth in this cannot be ignored. For peoples seeking identity and reinventing ethnicity, enemies are essential and the potentially most dangerous enemies occur between the world’s major civilizations. Worse yet, many of our enemies, such as fanatical, extremist Muslims, are living in our own country and are protected by our laws.

===message:That is a great quote, Doug, and it is so true. It is nice to see that someone in this course has  similar historical perspectives to my own. Every era of the world’s history has been filled with wars of conquest and religion. And more times than not, the true explanation of these events stare many history enthusiasts in the face as they stumble over society’s desire for political correctness. Many, including some in this class (at least from what I’ve read in response to my postings here), dismiss war as blood and guts, guns and death. As true of a characterization as that may be on a superficial level, war has provided all of us a place to live and the right to choose our government and some sense of security against our foes. If you get a chance, take a look at some of the responses that I have received on the first three topics. Maybe I am a bit cynical at times, but I feel like views like yours and mine are being dismissed merely because they discuss war and society on a deeper level and may sound threatening to the mainstream, politically correct school of thought. What do you think?

===message:Thank you Robert and I agree 100%. In the aftermath of the Cold War the United States has become consumed with massive debates over the proper course of American foreign policy. In this era, however, the United States can neither dominate nor escape the world. Neither internationalism nor isolationism will serve our interests best. Most disturbing in today’s society is the fact that some Americans are promoting multiculturalism at home and universalism abroad. Multiculturalism at home threatens the United States and the West. Universalism abroad threatens the West and the world. Unfortunately, both deny the uniqueness of Western culture. The domestic multiculturalists want to make America like the world. A multicultural America is impossible because a non-Western America is not American. A perfect display of this was given on October 16th, 1994, in Los Angeles. Thousands of people marched beneath a “sea of Mexican flags” protesting Proposition 187. One observer asked, “Why are they walking down the street with a Mexican flag and demanding that this country give them a free education? They should be waving the American flag.” Two weeks later more protestors did march down the street carrying an American flag…upside down. The preservation of the United States and the West depends on Americans reaffirming their identity and accepting their civilization as unique, not universal, and uniting to preserve it against non-Western societies. Before you know it they’ll try to ban the Pledge of Allegiance in our school systems. ;-(

===message:The previously stated opinions are rightly justified, however I don't necessarily agree that the only resort to disagreement between countries is to engage in war.  There have been instances in history where conflicts have been resolved in peace.  In addition, one must always ask his/herself whether or not taking part in war is a must to defend one's well-being and way of life.  From there, one can come closer to a better decision.

===message:In All Quiet On The Western Front, the soilders humorously discussed the reasons for war.  These underlying basic reasons were similar to a school-yard fist fight.  The men explain that war is the result of two country's having an argument, and the example of one people disliking another.  Since the soilder's did not have any prolem with anyone, he wanted to go home.  This makes good satire, but is tremendously unrealistic.  After the events of the Twentieth Century have taught world leaders (those who believe in the repetition of history, anyway)that isolationsim is not a workable policy for preventing war.  Which, the United States almost learned the hard way in both World War I and World War II.  As if government leaders had not learned from the previous generation's mistakes, they continued to ignore the war until it became a clear and present threat to us.  
    Wars happen for many reasons, but more often are set up by leaders seeking their own agendas.  For example, the French fear and dislike of the Germans after World War I prompted French delegates to persuade the League of Nations to place tremendous reparations on the Germans for the War, admit that the Germans were solely responsible for the War (even though history proves this wrong), and sets up Germany's resolve to rise to revenge in Europe.  World War II was a direct result of the French fear of German invasion.  France seized the oppurtunity, during the League of Nations debates to disarm Germany, thereby removing that fear.
    This is one of the main problems with negotiating issues among world leaders.  Too often, issues cannot be fairly resolved because of extreme nationalism above the purpose of the organization of countries.  This became apparent in the first test of the League of Nations when Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in search of colonization.  The leader of Ethiopia pleads for the League of Nations involvement but is denied.  This was exactly the type of circumstance for which the League was created.  
     Negotiations are important to prevent large scale wars based on misunderstanding, but much improvement will have to be made within these organizations to truely foster change.  Even today, the UN either doesn't have enough power, or enough concern to hold up the agreement with Iraq.  The ideas are in place to prevent future wars, but much more work will have to be done before the world can practice total and successful pascifism.

===message:Although, I do agree with your statement that negotiation with those that do not value human life is hopeless, I disagree that war is the only answer.  Where their are 100 people who have them same views as certain extremists, their are certaintly 100 more.  I wish I had the answer to how to negotiate with these people, but I do know that violence is not the answer.

===message:You do not KNOW that violence is not the answer, it is merely your opinion. The reason that you cannot come up with a viable alternative is because none exist. I am not advocating violence here. However, I am advocating war as a sometimes necessary solution to differences – which it is against extremism. Whether the number is 100 or 1,000,000 , the basic concept of war is not to kill or be violent. It’s intent is to break the spirit of one’s opponent by making him feel as if surrender is his only option. The casualties are only a byproduct of  the battles themselves. And when the spirits and ambitions of an Adolf Hitler or an Osama Bin Laden cannot be persuaded, they must be broken by force. Even you admit that negotiation, in these cases, is hopeless. So what other alternative is available?

===message:It is simply inappropriate and disrepectful to suggest that a fellow student's opinion is "merely their opinion" just because what they believe counteracts with your own opionions.  Velkys opinion's concerning the issue as to whether or not wars are necessary may not be justified in your opinion, but using "shouting words" (capitalized words) to get your point across is just unprofessional.

===message:I agree that war is not the answer in some cases and problems could be solved by negotiations. War should be used as a last result in a dispute between two countries. The disagreement should be talked out by the two countries in conflict by negotiating the issue(s), coming to a common ground, or agreeing to disagree and leaving the matter alone. If none of these can be accomplished then, yes, war is the only solution. At times you may have leaders who are willing to think things out and save the human lives of their country and if this is a case where there can be a resolution that will can take place. But as Robert Jones said if there are leaders and terrorist like Adolf Hitler and Osama Bin Laden then war is the only solution because people like this are not willing to work things out. It is either their way or no way because they will kill you. This is a hard reality to face, but not everyone is willing to do things in a peaceful manner and people who are not willing to need some kind of harsh action taken against them. I am in no way supporting war but I do think that sometimes this is what it all comes down to at the end.

===message:I believe that wars do happen sometimes because of the need for power by leaders of a country, however wars occur for other reasons such as, terrorism. We are about to go to war because we are trying to protect our people and our freedom. Wars have been fought because of not neccessarily countries wanting the actual land but wanted it for the valuable resources found on or in the land such as, oil.
