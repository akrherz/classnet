===message:You have made many good points about how well the world is now days.  Most people 100 years ago did not live far away from families, so traveling far distances was mostly for pleasure.  The advances in technology with radios, televisions, and telephones are wonderful, but in my beliefs they reduce the amount of quality time spent with family and friends.  Yes, we have more abundance of food, but what happened to the nutrition we used to receive with our meals?  There are new advances in medicine, but look at all the new diseases.  AIDS and the recently discovered West Nile Virus never existed before, and they are now killing people.  Finally more people are employed, but the hours of commuting and spending at work are tremendous.  People work long hours to afford the luxuries technology has brought about, but have little time to spend on themselves and loved ones.  Granted, I would not want to live a life of 100 years ago, but some of the things that are better in life, have taken away from our values and morals.

===message:Hi Stephanie, 
I totally agree with you that some of the good things in life have brought about total degeneration in values and morals in this age like never before, but I want to retouch on the subject of deadly or incurable diseases; not enough time for loved ones; and the transportation issue. Those diseases like Aids and West Nile virus may have been present 100 years ago, but the thing was that they didn’t just know it.  People died of mysterious diseases that were never diagnosed, and there’s no way for us to know now what they were.  The good part is that during our time, we have researchers who are trying their best to find a cure for these deadly diseases.   Regarding the amount of time we spend with family; I think that is totally by choice.  We have a lot of choices in this day and age, one of which is peoples's preference to work longer hours at times in order to make more money, settle debt, or to improve their general standard of living. Some, however, wouldn’t want to be away from their family too long, but would rather go home after the usual work hours regardless of how much they make.  In as much as people lived close together at that time, they did not only need to visit each other, but also needed to do fun things with family members like going places and getting around which was not very easy at that time because of inadequate means of transportation.

===message:I agree with what Stephanie said about how even though we have all these positive advaces in technology there are also the negatives that go along with them. Working with children I have noticed that the best way to get them to settle down is by turning on the TV or putting them in front of a computer. Whatever happened to doing simple things like arts and craft projects, playing broad games, or even just socializing with friends? And to think that these children probably go home and do the same thing(watch TV, sit in front of a computer, play video games)everyday and not spend any time with family and friends. What is happening to our social skills? Yes technology has brought us a long way but it also has us so hooked that sometimes we forget things of importance.

===message:I read several of the replies to your paragraph before I decided to post mine.  Yes, as a human race we have developed many advancements that make life much simpler and longer.  Yes, because of these same advancements it seems we do not have enough hours in the day to enjoy our lives.  But, what is the point of all these advancements in technology and medicine if all of the human race can't benefit from them.  It is sad that we have advanced so much, but a majority of the citizens in the world have not benefited from these advancements.  With a 100 years of technology under our belt, you would think someone would come up with a way that all citizens of the world could share in this advancements.  Why are people still dying of treatable and curable diseases?  Will it take another 100 years before this happens?

===message:I agree we are better off today than we were 100 years ago in some aspects.  Look at how far we have come as far as technology and medicine goes.  Life expectancy has gone up, due to the advancements in medicine.  Diseases that once wiped out thousands of people are now curable.  The invention of computers have made so many people successful.  It produces several millionaires every year, something that couldn't happen 100 years ago.  But most importantly, we as a nation, as far as ethnicity goes, have come a long way.  While there are still issues as far as race goes, skin color isn't as prevalent as it used to be.  In today's world, it seems to be more about making money.  There are African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, etc., that are now some of the most successful entertainers and business people in the world.  One hundred years ago, the opportunity wasn't even there.  While the world still isn't perfect, we have come a very long way in 100 years.
