===message:FDR did save America in that day and time.  He did help everyone's life and made life worth living.  We are now suffering from the new deal though.  Welfare and Social Security are a disaster.  Our corrupt government just as anyone else cannot be trusted to manage millions of dollars to distribute to the poor and the elderly.
