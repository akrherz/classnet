===message:They say pride comes before a fall.  Again, we hear we must “love our neighbors as ourselves.”  These two statements might ruffle some feathers but they are statements we must always keep in mind if we want to improve our lives and attain a better standard of living.  Many Europeans of the twentieth century believed they were superior to everyone else.  They gobbled up the land of primitive and helpless peoples and used it to their advantage.  These actions cause wars and lead to a worsened state of living condition, both morally and physically.

===message:Debbie, I must disagree with some of the ideas in your reply. Did you ever wonder where those crooked and wavy lines came from on a World Atlas that divide one country from another? They came from stronger groups "gobbling up" the land of the primitive and helpless. Now, I’ll grant you that these actions cause war, but that is the nature of the world we live in – always has been. And "Pride comes before a fall"? What pride, specifically, was The United States guilty of  when it was attacked?

===message:I do agree that as a nation the United States is divided.  But you also have to think about the citizens and background of the citizens of this country.  The division in this country is due to the cultural differences of its immigrant citizens not the lack of national pride.

===message:Robert, you stated in your message that in 1900 the people possessed an innocence, which people are you referring to?  Do you call lynching an act of innocence because that's what was going on in the early 1900s.  African americans were lynched because of their color or for alleged crime that they weren't even given a chance to defend themselves.  And you are right when you said that the innocence may not be regained because you still have people walking around with a racist mentality.

===message:Velkys.....While I understand  that there are many backgrounds and much ethnic diversity in the United States, I don’t think the reason that we are divided has anything to do with that. I think it is the fact that some groups take the country’s security for granted.

===message:Yvelle, let me say that I totally agree that the lynching of blacks in America was a terrible thing. In fact, I think the first year in our history in which a hanging was not recorded was in the late forties. However, my posting had absolutely NOTHING to do with race. I find it troubling that your appreciation for this country’s history is clouded by incidents that, when looked at relatively, were not that widespread. The innocence that I referred to in my message was that of a time when crime levels were lower and genuine compassion for others existed. I also find it disconcerting that the only two messages you have posted here, so far, have been on the topic of race. Surely there are other ideas you have about our history
