===message:I agree, the passion for power is one of the most driving factors in a leader/nation's decision to fight in a war.  This situation is comparable to the business world as well.  Economic power directs how decisions are made and ultimately if nations are viewed as world powers.  When a nation/leader feels that they are an economic power over other countries, they sometimes begin to demonstrate this control via violence and war.

===message:I agree with Keri that the passion for power is what causes countries to go to war. This reminds me of the " Killing Fields" episode because those men were fighting and dying day after day by the thousands in order to preserve a few miles of territory. To think that so many lives were lost for the cause of passion for power makes me sick. When I was refering to pride in my initial discussion I really do believe that it was the passion for power that I thinking about, but was not quite able to put into words.
Pride was the more general theme, but passion  for power was the specific thought that hit the nail on the head. Thank you for your helpful insight. Also I thought it was really cool how Janna linked the passion for political power to the passion for economic power to the causes of war. Thank you both.

===message:The World War I soliders portrayed in "All Quiet On The Western Front" denied the necessity of war.  Through satire, they oversimplified the causes of the war and took a stand for pacifism.  I agree that many innocent men died-men who did not care about the assasination of some leader in some other country thousands of miles from home.  They did however, care about the German agression towards innocent people, specifically the sinking of the Lusatania.  The United States, if not the soilders, cared about the note sent to Mexico from Zimmerman promising a requsition of Texas lost in the 19th Century.  The Americans of that time tried to preserve a neutral attitude, but were forced into the fight.  I agree with your statment that pacifism will never prevent war.  The hope is that we can possably prevent large-scale wars such as WWI and WWII.  The enforcement of policy and human rights will have to continue to preserve justice and faith in the United Nations.

===message:Keri, Lord Acton, once said that “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.”  This quotation sums up what you were saying about man’s need for power.  I totally agree with you.  You see this corruption between the sexes, races, and religious sects.  When are people going to grow up and stop this selfishness?  Many political leaders do not promote confidence in the people they rule.  Rather they instill a fear or hatred of others.  This justifies many acts of aggression that need not take place.  We all must see beyond our political barriers and recognize that we all depend on one another and we are all interrelated.

===message:I believe that wars do happen sometimes because of the need for power by dictators of a country, however wars occur for other reasons such as, the situation we are in now.  We are about to go to war because we are trying to protect our people and our freedom.  As for Vietnam, we were coming to the aid of another country.  Wars have been fought because of not neccessarily countries wanting the actual land but wanted it for the valuable resources found on or in the land such as, oil.  As far as your take on "All Quiet on the Western Front" I agree that many innocent men were killed and didn't even know what they were fighting for.  They were drafted and had to go.

===message:Read my reply to Gena...The war we are involved in now has a lot to do with power and religion, not just territory.  Maybe I will allow you to see a different view of the War against Terrorism.

===message:Thank you all for your responses.  I’m not sure if response stated the same as you all but it was exactly the point I was trying to get across.  Keri, you are absolutely right when you say that none of the countries in this world would be willing to give up their power for peace.  Power to countries is like air to humans.  A country without power is nothing, which means they have no say in anything.  Just like Keri, Janna and Wendy stated, there are different forms of Power.  Power is not limited to politics.  It involves a lot of our daily struggles with society.

===message:Keri, you are a true American.  I am with you on going to protect my country in a heartbeat.  Yes, wars sometimes seem to be unnecessary, but if I could do anything to protect the rights we have as Americans....Adios because my bags are packed.  Disarmament, pacifism, and peaceful negotitations will never cease war (maybe they will help to lessen the amount of destruction that could occur).  Wars have been going on from the begining of time.  They started on a small scale from fighting with family or neighbors, to chemical warfare and sneak attacks.  I imagine that future generations will see things we can not even fathom.

===message:The need for power can be a determining factor in the origin of wars. Hitler is a great example of this concept. He led the German people into a war that he had been dreaming about for sometime. Hitler wanted Germany to be the greatest, largest power in the world. In order for this dream to come true, Hitler had to lead Germany into WWII so Germany could gain more power by defeating other countries. If this had occured, Hitler could have imposed his will and forced countries, such as Britain and France, to follow his direction.
