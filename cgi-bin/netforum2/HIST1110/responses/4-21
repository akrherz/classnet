===message:I agree with everything that you said except that disarmament, pacifism, and peaceful negotitations can prevent war.  If there were no evil souls on the planet, maybe this could be true, but there is too much evil and greed in humans today.  Even if all weapons were taken away and destroyed, people would find other resources as weapons.  Bin Laden used our own aircraft.  In peaceful negotitations, someone will not be satisfied.  It would be liking sitting ten 5 year old boys around in a circle with 9 toys.  One boy would not be satisified and cause problems.  Pacifism will not work because there are too many people who are angry and want to fight.  Too bad that "we can't all just get along."
