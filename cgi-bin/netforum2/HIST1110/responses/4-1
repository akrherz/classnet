===message:I agree with your statement about what you wrote in your discussion. The novel "All Quiet on the Western Front" describes the terrifying ordeal endured by thousands of soldiers in the war. Similar encounters occurred between French and German soldiers almost daily during the world war that lasted from 1914 to 1918. At the time, the war was called the "Great War." After 1939, when a second global conflict broke out, the earlier war was called "World War I."
In the early 1900s, people in Western Europe and the United States had great confidence in Western Civilization. During the past few decades, they had carried their ideas and traditions to every corner of the globe. Many people believed that through international treaties and law western civilization had at last discovered how to keep peace. But in 1914, the peace was shattered.
Europeans suffered through the most devastating war they had ever known. The war profoundly changed not only Europe but also other parts of the world.
People still debate the question of war guilt-which nation or nations were responsible for the outbreak of war. Most people agree that no one power was responsible. Years of tension in Europe and overseas had contributed to the climate of war. When war came, many people welcomed it.
Others, however, feared what war might bring.

===message:Doug, a different perspective was exactly what you offered…Good too.  But do you believe Freud?  Do you really turn to war to work off the intolerable burden of civilization and boredom or do you turn to war to prove power?  Internal desires was what Freud’s theories was based off of, the unconscious desires each of us have drive us to act a certain way, understand society differently, or just explain why each of us are different.  But is he saying we all have unconscious desires to kill to relieve steam and boredom?  Or is this just an excuse?  Like all of Freud’s theories, it seems to me as though he gives excuses for an individual’s actions instead of allowing the individual to take responsibility for their ‘unconscious desires’.  Science now is actually proving Freud’s theories wrong.  It is a nature/nurture concept and science in the 21st century is proving it is more nature than we expected.  Certain individuals are born with a lack of efficient chemicals which enables to ‘act a certain way’, i.e. hyperactivity.  I can not disagree with your opinion, because it is your opinion, however I would like to know, do you really agree with Freud?
