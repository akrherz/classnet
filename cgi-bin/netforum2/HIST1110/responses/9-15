===message:I agree with you.  An important aspect of the 50's that I was disappointed in not seeing was the African Americans equal rights.  It is an important aspect of American history and an extremely interesting part of our history.  Last year my us history teacher (here at clayton) really went into dept with a lot of the civil rights history that no teacher had ever brought to my attention.  I was so interested in the subject this summer I actually bought a few history books that was over that period of American history.  So much these days the media tends to negelect from everyone.  They could have incorporated something in this segement, however it was called "Boomtime" and not "freedom now"...

===message:I agree with what you said.  The economy was terrible before hand, the war scared alot of people.  After the war everyone was happy to be alive and ready for some good prosperous times.  People were willing to work together and achieve goals.

===message:I agree, the program left out the struggle of the civil rights movement. The civil rights movement was just as important as anything eles that happen in American history. But, many try to leave out or not try to focus on this country's harsh realities of its past.
