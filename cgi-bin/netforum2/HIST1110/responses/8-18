===message:I agree that propaganda played a major role in influencing the viewpoints of both the soviets and the U.S. The Soviets are right to believe that the U.S. is full of greedy people based on what they see through the media.  Also, the United States sees the soviets as a communist country because we have so much freedom that anyone who is not allowed to say certain things or do certain things seems to be evil.  If the radio and television reporters would report only the facts, and not try to influence its people, then the world could probably get along better.
