===message:I do not agree with you that a lot of people viewed WWI as a romantic past time.  Don't forget that there were wars before WWI and no war has ever been a romantic past time.  I do agree that any war is hard on the soldier's family; not knowing what shape their loved ones will be in when they return home....that is if they even make it back home.  This war was a horrible.  All types of poisonous gases were used and soldiers were subjected to the most sub-human conditions.  They were in the trenches for days and months.  During the first World War, soldiers could not wait to fight for their country.  They were eager to enlist because they were very patriotic and felt it was the right thing to do. Their families were even proud of them for wanting to go to war.......Things have really changed, today.  As for coping with the war, I suppose everyone copes in their own way.  Some people work hard, some keep in close contact with their friends, and some cope by being unfaithful to their spouses.

===message:I didn't understand your discussion answer. Apparently, I didn't interpret the war like you did. How could World War be viewed as a romantic past time especially when soldiers are being killed, missing in action, or missing body parts.
Fighting in Wars has many psychological effects mentally and physical. Not only do soldiers suffers but their families feels the affect also. So I don't see how this could be viewed as any romantic past time.

===message:In Keri defense when she said that people viewed the War as romantic, you can she what she was referring to when you watch the old movies. The women sitting bravely at home wrapping bandages, taking care of the children waiting for their loved ones to come home.  All movies about war shows the same image. A more recent movie "We were Soldiers" is a movie about Vietnam and it shows the wives at home supporting each other and helping each other bravely waiting for their husbands to come home until the telegrams start to arrive and then the realize that their husbands have died.

===message:When I say 'Romantic Past time'....NO one knew what war (that we know of it today) was like until this war.  This was the war where all of the new weapons (including poisonous gas) were exposed.  I agree with both of you who replied (and did not understand ‘Romantic Past Time’) on the type of chemical warfare etc.  One reason why people did not think of this war as the way we do, is when people fought wars back then they used to use a type of method called ‘guerrilla warfare’.  This is basically, if I am not mistaken, where men line up with two lines, facing each other, wait for the shout and then start charging.  (Examples Braveheart and even Lord of the Rings has a scene.)  But not in this war, guerrilla warfare was thrown out because the Central Powers thought it would be best to just ‘hold the ground’ they took.  Trenches were dug, underground housing developed, people waited for days to months at a time for the war to continue.  When I say ‘Romantic Past Time’ another good example of the meaning is like the other reply was, women, waiting for their ‘patriotic’ husbands, grief stricken and heartbroken.  (However it was just not the women, it was the country.)  Back in these days, one of the most important aspects of being a ‘normal’ citizen was to be extremely patriotic.  Women sort of just knew if a war broke out, more than likely their husbands, sons, and brothers were going to fight.  Up until this war, NOT for the U.S. however remembering the Civil War was fought just a few years earlier and it being still fresh on our minds (and this is one of the reasons the U.S. hesitated to embark on this war), no one took time to think about how drastically life had changed, i.e. how technology was developing rapidly, and no one took time to actually think war of all things could materialize.  (To put it on a basic level, it was as if we were sending blind men out to fight up against our army now, the only difference, no one knew we were sending out “dead men walking”.)  The U.S. knew devastation of war; we had seen it on our home front, so romantic does not apply to our country in this statement, (even though at battle of first Bull Run, there were even spectators until they realized how dangerous war could be).  War brought countries together, families together, bonds were formed.  Think of 9/11.  Didn’t your heart bleed for the families but most importantly, didn’t it make you feel PROUD to be an American?  Didn’t your feelings of hatred for our President and government disappear and some type of feeling, many of us have never experienced before, over take your body?  Was it pride or grief?  Hatred or sorrow?  Those feelings, that pride, the country’s bonding, that is what I mean when I say ‘Romantic Past Time’.

===message:Thanks Keri for explaining your meaning of "Romantic Past Time" and I agree with your definition. Even though today, we have different expression about war verse how people expresses their feelings in the past.
Men and women were proud for their husband and sons to fight in the war because they were fighting for our country just like the Vietnam war, they were our men of honor.
Since 9/11, we don't know what what kind of war we will be fighting next. We want our soldiers to fight for our country but we also don't want them to leave fearing that they may not return home.
Yes, you are right it is like sending out "dead men walking" no one knows what to expect next.
Yes, our heart did bleed for the American victims who died on September 11 and it still does.
Yes, we did feel hatred for our President and the government because they are the people with power and control, who suppose to protect our country. It was more hate than sorrow on September 11. Even though we are proud to be called Americans but I am more proud of those Americans who died on 9/11 that is my "Romantic Past Time."

===message:I think your paragraph was right on point when you said that the military leaders probably had no idea of the devastation these new "killing machines" were going to cause.  If you think about it they had not been used in such great numbers until World War I.  How could they have an idea about the amount of men that would be killed?

===message:I agree with what you said in your response, and the first thing that came to my was the movie that recently played in the movies called "We Were Soldiers." It shows how everyone was patriotic and eager to fight in what they believed in. The women sitting at home waiting for their husbands to come home... scared in a sense that they would not make it back but also very proud to have them defending what's right. A lot of them coped with what was going on by talking to eachother, thinking of the good times, staying postive about things, etc.

===message:People's emotions after war were very cynical towards the government.  They were convinced by the governments campaigns of propaganda and ended up causing detestment of political leaders.  I agree that the military leaders didn't realize with the invention of new weapons, how destructive this war was going to be.  Millions of people lost their lives because of national leaders thinking they could be dominant world figures.  They formed alliances with other countries that just gave them more fuel for the fire.  With this backing, they thought themselves to be invinceable.  WWI was pointless.  Soldiers had to cope with being in trenches, fighting battles for weeks and months at a time.  Civilians felt the impact of war when countries started cutting off trade(food supplies).  They were also faced with their loved ones at war and wondering if they were going to return.  Once the war ended, people thought that such a great war would eventually end in peace.  They thought the answer to preventing wars was a system based on worldwide revolution.  Little did they know it was only the beginning.
