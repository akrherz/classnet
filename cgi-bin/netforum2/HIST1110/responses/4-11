===message:Eric I think your comment about the President and congress in this new middle eastern war is right on point.  If the president and members of congress had to go to Iraq to fight, I dont think they would be quick to start this new war.  You would think our current president would have learned something from his father.  I wish the question posed to use would have been why do you think the Bush administration wants to go to war with Iraq again.  That would have been easier to answer.

===message:Eric, I also believe your commemts about the president and dpeaceful negotiations are right on point. Velkys, of course if the president and the rest of Congress were going to be the ones stnading on the front line, they wouldn't be so quick to go. It's not his or his family's life that he has to worry about. I think this war is a little more of a personal thing to the president. He wants to try to finish in sense what his father tried to do. And obviously he did not learn anything from his father because if he did then we would not be trying this now. Before they are able to make the ultimate decisions in whether we go to war or not they should first have to put on thier fighting gear and go out with bunch of military groups already out there.

===message:I obviously agree with both of you.  Perhaps if they paid attention to Eisenhower, they would realize to seek peace and not war.  War is the final answer.
