===message:Debbie, I think your message was great. Though I was born in 1983, in reading your message I could imagine the things that you wrote about. Also in a way I do know what you are talking about. I am Puerto Rican and when I was younger we would visit our family who lived in Puerto Rico. And even though they had washer machines and all the modern appliancs they still liked to do things the "old fashioned" way. My aunts would line-dry clothes except the days it was raining. They rasied chickens, pigs, grew friuts and vegetables. Back then I didn't competly understand and was impatient like most kids. But now I appreiate the things they did/do. Living in today's world just as in the 1950's there are/were advantages and disadvantages. For example, the technology is far better today, but there is not as much family time as back then.

===message:I remember some of the shows that you listed even though I'm a child of the 1960's but I catches some of the shows on Nick at Night. Those shows explain the idea family life and how the 1950s describes the perfect family. Those was the good old days, when the wife stayed home and the husband work. Now, their are two family income, more single parents working and raising their child(ren) by themselves. Also,there is higher unemployment and no life or medical insurance. Life was definitely easy then.

===message:Im a kid of the 60s to although alot of those shows you meantioned I have watched too. You have to admit life was good in the 50s for white america. There were strong family values. It seemed like no one had a care in the world. My brother is 13 years older then me so he grew up in the 50s. My parents had a house, and a car. My dad was the bread winner of the family and my mom stayed home and raised my brother. So they where they typical american family in the 50s I guess.

===message:I like your response. Even though there were many good times for people during the fifties. The fifties were hard on many minority citizens. But, we have came a long way since then and our country will only progress through the future.

===message:Life back in the fifties sounds amazing. To be able to allow my children to go outside and not have to worry who would try and kidnap them, to not hear a child disrespect an adult, to have homes with mostly moms and dads, to not have to worry about hazardous materials such as nuclear weapons, to just be able to grow up and become a productive member of society. There weren't as many "angry people" in the world. I try to imagine someone always willing to lend a hand to help a neighbor instead of turning his/her head and looking the other way.  To know that if you did something wrong the neighbor had the right to correct you and your parent would only uphold the neighbors decision instead of going to their house with a gun.  Life in the fifties seemed to be great.  Although, I'm sure that they had their own troubles, I can't imagine them being anything like what the world is going through now.  I think that the segment was accurate enough and makes me wish that I would have grown up in the peace and   tranquility. I only wish that they would have included more of the African American race so that I could see if life was better for them then.
