===message:Actually, many of the Soviets believed that their country was the most envied and prosporous nation in the world.  This can be mostly credited to Stalin's mass propoganda after WWII.  I agree that US citizens believed the Soviet people were under government control without any power for their future.

===message:I agree with your statement Janna. The Soviet people did think that their country was the most envied and that was due to Stalin's mass propaganda. Another reason that they felt that their life was better than the American people was because they felt their life was much more simple then the Americans. They felt like the whole capitalist system made the Americans greedy. Also they believed that the American people were racist and self-absorbed, only thinking about themselves. So it's not really that they envied the United States and the American people actually it's that they thought they were better off then them.

===message:I agree with your statement about the propaganda used by the Soviet Union and the United States.  Both countries painted their own countries as "Superpowers" of the world.  Both countries depicted themselves as leaders in industry and agriculture.  I dont agree with the statement that soviet citizens envied american citizens.  They may have longed for more of the freedoms that Americans had in their everyday lives.  The little information the soviets received about americans was filtered in through the communist government.  As you stated, the soviets saw the prosperous lives of americans through propaganda, the lives only a few americans actually experienced.  The soviet citizens could not have been envious of the american way of life that did not really exist for all americans.

===message:I don't think that most Soviets envied life in America.  To an extent some Soviet citizens may have.  But when the populous is fed a steady diet of taboo and stigma towards the U.S. and a sense of praise and the hope of better days to come under their current rule, their perception is framed, and any evidence supporting their imposed ideas is magnified.  Trends show that each generation is brought up with a set of beliefs or"theme"which is influenced by the events of their time.  So to those coming up in the communist nation, nothing was worse than to be an American.  Evidence of this can be seen in conflicts today as the generation of Muslims brought up on the belief that the U.S. is the constant enemy and must be uprooted from muslim territories has produced an arsenal of ready and willing suicide bombers who give the precious gift of life due to these "framed" beliefs.  And the kids coming up today in America face the challenge of viewing Muslims and Islam free from any negative stereotypes due to current events.  So in closing I think the Soviets were not allowed room to envy another way of life due to the stronghold the regime had on information.

===message:I agree that the Soviets were led to believe their country was the greatest by Stalin. The huge amount of negative propaganda that was spread over the Soviet country led them to believe American citizens were greedy and self-involved.

===message:American and Russian governments were just too curious about what each other was doing or going to do.  They did not have any  trust between them, hence they started feeding their citizens falsehood about the other country. I think the Russians became too suspicious of America because of the "Marshall plan" that was implemented partly to alleviate people's sufferings post war,and to advance democratic ideals. The partitioning of Germany into East and West, and the air lift of supplies to West Germany showed the fierce struggles between the USA and USSR.

===message:I agree with most of what you said in your original message except the fact that the United States wanted peace with the Soviets.  I think America wanted Russia to back down from trying to control Europe.  No where has it been brought to my attention that the United States was trying to make peace.  They wanted control and Russia was willing to give in, therefore, the start of mass propaganda and the Cold War.
