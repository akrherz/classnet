===message:You made a really good point about pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiation. I really liked the way you made sure to discuss each concept separately. That is something that many of us fellow classmates did not do, but maybe should have. I learned a lot through reading your discussion; it really provoked a lot of thought. I agree that these three peace-pursuing ideas sound great in theory, but when we take them and compare them to real-life situations (as you did in your discussion of Sadam Hussain and peaceful negotiation ), we can then see their faults so much more clearly and realize that as long as people will be unpredictable and  uncontrollable, so will be the outcomes of policies like pacifism, disarmament, and negotiation.

===message:I do agree with the points that you came up with. When leaders try to negotiate it does just buy more time. Because soon as one leader goes against something made in the negotiations, war will be declared. Or the leaders may not agree with each other on one simple term and they will have negotiations after negotiations, until finally they discover that they cannot agree with each other, and war is declared. So to negotiate is just a waste of time.
