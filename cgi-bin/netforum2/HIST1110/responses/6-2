===message:It's true the sporting industry is America's favorite pasttime because our initial interest in it was due to a need for a resurgence of American strength and recognition.  Sports was a form of nationalism that help many cope with the hardships of their era.

===message:Many forget the purpose of sports.  The entire premise is entertainment.  Since people have began enjoying sports it was only for entertainment.  Athletes, musicians, or any other celebrity are not role models because they chose to be.  This is their profession-something they all excel at- and many fans forget that they are human.  These men and women, particularly athletes, sometimes become involved in illegal or immoral situations and make mistakes just like everyone else.  Even in the twenties, athletes were not tremedous role models.  Take Babe Ruth; he was one of the worst men one could emulate.  He drank heavily, chain-smoked cigars and cigarettes, ate like a glutton, and bore a few illegitimite children.  However, This man played baseball better than anyone before him.  This is what fans cared about.  Sure, people liked hearing some stories about his social life, but many focused on his tremendous athletic talent.  Sports symbolizes the rise to greatness that America embodies.  The hard work and dedication that all professional athletes experience during their rise to the top.  The outside life of a player should never be more scrutinized than our own.
