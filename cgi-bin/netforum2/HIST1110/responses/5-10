===message:President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal created a government role in the economic life of Americans.  Upon inauguration in 1933, Mr. Rooselvelt entered with confidence that his New Deal would work where Hoover's plan's and Congressional plans had not.  Most of the new deal became effective within the first 100 days of office.  Immediatly instilling confidence in the American people, Roosevelt caputured the love of the American public as a hero.  Many poverish-stricken individuals were restored with confindence in the National Government.  They began to trust banks with the creation of the FDIC program.  Pressure was eased off of the banking industry and workers began to find more jobs due to increased union protection.  Minimum wage also served the workers better jobs and afforded more rights, especially in the blue collar industries.  
    Roosevelt's New Deal did not, however, save the country.  By the end of the 1930's, seven years of the plan, American's were still in trouble.  According to the text, "In 1939, unemployment remained at 17 percent."  Even President Roosevelt admitted, "One third of Americans remained 'ill housed, ill fed, ill clad.'"  Not until the war did American pull itself out of the depression. In effect, the New Deal did little more that drum up hope.  The activity by the government in promoting employment and reinstilling faith to the public created positive public opinion.  The New Deal restored confinence in the American Psyche, and by those means was effective.

===message:Good response Keith and I agree 100%. Besides, Franklin gave us Eleanor, who was a great lady in spite of those sensible shoes. Not content with planting memorial shrubs, she was even more of a reformer then he was; in fact, some people called her a communist – an understandable mistake, given her holier-than-thou attitude. Actually, it was probably the closest we ever had to a king and queen. Or to a pair of kings, but let’s leave Eleanor’s sexual preference out of this shall we? This was more a partnership than a marriage, really, and sometimes it seemed more like a rivalry than either. But isn’t that, after all, the American way?

===message:I have to admit that prior to this class I did not know that the depression occured in any other country except the United States.  It did not dawn on me, that just as the condition of our economy now affects the entire world it would have also done so in the 1930's.  It was especially interesting for me to learn how it affected countries in Latin America.  My family is from Panama, but most of them came from other areas of the caribbean and latin america to get jobs building the canal.  I would have loved to ask my grandparents about that era and how the depression affected them.

===message:I would also have to agree that I did not realize how the Great Depression affected many other places in the world besides the United States. It was interesting to see that everyone everywhere was pretty much going through the same thing and having the same kind of issues. It was especially interesting to me when after reading the chapters and watching the video the different ways in which each country dealt with the Depression. How the leaders tried to resolve their economic stress and what methods they used whether it was a communistic, democratic, socalistic, or facsist approach.Also whether or not the method prevailed. Like Velky, my family is also from the Carribean and I wonder how did they deal with the Depression in Puerto Rico.

===message:I guess that I am following the leader on saying that I had no clue that other countries were affected by the Great Depression.  After reading the responses about talking to family members, I had to call my grandfather.  It was interesting to me that they were farmers at the time of the Depression and did not really suffer.  Of course, this raised my curiosity because it was my understanding that farmers were devestated by the depression.  My grandfather stated that the only reason that they were not truly affected was because his father was a miser with money.  All of their equipment was paid for and the money they did have saved up was not in the bank.  Another aspect that helped them from poverty was (and this was not a good thing by any means) the destruction of the farmers around their area.  The other farmers would come to work with my grandfather for food and a little bit of money and in turn, they received labor to help sustain the farm.  I guess that putting the "cash under the matress" was a good thing for that period of time.

===message:People was definately looking for anyone to stand up with a different idea that may have a positive outcome.  Roosevelt was at the right place at the right time.  I think politics may have played a key part.  The people were looking at the other political party for a change.
