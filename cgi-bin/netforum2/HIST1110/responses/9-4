===message:It is true; the 1950s' was a time of plenty for many  Americans.  The economy was good and many people used that opportunity to get good jobs, buy houses, buy cars, migrated to areas of no or low crime rates, and the standard of living for the privileged became high.  However, those not privileged were not able to afford most of those "goodies"  because they could not get good or high paying jobs, or were left out in the distribution of resources at that time.

===message:So, the Fifties were clearly a decade of the birth of "plastic" spending. Do you think of this as an advance or a setback for America. I understand that it was known as a time of new prosperity, but I often wonder whats so great about credit....it seems to be the source that feeds our impatient desires to have what we can't realistically have  right now. It seems totally necessary to be able to finance a house or a car, but it makes you wonder just how closely correlated materialism is with credit spending.

===message:What do you think though was missing in the segement?  You did however teach me something in your dicussion, I did not know the Diner's Club was the first credit card.  I work in a resturant and have been given a Diner's Club card ONCE in my 4 years of serving.  For them to have been around for so long, you would think they would be more popular than the everyday Credit cards you see now.

===message:I agree with your response.  Yes, the people did want to be in surburbia and own their own homes.  A friend of mine who lived in the fifties parents paid $16,000.00 for a 3 bedroom but were fortunate enough to have a Diner's Club card.  They grew their own food and raised chickens.  A great advantage for people being able to purchase their homes in the 50's was the advents of the FHA and the VA with their low-interest loans.  Many young white couples moved to the suburbs to escape city life for the safety and good educational areas leaving the inner cities to the disadvantaged.

===message:The video provided an insight into the lives of post-war Americans.  The baby boom had begun and proseperity was more widespread than ever before.  With the manufacturing industry booming because of increased productivity, a generation raised through the Depression and World War I began to buy conveince items that would be unheard of during the past twenty years.  This unbelieveable prosperity extended itself into every facet of the Amercian lifestyle: more cars, swimming pools, dishwashers, washing machines, and new homes.  In Levitstown, NY, it was said that builders were finishing forty homes per day in the early fifties.  The suburban migration had begun.  Expansionary monatary policy allowed banks to provide low interest lows for mortgages, equity loans, and credit cards.  The golden age of American had begun, when Americans could not afford, they borrowed.  But this may be a portrayal of middle class white America.  The video neglected to depict minority lifestlye of the 1950's.  One would wonder if the minority post-war expierence could compare to the suburban white prosperity.
