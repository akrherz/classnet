===message:Although episode 13 depicts the life of the American family as one in which the father worked and mothers stayed at home, this depiction is only a representation of the prosporous white American family.  It is important to understand that before the 1950's, during the 1950's, and today, most African-American women had a dual function as both mother in the home and as a financial provider.

===message:I agree with your statement. I wonder since everyone was benefiting from the boom time effect and since the African Americans, other minorities, and the elderly wasn't mention did they prosperous at all.

===message:Veronica, that was a good question you asked. I would also like to know the answer to that. I am guessing that a very very few minorities may have prospered, but nobody that is really heard about. And not to the extent of the White people. Also, if they did prosper I wonder if they had to assimilate theirselves to be like the whites and give up their culture(s).

===message:I've often wondered the same thing.  I think for the most part many people were ignorant and racists during that era.  It is unfortunate that things were that way.  I hope that as more and more time goes by all Americans will join together as one and forget about what color someone is.  It is not right at all.  Many people today are just a prejudice as those in the 1950's and it needs to stop!!!  I would like to add that I am a white person that has a best friend who is black.  She has been a better friend to me than any of my white friends ever thought of being.
