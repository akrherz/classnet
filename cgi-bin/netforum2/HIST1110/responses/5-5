===message:Thanks for your opinions.  I agree with the fact that most Americans were pretty much ready for any means to get the US out of the Depression.  However, President Roosevelt's New Deal was the primary factor in creating jobs and financial restoration for America.  The institution of new programs and acts under the New Deal can not be ignored.  Yes, pre-war re-armament also gave a boost to the economy by adding more jobs, but the New Deal was set in place before this occurred.  The New Deal was more to people than just empty promises because Americans were actually seeing and reaping the benefits of it.  Without the New Deal, American's would still have gone back to work due to WWII, but they would not have the faith and confidence in their government needed to sustain soldiers on the warfront.

===message:Janna, I disagree with you stance on the New Deal.  The New Deal was not the primary factor in ending the depression.  In 1939, more then six years of Roosevelt's plan had resulted in a unemployment rate of 17%( Findley 117).  Only the new production boom as a result of the war created jobs for Americans.  This production boom was not employing the reminents of unemployed, but the majority of them.  Roosevelt did, however create some beneficial institutions such as the FDIC, SEC, and NLRB, but he also set the country on a dangerous track toward socailism.  I do not believe that the New Deal is socialist in itself, as the income collection statistics on page 118 prove.  But by beginning the precedenting the practice of deficit borrowing, we have created dangerous spending habits.  The government is a business, and if a business were run like the government it would probably fold quickly.  The New Deal did little more than drum up confindence in the American government by a lot of empty political activity.  Proponants of the New Deal saw Roosevelt as a hero, realizing his aid and support for the common man, not realizing that "ordinary people actually benefited little.  It was the big farmers...who were helped by govenment managment of the marketplace" (Findley 118).

===message:I agree that by the time Roosevelt and his administration came up with the New Deal the American people were ready for some sort of action.  Americans were not use to any sort of intervention by the government in economic affairs.  These government programs were partly viewed as successful because the public was so, as you stated, ready for just about anything.

===message:Keri, you are definitely right when you said, “… Americans were ready for ANYTHING to make their lives better.”  However, President Roosevelt portrayed himself as a “next door neighbor” type of guy.  So with that type of charisma it was evident that his “fireside chats” would build the people’s confidence for their government.  Wouldn’t you?  The New Deal provided some jobs.  I believe it was the starting point of the recovery.  Just like Janna stated, “faith and confidence in their government needed to sustain soldiers on the warfront.”  Soldiers need a reason to fight for their countries.  Why support a government that’s not doing anything for their people.   Therefore, President Roosevelt did as much as he could do and the people saw his efforts.  His efforts gave soldiers a reason to fight for their country.
