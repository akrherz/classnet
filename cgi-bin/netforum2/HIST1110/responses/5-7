===message:The New Deal called for both economic and social programs. Among the first measures passed by Congress were laws to restore confidence in banks. The Emergency Banking Relief Act, for example, provided for the reopening of some banks under federal supervision. Another banking laws, the Glass-Steagall Act, enable the government to guarantee deposits of up to $5,000 for each customer. To reduce unemployment, a new government agency, the Work Progress Administration(WPA), was established. The WPA put millions of people to work on projects such as building bridges, highways, and dams. In addition, the Civilian Construction Corps provided work for thousands of unemployed youths. The Federal government also provided relief funds to states so they could give money to the needy. Along with these measures, which eased some of the suffering caused by the Great Depression, the New Deal included social programs. Congress enacted the Social Security Act. It provided old-age benefits and a system of unemployment insurance. The National Labor Relations Acts encouraged union organization and collective bargaining. As a result, workers won increased job benefits.
The New Deal had broken business dominance of national politic and acted as a broker for various organized interest groups, representing agriculture and labor as well as business. In 1935, New Deal strategists reached beyond organized groups to address the fears and grievances of a far broader spectrum of the American people, from sharecroppers to mothers with dependent children. Under the New Deal, the lives of many ordinary people improved. Yet Roosevelt's programs did not restore prosperity to the United States.
Unemployment remained high until another world war broke out in Europe in 1939. Whether or not the New Deal was success is still much debated. However, it resulted in the Federal government playing a far larger role than ever before in a peace time economy.

===message:Melanie, I agree that President Roosevelt’s New Deal came about at the right time since it was right before World War II.  World War II demanded such a large workforce and the people were ready and eager for work.  This demand for employees was what really jumpstarted the economy and got people spending again.  In addition, certain legislation that was passed such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also helped instill confidence of the American public in the economic system and banks.  President Roosevelt also created the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) which hired young men to work on how to improve the American environment.
