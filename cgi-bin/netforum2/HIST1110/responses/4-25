===message:You summed it all up.  Wars are started because of different reasons; may be due to political, economical, religious beliefs, show of power, etc. We are also very aware that pacificism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiations cannot always stop wars from happening because people have different agendas, and once they start war people will fight to defend themselves.

===message:I also agree, war is unavoidable.  The fact is that arms will always exist.  Once a given country disarms another will pick up where they left off and propose a threat to the rest of the world.  Lets face it.  War is an economic booster.  Countries know and use this to thier advantages.  There is always someone to fight and the powerful want to keep their power.
