===message:The Great War was just the beginning of the wars that lie ahead of the world and at that, the most important event of a lifetime for many.  This was the most destructive war the world has ever known.  It was not the ‘end of all wars’ nor was there an explanation needed, except to Americans, but this war began over irrational problems between the countries of Europe.  When a Serbian student terrorist assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungry in Sarajevo, a place most Americans had never heard of, it produced a series of events that lead to WWI.  The leaders of The Central Powers were determined to punish Serbia, and Russia was their ally.  (That was how Russia was brought in).  Austria-Hungry & Germany were considered the Central Powers in this war where Britain, France and Russia were the Allied Powers.  England hesitated in the beginning, but when Germany invaded Belgium in order to attack France, England declared war and the annihilation of Europe began.  If I am not mistaken, because this book is awful, this is why the war began.  It was not the end of all wars, only the beginning because of the mass destruction which most of the world was involved in for the first time.  (Let’s not forget WWII which the most world was also involved in.)

===message:Well put, Keri. And , incidentally, I do agree that the book is terrible. There is entirely too much crammed into each section. For example, the chapter on what appears to be about Russia, extends into Mao and Chinese nationalism and other Asian factions. This could easily be an entire separate chapter. The textbook reads much like a book I once labored through. It was on the complete history of WWII. Even being a WWII enthusiast, I found it to be terribly confusing because it examined the politics, arsenal, morale, strategy, historical consequences, as well as land, sea, and air tactics of the war in both theaters. This was all great information but the author chose to disclose it all simultaneously. After about 800 pages, I had lost much of the information in the constant zig-zagging from topic to topic. That seems to be this author’s modus operandi as well. Two Thumbs Down!
