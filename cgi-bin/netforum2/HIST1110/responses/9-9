===message:Keri, We have an easy life now?  My good friend that is in her sixties and went through school and college during the fifties.  She was able to walk anywhere at night unafraid, could leave her house and car doors unlocked.  Granted she lived in a small town but there was no fear of being harmed.  She could walk over two miles to and from school unaccompanied.  Her family was small and she was the only child but she and her family did things together such as, picnics and vacations.  They ate all of their meals together.  Her parents did not own a T.V. until she was sixteen years old.  Although they had a T.V. they watched only a few programs that were family oriented.  She did not have to contend with violence, drugs, and was not exposed to "in your face sex."  Many people that grew up during the fifties have remarked that the it was a wonderful time to grow up.  Although I didn't experience the fifties to make my own comparison, I will have to admit that I would rather be living in that era than the one that we are in now.

===message:I appreciate and agree with your reply Debbie.  You are so right.  You would think our lives would become easier as time moves on but it’s not.  Life in the 50s was about materialism, which is getting worse everyday.  Back then materialism included household appliances to make daily chores easier.  But today, it’s about the amount of cars, size of house, brand name clothes, etc that people are going out of their ways to get.  It’s gotten to a point where parents are not spending enough time with kids or people killing each other for them.

===message:To clarify what I mean by how we have life easier…I can travel all over the world at the click of a button.  I can e-mail the world for free instead of standing in line at the post office to pay unreasonable prices for stamps.  In 2008, I can take a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer.  I can shop this holiday season, online, SAVE gas, time, and stress of the effort of getting in all of the holiday rush.  I believe we have it much easier than anyone else that has walked this earth before us.  Technology, medicine, and science have created a world of incredible vastness.  There is so much I can do, want to do, have done that many people of the 50’s growing up have only dreamt of.  I lived in England and went to school for 6 months when I was 20.  I have been to 23 states and 4 countries and not even 25.  I can handle the sex in your face and the drugs because of how I was raised and my beliefs.  For the people in the 50’s, maybe they had it better in some aspects of their life, but for me, I am extremely grateful that God has given me an opportunity to live in this immensely fast pace, growing world.  With a blink of the eye and a click of a button, we have it easier than any generation before us.

===message:I understand where everybody is coming from. I think both back then and now had/has it's advantages and disadvantages. I think it was a good time back then because children could play outside and parents would not have to worry about them getting kidnapped, people back then generally had more family quality time than now. There were many good points back then and are a lot of good points 
about now including the technology, vaccines, etc. I think both aspects of life then and now should be apprecated.
