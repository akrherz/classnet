===message:I agree with the fact that our lives now are better than life was 100 years ago. This had to do with the major breakthroughs in virtually all works of life.  Let me also comment that good things of life come with their little disavantages.  These disadvantages, I think we will continue to try to find ways to make right.  But on the overall, life now is better than ever before.
