===message:I agree!  Technological advances have lengthened our life span and have given us more convenience, but instead of using the spare time we have as quality time with our families, we seem to have cluttered it with other things like TV and late nights at the office.  A hundred years ago, mothers stayed home with their children.  Now, even if mothers wanted to stay home with their children chances are they couldn’t afford to.  Also, the computer was initially supposed to reduce the amount of paper we use and save trees, but I think we use more paper now than before.  Still, it's difficult to imagine life without cars, cell phones, and computers.

===message:   I agree with most of what you state in your answer but must disagree with your comments on the workload of today as it compares with that of 100 years ago. Because of the formal attire, mass immigration, and simple black and white photos, I think it is easy to draw the conclusion that "life was simpler back then" or "life was more pure then". However, what the video did not discuss were the children who’s families pulled them from school to pick cotton or harvest crops. It did not allude to the child-labor laws that had to be implemented to restrict the enormous number of youths working in sweat-shops. Nor did it discuss fathers who worked sun-up to sun-down to bring home money that almost never was sufficient. 
	I think, however, that what HAS changed about our family values is the slow decline in standards. For example, divorce is now an acceptable way to solve differences, day care centers are now in charge of raising millions of children, and the current misconception that being a single mother - raising a child - is somehow an empowering "adventure".

===message:I have to agrre with Debbie.  We look at the old black and white photos and say look at how simple their lifes were, but what the picture doesn't show is all the work that went in to making that picture possible.  They didn 't have the luxuries that we have today.  Alot of their clothes were made by hand and most people rasied their own food sources.  Men worked long days in the feild while the famales tended to the children and all the house work.  All this they did without the modern conviences that we have today.
