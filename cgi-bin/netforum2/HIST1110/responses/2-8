===message:I do agree with your statement that minorites and women have it much better now than a century ago.  I disagree that these groups as you stated can "work wherever" they would like.  Their are still several professions that are exclusively caucasian and male.  Many jobs in the military are still excluded to women.  Think of all these major corporations that are now being investigated by the government for fraud in their accounting practices.  When you watch the news, read the paper, or even look on the internet do you remember any of the people being questioned by congress being non-white or female?
