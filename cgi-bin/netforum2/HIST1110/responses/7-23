===message:Stephenie, I agree with most of what you stated, but you if can remember white Americans did kill many people who were not white. People were beatened to death, churches and houses were bombed, and African Americans were slaves for the longest time. Now does that not sound a little bit like what Hitler was trying to do? Though it did not go as far as genocide(like Hitler tried to do with Jewish people)but it was devastating enough. The true Americans that were here first were the Native Americans and look what hapened to them, the were forced to leave their homes, kept as slaves, and also killed. I agree with you that our world today is based mostly on beauty and fitness, that's all you see in the movies and in magazines. And yes I also believe as you do that everyone is part of one race.... the human race.

===message:Ebony, you are absolutely right.  Americans did slaughter and kill many people who were not of the white race.  I guess I did not add that in my initial response.  I was just trying to state that while Americans do share similiar traits with the Germans, I do not believe that their intentions were to exterminate everyone who was not white.  Yes, punishments and killings were brought upon those that were not white, but never with the intention of wiping out the entire "other" race population.  Even though the world is by far a perfect place, it is nice to know that, for the most part, people are all trying to get along.  Hopefully in the next 50 years we can see racism diminish totally.  I just hope that is not wishful thinking!

===message:I also agree with you on what you just said but I must ask you. What were white peoples intentions then? They thought that nobody was better than them, and I believe that if they could of had it there way then yes they would have wiped out blacks, native americans, hispanics, etc. I also hope that in the next 50 years racism is wiped out, and hopefully it is not just wishful thinking by you, me, and many other people in this world.

===message:What were the intentions of the whites?  I don't really know.  But I believe that white people killed most black people to show their "power."  I don't think that white people were trying to wipe out the African American people because they were slaves doing the manual labor of the white man.  If whites were trying to wipe out the black population, who would have tended to the farms and homes? I hardly doubt it would have been the rich plantation owner. It would have been some other unfortunate soul. In the case of Native Americans, I believe that whites were trying to cease the land.  I don't think the intention again was to kill off the population of Native Americans, but only to improperly take land that was not theirs.
