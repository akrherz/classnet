===message:I understand and agree with what you are saying. I also work at a public school in the after school program, and notice all the discipline problems amongst the children. I do believe that parents today spend less time with their children. It is not because they want to but because they have to. Today's technology has made our economy rise and because of that cost of living has gone up. When parents come in to pick up their children from the program they are constantly asking us to please make sure their child does his/her homework and also if we can check the answers for them. Their reason is also because when they get home from work they are too tired or still do not have enough time due to cooking dinner, cleaning up, etc. If we were to ask ever child in the program would they rather: watch t.v., do homework, play outside, or do arts and crafts they will almost always pick either watching t.v. or going outside. As soon as the t.v. is turned on the room goes from screaming and jumping around to total silence, so then you wonder is this what happens at home. Many parents may tell their children to have good values and morals but the children will not understand less their parents sit down with them explain it. As people we need to remember that even though technology is very important in our lives we need to take time for what should be more important...family.

===message:Yes you are so right. I remember when I was in school my mom did not work. When I came home it was change your clothes, get a snack and play for a bit. Then after that it was sit down at the kitchen table and check through your work and do homework, and you sat there until it was done. There where no video games, computers, ect. Today parents don't have that kind of time so they rely on whatever outside help they can get. They send them to school and want the schools to discipline them.  So by the time you get done with all the discipline, you hardly have any time left to teach.  I was subbing for a 6th grade class and I had to read their science material to them. Over half the class could not read it.  Its  so very sad. 

As technology has advanced and we have advanced through the years as a people, so has the cost of living gone up. The total economy of the world has change greatly in the past 100 years. We saw the generation of "latch-key" kids come into play. Our children while they benefit greatly from the advancements in medicine and technology have suffered greatly as a result of this also. I am sure if you compared this generations children’s test scores, SAT, scores ect, with say 20 or 30 year ago, we have fallen considerably. With all this technology so readily at our disposal our children should be advancing. Just yesterday I heard on the news that Georgia is #50 in the nation with the lowest SAT scores.

===message:You have hit the nail on the head about today's children in public schools.  I have worked in an elementary school for six years and I am floored everyday by the poor  behavior, lack of respect, and lack of interest in their studies.  Of course, this is not all their fault.  Many parents of today are to blame.  Which just goes back to things such as the dysfunctional families of today. Be it a one parent or two parent family today, the children are in control......not the parents.  So much emphasis on technology has been placed on the "curriculum" at school such as computer lab, closed circuit classrooms, etc. that children don't know how to just sit down and do their work with good ole paper and pencil.  They don't need to know how to do math without using some type of machine.  Another example is the digital clock.  You would be amazed at the number of children that can't tell time on a face clock because of this.  I could go on and on about this, but I won't.

===message:You make some valid points Gena and Debbie. Too many families in society today worry more about the monetary things in life rather than the family itself. Subsequently in many cases, both parents work to satisfy these needs. As a result, someone else (often no one) is left with the responsibility of providing the children with good morals, principles, and more importantly, love. Far more important than economics and demography are problems of moral decline and cultural suicide in this country. One of the manifestations of this decline consists of family decay, which includes an increased rate of divorce, illegitimacy, teen-age pregnancy, and single-parent families. The future health of this country, to some degree, depends on its success in coping with this trend. By no means am I advocating chauvinism, yet it is a fascinating fact that all of the psychoanalytic theories on child development from mainstream theorists identify the mother as central to child development. The original ideas (one hundred years old) about psychological development, which call for the total attention and affection of the mother for the infant, have continued to hold center stage. What’s so bad about the women’s traditional place in the family, or even Dad’s?

===message:Funny you should mention the clock. I had to sub for a 4th grade class I think it was in April of this year. One of things I had to go over with them was telling time with a clock. They had a worksheet which ask them to place the big hand and little hand on certain times. They all had a little clock to use. Over half of them could not do this.

We have made many of scientific and medical advances but you are right we have traded one thing for another.  In order to have a thriving society the mental health and the physical health of a person needs to be good.  We should try to allow an adult or a student to try to self-actualize himself on Maslow's pyramid of human needs.

About the public schools lets look at it from a students perspective. I am 23 years old by the way. The school I went to was not that good for the following reasons.  1.  The bathrooms in the schools do not have any doors in the stalls of the bathrooms so I cannot use the bathroom in peace.  2.  During class periods all the bathrooms are locked except the top floor so that means if a student has to go real bad he or she has to maybe race from the vocational building all the way to the top floor of the main building.  3.  The school system is about comformity and control meaning everything has to be done the teacher's way even though your way may be better and more efficient.  For instance do you know Albert Einstein was a great mathamatical genius but he failed alegbra in school.  The problem was that he did alegbra a different way than the instructor wanted him to do it.  He couldn't see it the instructor's way.  He saw it a different way.  The point I am making is that the public schools are a one size fits all package and do not allow room for creativity and free thought.

===message:Debbie, I do agree on your statement about how children are in control due to the lack of respect, poor behavior, and the lack of interest in their studies.
I won't put all the blame on parents, but I do put some of the blame on our government on how parents suppose to be raising their children and teaching our children.
So much emphasis on tecnology has been placed on the "curriculm", not the old-fashion learning that we grew up with in the 70s and 80s everything is computerize even the test we take.
Government has put so much emphasis on education they are even telling us how we should teach our children.  But if the children are not on level of the education learning the government places the blame on the teachers as well as the parents. We need to stop blaming each other, we all need to work together, the government, the teacher, and the parents need to help reform our students for better education.
Parents do not have the power to discipline their children for their behavior given the children the power saying child abuse, which focus lack of respect in the home as well in the school.
The teachers do not have any power in the classroom due to the lack of respect and poor behavior of that child because the teacher is constantly spenting their day dealing with behavior instead of teaching their class which is interfering with those students who do want to learn. I also learned what causes a lot of students to express a lack of interest in their studies, a lot has to due with personal problems at home or learning problems with themselves which causes their behavior in the classroom.
The parent and teacher relationship is not the same as it was in the past.  Most parents (single or two families)are working and the children are coming home from school to an empty house and some are even raising themselves, without any structure or guidance at home with only the television or video games as baby sitters. 100 years ago parents could sit down at the dinner table together, dad work and mother greeted the children when they came home from school. 
Since, I too work in the school system, I can count on my hand, how many parents values their children education and working with their child teachers. The Federal government is taking control of how we manage our school house, they is always looking at the picture from the outside instead of the true picture, just like the educational program,
"No Child Left Behind" that has been implemented to increase learning. They need to find out why the students education level is low and stop placing so much emphasis on technology. Classroom knowledge comes first, technology knowledge is second. We first need to know how to read and write in order to understand our technology world, so if we go back to the old teaching patterns I'm sure our educational level will rise to a high margin.

===message:I appreciate all that has been stated.  However, I believe that attributing technological advancement to the degradation of children's behavior in public schools is not necessarily realistic.  Technology definitely has had an impact on our culture, norms, and values especially in the educational arena.  But looking from a separate point of view, maybe these changes are a result of economic issues rather than technological concerns.  In conclusion, although there are many drawbacks, we are in a better living situation than a century ago.
