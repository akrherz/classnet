===message:The rural areas did not attempt to keep up with the boom age until the 1970's.  Many places didnt have a decent appliance until the late 60's.  The tape did depict the "common" household pretty accurately obsessed with not having to live in poverty.  The country encourage spending and promated a better economy.
