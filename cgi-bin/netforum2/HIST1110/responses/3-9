===message:Maybe the war was pointless to some people living around the world, but Wars in general are never pointless.  (Someone has to have a good reason to bomb another country.)  I do agree many innocent men lost their lives.  This was probably the first time that people begin to distrust their government.  It did open up the world’s eyes of the mass destruction and deaths, but after the war was over, when it was too late.  You made a few good statements and I agree with your comments about the War.

===message:Just from reading everyone's response to the question, I can tell that everyone certainly has their own opinion, including myself, of how people really viewed World War I.  It's all hindsight bias.  If only they knew then what we know now, things may have been done differently.  From viewing the video, it appeared to me that the American soldiers seemed "fired up" about going to war, but after our involvement they had a change of attitude.  You are exactly right about people paying a lot closer attention to their governments. Just like today, many things are covered up, or not told, by the government.  Civilians not only had to keep a close eye on the government, but had to trust that their government would not get them involved in any other wars unless there was an immediate threat to their homefront.

===message:I have to agree with everyone having their own opinion.  It is true that this war showed people that they need to keep a close eye on their government and other governments around the world.  This war showed how that things happening in other countries can and do have an affect on other countries.  I think that this war and the out come of this war is one of the reasons the United States did not entered World War II until we were attacked.  During the first war we lost a lot of lives and we didn't want to lose any more unless it was necessary.

===message:Yes – the war caused a mass number of people to distrust the political leaders and their motives.  If the masses were like sheep beaconing to the propaganda during the war; they weren’t the same innocent believing sheep after the war.  I have to agree that this war was pointless.  The only point that seems to have been made is to show how arrogant and hateful humanity can act towards themselves and their inability to settle disagreements in a more dignified and intelligent way.

===message:I agree with most of the statements that were made about the war; that people viewed war to be negative, the millions of soldiers that were killed, etc. But I do not believe that this was a pointless war. Everyone has their own reason for doing the things that they do, and the reasons might be pointless to other people. Because we live in a nation that gives us the right to do as we please who is to say that correct way of doing things and who is to say that it isn't? I strongly do agree though that after this war people did closely watch their government and probably criticize everything that they did. Just like now we watch every step that the president makes; applauding what he does right and critique the things we think are wrong.

===message:WWI left a bad taste in everyone's mouths.  The young soldiers that had to become men lost their innocence.  Many were killed and trained to kill.  The civilians began to live in poverty due to the inflation the war caused.  Both had to endure famine because of trade being cut off between the countries.  The political leaders really didn't gain any ground, their dreams of being a world power still weren't fulfilled.  Military leaders didn't know of the destruction that would occur.  No one was happy with the outcome of war.  No ground was gained.  To keep war from happening again, I think people were less enclined to believe political or military leaders.  They wouldn't fall for the same thing twice, so as long as they didn't show their governments support, they wouldn't have to endure war again.

===message:Political leaders will always censor information in order to project whatever image they are trying to achieve. Fortunately, today we have so much news coverage, that we are able to get the true story and not some painted picture. During WWI, the politicians and military leaders could lead the American people to believe whatever the wanted. This covered up a lot of the atrocities that were resulting from the war. However, when the war was over and the number of dead and injured was realized, the “blindfold” was removed from people’s eyes. War normally does result from an inability to settle differences between entities. Sometimes war is inevitable, because the protection of innocent people is important. It is difficult to sit back and watch a powerful entity take advantage of a weaker entity, when we have the power to help.
