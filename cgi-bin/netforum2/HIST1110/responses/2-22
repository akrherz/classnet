Having computers and mechanical devices to do are work for us leaves us not using our minds and bodies as much as we did in the past. With machines doing the work, we don't have to think about all components of the task. I feel a lot of lay - offs would not occur if not for our present technology. But people can argue against that point as well. For instance, I remember when people were scared the lifts on the garbage trucks were going to take away jobs. I still see the same number of people on the trucks.Three. The driver, and two people on the back.

Through these advances we were able to find vaccines for dieases, create relations with other countries and foreign business to provide more jobs in this country, also we have created and improved inventions such as the the car, telephone, indoor plumbing, electricity, & etc, to make life easier for people to live. People are definatly living longer, healthier, and happier lives than 100 years ago.
