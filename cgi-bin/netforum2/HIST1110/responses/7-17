===message:Tonya, I would like to ask you about the statement in your discussion about "americans not being as outward about their feelings as the germans" what exactly did you mean by that? Did you mean their feelings in the past or their feelings now?  Dont you think the policy of segregation of the races was a manifestaion of americans feelings of racial superiority?
