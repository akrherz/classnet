===message:I agree most people in the 1950s was propersing better than they had ever dream about. They were able to afford houses, cars, and top brand appliances. The people didn't have to worry about being laid off of their jobs because the economy was booming and people were needed.
But other Americans in the South was fighting a different battle unemployment and equal rights. Europeans was dying of stavation and unemployment until the Marshall Plan came into the existence. So it took awhile for everyone to reap the fruit of a better ecomony.

===message:I think the BOOM TIME reiterates the fact that the twentieth century is characterized by global interrelatedness.  The Marshall Plan realized the need for economic aid in Europe and that Americans had the ability to provide such need.  In this, America truely emerged as a leader both economically and politically.  Due to Eurpean devestation from the war, America filled the void left by a weakened Endland who could no longer bear the world's leadership role as their once had.  Under this prosperous time, Americans sought out more satisfaction at home through new products and more free time, but also sought to extend their prosperity abroad which marked the start of Americas enormous political and economic influence which still exists today.

===message:I agree, Wendy. The amazing thing was that the U.S. economy grew so much when we were also committing billions to rebuild European economies. Not coincidentally, all of this helped America emerge as "the" Superpower. What played out was an international chess game that promised aid to Europe and virtually guaranteed vast returns as well. However, this newly-adopted American foreign policy coupled with the Soviet Union’s desire for communist dominance led to an era of military instability. Thus, while Americans sat in their new houses and watched their televisions while washing the laundry in their washing machines, they were also digging bomb shelters in preparation for a seemingly inevitable nuclear attack. Indeed, there is no such thing as having your cake and eating it too.
