===message:Hello Keri. Perhaps I can put it in better perspective for you. The Cold War was essentially the next phase in global history after World War II. In it, two groups of states, one led by the United States and one led by Soviet Russia, strove throughout a succession of crises to achieve their own security by all means short of war. Much of what was said was put in ideological terms. In some countries the Cold War appeared as civil war or near-war, and as a moral debate about values such as freedom, social justice and individualism. Some of it was fought in marginal theatres by propaganda and subversion or by guerilla movements sponsored by the two great states involved. Fortunately, they always stopped short of the point at which they would have to fight with nuclear weapons whose increasing power made the notion of a successful outcome more and more unrealistic. The Cold War was also an economic competition by example and by offers of aid to satellites and uncommitted nations. In retrospect, for all the simple brutalities of the language it created, the Cold War now looks somewhat like the complex struggles of religion in 16th and 17th century Europe, when ideology could provoke violence, passion, and even at times, conviction. Or more so like the struggle of extreme Nationalism displayed by the Islamic fundamentalists of today. Although I believe what we are witnessing today is an expression of rage shared by many Moslems worldwide at the onset of secular westernization. Islamic societies had successfully resisted the infection of communism. Yet, to many Moslems, the contagion of the West now seems even more threatening. Paradoxically, the western revolutionary notion of capitalist exploitation, perhaps carried over from the Cold War, helped to feed these feelings. The roots of Islamic fundamentalism are very deep. Unfortunately, they were refreshed from the 60’s onward by the growing difficulties of the two great states in imposing their will on the Middle East and Persian Gulf. Finally, the responsible leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union appeared to have accepted that they could not be sure of imposing their will on the other by threat of war. They were also aware that victory in any real sense would be impossible in a full-scale nuclear war. But we now live in a world that is changing and threatened still be destabilization. And most disturbing is the fact that rulers in all countries do not share the realization that nuclear war could mean the destruction of mankind.

===message:Your right, our governments lead its people to believe that the other country was the evil one. In my opinion I believe that the government was the only evil one in the picture. If we learned about each other government for ourselves, then that fear of the other country would not have existed.
