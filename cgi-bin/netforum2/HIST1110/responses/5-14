===message:I agree with you that Roosevelt was there at the right time, but he could not have saved the country by himself. I believed the people also help because they used the resources available to them and given to them by Roosevelt. Just because Roosevelt had the 16 new "services" pass does not mean that the people had to use them, through that would not have been smart of them, another point congress did not have to pass them. So I think that everyone worked together so it was successful. Don't get me wrong Roosevelt was a wonderful man and did many wonderful things for the American people, but from what I see it was a team effort.
