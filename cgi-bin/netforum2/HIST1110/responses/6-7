===message:I totally agree with you when you say that the actions of some of today's athletes reflect the change in society.  Also, I have to agree that it is difficult to compare the athletes of that era with the athletes of today.  Pardon the pun, it was an entirely different ball game back then.  It is my opinion that people still want to hold athletes in such high regard because of the great athletes of that era.  Athletes were the "heroes" of that time.
