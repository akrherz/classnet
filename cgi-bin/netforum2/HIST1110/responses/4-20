===message:In response to Heidi Sprinkles: I think you make an excellent point.  The United States does have the attitude that it has to be where the action is.  The U.S. sticks its nose in everyone’s business.  You also touched on the greed aspects of war.  Most wars do initially take place due to control and greed.
