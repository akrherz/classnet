===message:I think your feelings about how sports is being treated in this country is shared by most people.  Things are done totally different in this era, not only in sports but in all works of life.  Society is changed,people are changed and do things that were not thought of by those of the 1920's. However, I do not think it's best to boycott sports because it generates a lot of money which eventually gets back into the system, and help the economy.  I suggest that there should be some sort of regulation by the government for owning and running  a sporting establishment, so that these owners won't go out of their way to make their own rules.  For the players, the code of conduct should be strictly enforced, and any players violating this code should be dismissed from the team. We have many owners, and players who are people of integrity, and take their jobs very seriously, one example is Michael Jordan.  Someone like Mike Tyson should have been dismissed from sports a long time ago because of his disgraceful behaviors.

===message:Doug, I can totally see where you are coming from with your view on “athletes and their arrogant, greedy and selfish attitudes, and “bad-boy” antics”.  There are a lot of ‘corrupt’ athletes of all types, Tyson and the ear incident, the countless athletes that use steroids to exploit their strength, (which if you ask me the athlete is nothing but a fake at what he thinks he is good at), and most importantly, what all they get away with because of their fame.  OJ Simpson had guilty written in blood on his forehead but is he behind bars?  Wonder why not?  But then again, sports do economize a lot of our country and for some reason, gives individuals an internal emotion of excitement.  I could not fathom boycotting sports (maybe because I enjoy some types of sports myself).  I agree with Edith that there should be regulation in the system of sporting events.  But then again, it is just another issue that everyday culture and society has to deal with.  There is not much we can do about it when millions of Americans pour money into and keep alive the incredible cunning world of American diversion.  (And media, movies, and movie stars are just a few more examples of American diversion.)  We just have to face the fact, we gave birth and supported and fed this increasingly large propaganda of fame for a few.

===message:Thank you both for your comments. However, I still believe that we must boycott some sports to send a message to the greedy and arrogant players and owners. And I strongly disagree that it “generates a lot of money that eventually gets back into the system.” Yes, it generates a ton of money. Yet, does it really get back into the “system?” Granted, a very small percentage of the money spent will go to the associated venders, parking lot attendants, security, etc. But I would venture to guess that a very large percentage goes towards fulfilling the exorbitant salaries and profits of the players and owners. Does this help the economy? Very little! Take the baseball strike for example. After the players and owners recently contemplated another walkout, the fans should have boycotted in response to this (although many did and still have). We need to show both of them that we will not tolerate this type of behavior or the soaring prices that sustain it. Brad Humphreys, professor of economics at the University of Maryland, was quoted on cnnmoney.com that “There is no evidence of detectable effect on the local economies (of a baseball strike).” He said most fans will take the money they would have spent on the sport hit by a stoppage and spend it on other forms of entertainment, such as dinner out or movies, which pumps more money into the local economy. I’ll continue making my contributions to the local and national economy by purchasing durable goods and services. Yet, I will not allow my hard earned dollars to support greed and arrogance.

===message:Doug, I agree that sports has evolved into another flowering entertainment business and it does bother me greatly that these people are being idealized by our children.  Kids today think that the real goal in life is to be like a sports or movie star and “make it big” in the industry and win at all costs.  Unfortunately, these ideas are becoming entrenched into the hearts and minds of the public and the media is doing everything to promote it since there’s a large payoff in it for them.  My suggestion is to teach our children early not to idealize these kinds of people and put them on a pedestal.  By doing this we could stop them from turning into greedy, arrogant, win-at-all-costs adults.

===message:In the 1900s, Joe Louis and Babe Ruth was consideres the most famous and popular athletes during that time. These two athletes valued their profession as business and the American public admired them because they were the best at all odds that was againsted them. People from that era didn't have to worry about baseball strikes because it was all about the game and the recognition to be the best, not about the money that comes with the fame.
Today, we have many sports heroes like Hank Aaron, Michael Jordan, Barry Bonds, Tiger Woods, and Nolan Ryans. These men are good role models for our children to follow. These men have shown that with a positive attitude fame and fortune will follow in the successful business of sports. The American people appreciate the players when they are their best in their game.
American people dislike an athlete who have a foul and arrogant behavior. Mike Tyson is a prime example of a player who needs to be ban from all sports. He is a disgrace to his profession and the sport profession. If the Sports Commission doesn't put a handle on athletes behavior, we will have more Mike Tyson coming into the sports profession. Then the fans will boycott sports. Who needs another fool, when we have him.

===message:I totally agree with you. While sports is a great part of our everyday life, it has gotten out of hand. Yes I think we need to give credit to the athletes for their achievements. Its is a great gift just as any other talent. We have just let it get out of hand. Look at all the great athletes from other countries that participate in the Olympics. Do you think they make any money for this? Do you think any other country pays their athletes like the US? Athletes are whiny and expect everything handed to them on a silver platter. We have made them that way. It is our fault. We idolize them for the wrong reasons. We buy everything they endorse. We make them rich. They did not become this way by themselves. It starts in High School. Colleges start scouting for the best players. Then they get to college and do whatever it takes for them to make it. We all have heard about the big bribes ect.

===message:Wendy, I agree with you that for the most part, today's staring athletes are not the best role models for children to look up to. I've noticed that through being around middle schoolers, (my husband has done a lot of work in middle school student ministry and i occasionall substitute teach) most want to grow up and be rich and they don't want to have to put any hard work into it (unless its sports related of course, but even steroids can assist a young, rising athlete in cheating his way to the top). I may be naive, but it seems that  admirable athletes like Woods, and the Williams sisters have worked their way to fame honestly through hard work and determination. If when I have children, one of them decides that athletics is their thing, then I will encourage their goals, but also make sure they are in check with everything else like morals and academics.

===message:You support Greed and arrogance when you go onto cnnmoneyline.com, when you go to the movies, when you go out to eat...you might be supporting another person's greed and arrogance whether it is a sports player or movie star or just a simple owner of a fancy restaurant. So wouldn't you say no matter what you do in today's time, you are in someway supporting SOMEONE's greed and arrogance?  I agree, I believe we should have boycotted baseball back when they threatened to strike....what gave them the right?  WE support their jobs, family, kids, etc...but boycotting sports is boycotting a form of entertainment.  Wouldn't we need to boycott movies, television, the internet, certain brands of clothing (I.E. Tommy Hilfiger) just because they make more money and are ignorant about their ablilities?

===message:First of all Keri, you need to include economics in your pursuit of educational excellence. Second of all, greed is defined as “an excessive desire to acquire or possess more than one needs or deserves, especially with respect to material wealth.” Although a few movie stars may fall into this category, the editor at cnnmoney.com or the fancy restaurant owner do not. Yet, when a baseball player who is earning over a million dollars a year (this is diminutive by today’s standards) is still not satisfied, this is greed and arrogance! And the public needs to send a message to them that they are not going to support this type of conduct. We have this capability. Just as we have the capability to stop buying Microsoft products for example (my next computer will be an Apple) because of the poor products they offer (XP) and the shrewd and bullying business practices they display. I’ll admit, we all need some form of entertainment in our lives. Yet, we shouldn’t tolerate the senseless and outrageous squabbling between the players and owners of professional sports organizations. Nevertheless, if I were to boycott all of the individuals or organizations that earned more money than I do, I would be living in a cardboard box and wearing a loincloth.

===message:Doug, you are right on target.  I agree with you about the media's need to create entertainment.  It is very unfortunate that these athletes are getting this type of attention, but the athletes are putting their themselves in this position....they love the spotlight and being the center of attention whether it be negative or positive.  It's all about them.

===message:Doug, I do and don't agree with your statement. The media does play a very important role in the athletes career and behavior, but I don't think by boycotting the sport will solve the problem because of one particular player or owner.
I, myself, do not go to a game just to watch one person or who own a certain team. I go to the game because I like the team who is playing, just because you as one individual doesn't like that person who is playing or the owner, do what most American people do. Turn the station or don't go to the game yourself. But boycotting is not necessarily the solution.
