===message:I agree with you on Americans and Germans about Nationalism, but all of the countries in the Depression were about Nationalism.  However, I strongly disagree when you say we were like Nazi in a since of discrimination.  We did have separate facilities for the blacks, but we never threw them into a pit of fire and killed them because we thought they were nasty, immoral to our society.  When America was born, slavery was 'ok'.  Countries all around the world were using slavery, and not just African Americans, whites too, and at that point of time, it was considered 'ok'.  Then we had all of the protest about how it was wrong, yes it was, we as a country never stood down from that.  We changed laws and tried to integrate peacefully, but you still had the ignorant southerners who tried with all of their power to keep integration from happening.  The reason why black people were discriminated against was because when they came to America a long time ago, many Englishmen and colonist had never seen the black man and so it was fear that drove our ancestors to think as they did.  We do not know what it was like to live in a society where the govn’t tried to control every aspect of our lives.  Back then, if you did not belong to a particular religion, you might have been yelled at, called names, etc. etc.  Not once did we, as Americans, try to exterminate a race.  That is what it all boils down to.  Maybe we had some of the same ideas as the Germans, but Not the Nazi.  The Nazi was after one thing, extermination of a human race….do you really believe Americans were after the same goal?

===message:Thanks to both Yvelle and Keri for giving their points of view.  I must say that I agree with Yvelle.  The discussion question asked if there was ever a time in history when American ideals about what made Americans special were ever harmful to others in the United States.  The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes. Yvelle brought up very important instances in American history when African-Americans were the targets of inferiority in the US due to America's ideal of a White dominated country where non-whites were inferior.  Evidence of this ideal of white superiority was directed not only towards African-Americans but also towards Native Americans.  Native Americans were indeed subject to white America's need to be superior.  For instance, Native Americans were stripped and deprived of their own lands, murdered, and often deceived into becoming subordinates of white American domination. Keri, it seems as if you feel African-Americans were not treated as bad as Hitler treated Jewish people because you stated "We did have separate facilities for the blacks, but we never threw them into a pit of fire and killed them because we thought they were nasty, immoral to our society." It is documented in history that African-Americans were murdered and lynched for one reason and one reason only because they were black.  If being black is the only reason they were murdered, then this is definitely proof that African-Americans were seen by whites as an inferior, low-life race who deserved to be murdered because they were non-white.  This again is a parallel to Hitler's reasoning for murdering Jews, just because they were non-white.  If you need more proof of African-American injustices due to White superiority in America, I must direct you to a movie and book named "Roots" as well as the documentary "Eyes on the Prize:  The Civil Rights Struggle."  Overall, African-Americans and Native Americans did not fit into the mold of America's ideals.  If they did, then I have a question.  Why throughout history weren't African-Americans and Native Americans treated equally with White Americans?

===message:I have stated my opinion.  Never in the history of the United States did one of our political leaders try and exterminate...(read up on Hitler's views of why he did what he did) a race.  Hitler wanted one thing...to create a society of Blue eyes, Blond hair, the taller, the better.  We as Americans NEVER tried to create one superior race...we allowed so many immigrants into this country in the beginning, but Hitler would not even let a Jew survive.  This country is so multi-cultured, our foundation was built off of being different.  However, Hitler thought ANYONE who was not German was immoral.  Do you really believe we as Americans were anything like the Nazi...Because to me, no one in this country has ever been like Hitler, not even close.

===message:Hi Keri, appreciate your point of view to the issue.  As for the Americans having the same ideas as the Nazis, yes you are right to an extent.  African Americans were not killed in gas chambers, but thousands of them were burned and had their body parts cut off because of their skin completion.  And if that wasn’t enough, their body parts were saved as souvenirs and their bodies remained hung from the tree for days as if they were monuments.  If you would like further documentation on lynching, please read “Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America,” “At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America”, and there are many other books out there that will confirm my statements.

===message:In America, strong nationalism controls much of our thoughts toward others.  We have an attitude of superiority in industry, buisness, sports, and power.  We believe that our political ideals are better than an other.  Some of these beliefs are justifiable.  The competitve nature of humans causes people to seek superiority.  Our hunting/gathering ancestory followed the kill or be killed philosophy, which still pretty much governs our society today.  Strengthening the country makes people proud, and Hitler took advantage of pride and human emotion to develop his following.  Similarly, our government and media play on the strong nationalism and pride in Americans (how many songs can you think of about American Pride?)  Some of the ideals about superiority intertwine with Nazi ideals.  The original goal of the Nazi's was to make Germany a powerful nation.  However, the practices differ staunchly.  Americans as a whole have never come close to this blantant disregard for humanity and culture.  The extermination of a race of people has never been remotely characteristic of American society and goverment, whereas the feeling of superiority has.
