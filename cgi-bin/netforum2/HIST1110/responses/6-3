===message:I definitely agree with the idea that qualities of peace, love, loyalty and honesty are lacking in many athletes today.  This is simply a representation of our society because we no longer value these kinds of qualities in ourselves.  Many of us, like the athletes, are striving to be the more powerful, popular, and rich too.  Yes, we all would like to see more trustworthy, peaceful athletes, but if we want to see a change then we have to start working on our own ethical issues.

===message:Wendy your discussion helped me see another reason why americans may have looked up to an athlete like Babe Ruth.  He was a normal guy with a normal body who performed great things on the baseball field.  Actually, he had a very unsportsman like physique when I think about it.  He had true natural talent.  In way people could look at him and say "If he could do that maybe I could too"!  The millionaire athletes of today are in a very small percentage of the population.  You have have to work very hard and those bodies are not born they are made.  Small children and young adults look up to todays athletes because they could actually say "When I grow up I wanna be like Mike" (Michael Jordan).  Adults really cant say the same unless they start to work at this from a young age.

===message:I agree with your comment about Babe Ruth being a "man of the people," he seemed like a normal guy with extraordinary abilities.  People probably admired the fact that he was an average guy that came from an orphan and then started making more money than the president.  I think even back then, people looked up to the fact that he came from very little and made a great name for himself, as well as very good money.  However, on your comment about the sports figures posed, I think these athletes can be admired for their talent and dedication to becoming the best in their craft.  I can respect a hard worker, however, I do think you are right about their "traits" not being admirable.
