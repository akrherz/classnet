===message: I agree with your account.  Both Americans and Russians used propaganda in the media, literatures, drama, and films to depict each other as bad or evil.   Their citizens were brainwashed and they believed in their government.  There was a power struggle between the two countries whereby Russia wanted to advance communism throughout the world, while the United States "preached" democracy.  Apart from helping Europe rebuild, it was believed that one of the reasons for the “Marshall Plan” was to win countries over to democracy.   Also the Cuban missile crises  which nearly led to a nuclear war was one of the examples of the power struggle between these two superpowers.

===message:I agree with what both of you said. To see two countries act like friends, hugging and laughing together on the "Meeting on the Elbe" then a few years later begin to hate eachother. This was mostly for the love of their country. The Soviet people loved Stalin so much that his idea to spread communism was like a great idea to them. When he talked about capitalism destroying the US and the people of the US, that is all the people believed and because he said it, then it was so. The US people did not him to spread communism all over because of what you said... the fear. It's funny the way they used propaganda to "brainwash" the people, we use it kind of in the same way today when companies advertise their products.

===message:The main objective of the Soviets and Americans was to spread their ideas, while the other tried to control the ideas being spread.  It's hard to believe we were all on the same side fighting just a couple of years before the cold war actually began,
