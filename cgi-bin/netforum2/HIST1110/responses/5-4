===message:I am confused as to what is meant by "The New Deal created a class of people who looked towards the government for hand-outs."  First, if this statement refers to the people who suffered and were poor as a result of the Depression then this is inaccurate.  When people have no food for their children, no place for them to live, and no means of providing these necessities, then it is never UNjustified for these individuals to seek resources from the government. One should always remember that no one should ever assume that he/she will not be in a similar situation because if they do find themselves in such a predicament then where would they turn if they are starving and have no means of restoration?

===message:I am sorry that it confused you.  What I mean is that before the "New Deal"  people in need had no where else to turn.  Roosevelt's New Deal changed all of that.  After the New Deal people had places to go for help...  The Federal Government. It "handed out" thousands of government jobs for people that were unemployed which made the federal government the largest employer in the United States.  My response was not intended to offend anyone at all so I am very sorry that you misunderstood me.  I hope that we can just stick to the facts and not assume that anyone is trying to offend other people in our class.  Not only am I getting my facts from the text but am also getting some feed back from people that actually lived in poverty during the Depression.  Again, I am sorry you misunderstood me and hope that I did not offend you or anyone else.

Janna, I am afraid that would NOT apologize for but am in agreement with the initial statements of  Debbie on this issue (whatever their meaning) . The New Deal, in the context of the depression, proved to be a positive step towards economic recovery. However, the economic interest in America swung quickly from a state affair to a federal one. This undermined the intent of the writers of the constitution who designed things of this nature to be handled on a state level. This is where the blame is to be placed for the ever-increasing tax rates that we loathe today.  Many economic historians would tell you that before the New Deal, government money flowed from Washington to the states. After Roosevelt’s plan went into effect, money flowed overwhelmingly from the states to the federal government. The Social Securities Act of 1935 bolstered the federal bureaucracy further and it became so ingrained by the 1950’s that it could not be removed. This also presents itself as a hefty deduction from the paychecks today’s workforce. Furthermore, the New Deal, as Ms. Whiteman explained, created a class of people who look to the federal government for handouts. Critics of the New Deal dubbed it "milking the government". There will always be some impoverished people that will need TEMPORARY assistance from government agencies, and that should be condoned. However, the federal government was not created to carry the impoverished on it’s back. When people are placed on long term aid and depend solely on the government for  their well-being, the weight is not carried by the government - it becomes the responsibility of other citizens who work. The government extracts money to pay welfare and social security out to those who are "less fortunate". Capitalism, under which, the country has been prosperous thus far, relies on the reality that there will always be those that are "prosperous" and those who are not. Frankly, those who have been so sentimentally labeled "less fortunate" are simply economic underachievers. And, it is not the working citizen’s responsibility to compensate for someone else’s shortcomings. You are correct that one never knows when he or she will be in a situation where they could use assistance. However, that is the nature of the world and, ultimately, it is no one’s responsibility other than that individual’s. I submit to you that it is ALMOST ALWAYS unjustified for society’s underachievers to look elsewhere for a handout. If they find their situation unacceptable, there are more opportunities in this nation than any other for them to change it.

===message:Debbie, I agree that the main reason the economy recovered was because World War II created a need for war materials and this in turn created a need for a great number of employees.  This is probably why so many people found jobs after the war started.  Naturally, people with jobs had more money to spend and this lifted the economy out of the doldrums.  However, it’s sad to think that the only way people in the United States were helped was by a war.

===message:First, I'd like to state that it is most certainly acceptable for us to have a difference of opinion on an issue such as this.  However, it is inappropriate and disrepectful to create a response where you are in effect "shouting" at a fellow classmate's response by using capital letters (as Dr. Rosenburg state's in the class syllabus).  It is so unfortunate that there are still individuals who would continue to stereotype others and place them into a category of "underachievers" based on their economic status. Our society bases one's prominence and worth in life on how much money they have or can obtain.  Focusing on welfare and long-term government assistance is simply going elswhere with the issue of the New Deal and its effectiveness on creating jobs and programs after the Depression.  Instead of simply creating stereotypes for human beings based on their economic status, one should effectively research as to the source of such problems before concluding that their requests are unjustified.

===message:I do not think there is one person in this discussion who doesnt think there is need for Welfare Reform.  The ideas created by the New Deal are helpful in the aid of citizens who cannot find work.  The intention of the program is temporary.  Hopefully everyone in this class is aware enough to realize the lack of enforcement of today's social programs.  The role of the government is to "promote the general welfare."  I truly believe that interpretation encourages the goverment to create oppurtunity for unlucky citizens.  This clause from the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution, however, does not read "PROVIDE the general welfare."  There are too many free riders under this system.  The ideas are pure, but the enforment is horribly lacking.

===message:Bravo!!!! In one sentence you managed to express what I was feeling as a read our classmates discussions on Ms. Whitemans response.  The discussion cascaded from opinions about the New Deal to people on welfare.  Even thought Ms. Whiteman, did not understand how someone could confuse her comment about someone getting a job from the government as a "handout", their was no need for her to apologize.  That is her opinion and she is allowed to express it as long as it is in the context of the class syllabus.  I think (this is my opinion) that our classmates forgot the initial question that Dr. Rosenburg posted.  I would also like to thank you for the reply you posted to one of our other classmates about one of my postings.

===message:I have been reading all of the postings trying to figure out to whom I should reply.  I watched one person post their opinion, and from there it escalated to a topic on which was not even posted as a general discussion topic.  People should learn to respect other's opinions and try not to OFFEND anyone.  We are all adults and we all read the syllabus.  I hope that grades are not affected because of one's bad etiquette. If you feel like you would like to get off the topic, might I suggest that you pay a visit to the chat room.  That way everyone can get their discussion points for not veering off the subject matter.  Thank you kindly.

===message:The New Deal helped people to start looking up to the government for hand-outs. It simply crated the jobs and other acts to get the economy going again. World War II did not have that much to do with the recovery of this country. The economy was up and running again before Americans entered the war. If the New Deal was not put into place, many of these factories that employed many people to help with the war effort would not have even existed when America entered the war.

===message:I totally agree with the free hand out part.  At the time it was a great idea.  But it definately should not of lasted until now.  At the time there wasn't the jobs or places to get jobs like it is now.  The free hand out should of only lasted for the time period in which it was needed, not now for sure.
