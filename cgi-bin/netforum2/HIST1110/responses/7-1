===message:Edith, I agree with your statement. America is the land of freedom and we must not base people on their race, religion, or sexual orientation. God created use all in his own image but in our world today, prejudice still do exist. This world is different, no one suppose to be the same. Everyone has his or her views and opinion of themselves, there is no such thing as a "Master Race." No one is made to be perfect, we all have hidden flaws that have not been viewed outside one self. We as people shouldn't hate people for who they are or what the color of their skin maybe. 
To me, Hilter was not a true Aryan origin, yes, he was white but where was his blonde hair and blue eyes. He made people of other races inferior because they didn't meet his specification. Jews, Gypsy, blacks, and homosexual was considered an outcast because of who they were. We as people are still judging people of color and sexual preference and not for a person characteristic. Man does not have the power to create a "Master Race" without certain consequences. If God wanted a perfect "Master Race", he would have created one himself. We are all different that's the way it is, so we all have to deal with it.

===message:Thanks for your response.  You know, Race is a word that is explosive, and if we continue talking about it, we may offend someone. When the Biologist Charles Darwin talked about the survival of the fittest, he really knew what he was talking about.  The human race has come a long way, and it is only by the grace of God that some colors in this race survived.
