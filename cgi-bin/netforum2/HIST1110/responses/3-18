===message:I am not disagreeing with your opinion; however I would like to add to some of your thoughts.  WWI might have clarified some issues of government, but the settlement of the lands you mentioned did nothing but further harm.  A reason Hitler retaliated was the land and consequences that the Treaty of Versailles stated.  It left Germany weakened and humiliated as well as deprived of great-power status (something extremely important to European Countries back then).  The German’s resentment burst forth upon the world with an even greater violence, WWII and Nazism.  Post WWI did leave a time for breaking with tradition and experimenting with new styles of politics and culture, but I believe it did more harm and damage than ever before.  America had to step into this war for a number of reasons.  Germans began to bomb our ships that held American Civilians, people who had nothing to do with the war.  They (America) had to stand up for the right of our country and safety of others.  And let’s not forget the Zimmerman telegram, a message sent to the Mexican govn’t by a German Foreign Minister.  He promised Mexico New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona after the German victory if they stepped in on the German side.  A little after the Zimmerman telegram, Germany sank 4 American ships.  April 2, 1917, President Wilson then asked Congress for a declaration of war, which was well needed for America’s safety.  I also do not believe the govn’t viewed the war as positive because of one major implication that can be seen with the human eye.  Have you ever taken a look at a president before war then looked at a picture of him after war.  Aging, stress, and many other emotions that he has to deal with effects him physically and we all are there to see.  Think about you being the President for a day.  You have to keep your country safe but at the same time, you have to kill patriotic men in the process.  Is that a positive thought?
