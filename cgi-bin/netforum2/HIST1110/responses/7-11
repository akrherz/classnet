===message:Mr. Klausner, If one of your loved ones was killed in the disaster, don't you think you would want to take out Hussein?  I can agree that there have been many injustices directed toward other races in the United States, but prejudice will always be around (this doesn't make it right), but there will always be some "Archie Bunkers" to dislike anybody that thinks or looks different from them.

===message:I know 9/11 personally.  My parents are from NYC and I visited the WTC just before the atrocity.  My father's college roommate was killed there.  My uncle happened to have been delayed in Richmond and missed a meeting at WTC or he probably would have been a statistic.  My father works for the Army and the part of the Pentagon that was hit is where he has been visiting for years.  I was born not far from the plane crash in Pennsylvania.  Yes I want to kick butt, especially Bin Laden.  

However, show me the link to Hussein.  Bush intitially used the excuse that he harbored Bin Laden's crowd of thugs, but when challenged to prove it, the presdient backed down.  Retired Four Star generals including Schwartzkoff think invading Iraq is a mistake.  Contrary to the right wing, there is no Sudetenland.  Is Hussein an SOB threatening the region? Yes.  Is he a threat to the USA - sorry, but I don't see it at this time.  In fact I think Iran and North Korea is more of a threat as Hussein udnerstands survival.
