===message:I think your discussion sumed up the New Deal perfectly.  It was a program that helped people help themselves.  I have read other postings from our classmates that make the program seem like a handout from the government.  If it was a handout it was one that gave many americans hope and faith in their government.

===message:It is very true. President Roosevelt saved the nation. His deeds, thoughts, vision, and foresight started what eventually got the nation out of depression. I know the majority of people in this country loved him because of his New Deal program, but, we shouldn't totally disregard the few people who thought that resources were not distributed equally, that big gaps persisted between the rich and the poor, and the minorities who thought they did not get a fair share of things.

===message:I agree that Hoover did nothing to relieve the depression, however it is unfair for us to look back following 70 years of federal involvement and condemn him for basically doing what most presidents did: nothing local.  Roosevelt fostered a revolution.  To understand Hoover one must look at the presidency before Roosevelt which for the most part meant non-involvement.

===message:Well ok, but does that mean that just because everyother president did nothing that he just sit back and do nothing too? No... he should have stepped up especially went the country was in need.
