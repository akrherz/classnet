===message:Debbie Whiteman I believe prejustice is still a very huge issue in America.  I am not sure where you have been lately, but the issue gets bigger and bigger each year.  There is constant termoil between races in America.

===message:I agree with you Debbie that Americans during the reign of Hitler were extremely racist and prejudice.  Many non-white people were tortured and humiliated, some were even killed.  Although racism and prejudice still exist today, I agree that it is far less than it was 50 years ago.  Mark stated that racism is increasing every year, but look at the major differences between 1950 and 2000.  There has been a tremendous amount of relief from racism.  I am not by any means discounting that prejudice and racism do not exist because they do, however, it is much better for non-white races to live in America today rather than 50 years ago.
