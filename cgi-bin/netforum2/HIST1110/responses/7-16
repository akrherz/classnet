===message:I totally agree with your discussion, you made some excellent points about the awful acts that were committed against americans of non-white backgrounds.  The more of these discussions I read the more I see the similarities between Nazi views and the views of certain americans.

===message:Melone, I think that you made some terrific points. When I watched the Master Race video I thought the same thing. How can Americans raise their noses at Hitler and Germany when like you said they were doing the same thing. I think it's terrible! After reading many of the responses I am very glad that a lot think this way... the same way I do because it shows me how much progress(even though there is still racial discrimination out there) America has made.

===message:Melone's post was brilliant.  I couldn't have said it better myself. I'm glad that someone sees the hypocrisy in the situation.  The supreme right justification is a link between the two ideas.  They both call on the divine as another justification for their ideas.  But who questions whether the most divine(God) would approve of such thoughts and actions?
