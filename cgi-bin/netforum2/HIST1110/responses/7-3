===message:The KKK is not the same as the Nazi's attempted genocide in the 1930's and 1940's.  Although just as terrible, the Klan represents a radical group that is not mainstream.  Political leaders do not perpetuate the KKK's sickening ideals, but rather only small fairly insignificant group of society.  This is not to clense the KKK of guilt, but mearely to point out that the Nazi aggression toward the Jews became a national effort.

===message:Keith, yes you are right that the KKK is not supported by our government (thankfully!!).  However, you must remember that if a majority of the German people did not want Hitler to come to power, then he wouldn’t have been made Chancellor.  Many individuals in Germany supported Hitler’s ideas about racial superiority.  Also, don’t forget that during World War II our government in the United States rounded up and deported thousands of Japanese Americans after the attach on Pearl Harbor and these people were citizens of the United States that had nothing to do with the Pearl Harbor attack (why then do you think our government mistreated them?).  So even in America, maltreatment of ethnic minorities is still prevalent and we must always be on guard against it lest it become mainstream.

===message:Wendy, yes we did deport Japanese after the Pearl Harbor attack, but because we thought they had some sorta of spy network based out of the United States.  I agree with you, that was a little absurd, but where I disagree is when you said when Hitler came to power, Germany supported his racial superiority.  That is a little wrong.  When Hitler came to power, NO ONE hated Jewish people as much as Hitler hated them.  There is still a lot of controversy over when his hatred really began, but it really started after WWI.  He used propaganda to encrypt into Germans minds that the Jewish population was the ones for all of the troubles of Germany.  He would go over the radio day after day, sometimes twice a day and protest to Germany over airwaves that Jews were the place to blame all of their faults.  And since blaming is easy, he made Germans believe what he said was true.  Hitler, I believe, was the most powerful person that has ever walked the face of this earth (since Jesus).  I do NOT agree with what he did, in my own opinion, he was a scumbag.  But I can not deny that fact he was powerful.  He had a country rally behind him and HIS idea that the Jewish population was immoral and had to be exterminated.  He made an ENTIRE country believe his view of the world.  We have never had a government official stand and make us Americans believe that white people were a superior race.  We have never had a government poison our minds day after day and make us believe that another race, different from ours, had to be exterminated.  And I really believe, (because I am German) if anyone would have known what Hitler’s intentions were, he would have never came to power in the first place.  (Remember, Nazi and Germans are different people.)

===message:
Keri, according to our book, there was a lot of hatred against the Jews before Hitler came to power.  For instance, while he was in Vienna there were many anti-Semitic people who persuaded him that the Jews were the Germans’ worst enemies (see page 130).  Also, when I took Music Appreciation, we learned that the great Romantic composer, Richard Wagner, who lived from 1813 – 1883 was very anti-Semitic along with others during that time.  You are right that Hitler used propaganda to incite hatred in the hearts of the Germans.  Yet each individual that went along with his propaganda still made the conscience decision to believe him.  Peer pressure is an amazing thing.  It can make or break you.  Swimming against the tide is not easy and is in fact ten times as hard as going with the flow of popular believe.  There’s no denying Hitler was an extremely evil person.  The reality is that there are bad people in every country.  The trick is stubbornly sticking to what you believe is right and not letting the “Hitlers” of the world wear down your principles, come what may, whether you're white, black, German, American or whatever.

===message:Keri, I agree with your statement. No one knew what type of man Adolf Hitler would become when the people of Germany elected him as chancellor in January 1933. Unbeknown to the people, Hitler had many dangerous ideas. Hitler claimed the German people belonged to a superior "Aryan" race that was destined to control inferior races and rule the world. He believed only Germans with blond hair and blue eyes were "true Germans." To him, these Germans were better than everyone, Germans and non-Germans alike. Hitler was a racist, demented, and evil man. During World War II, many people knew that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis had been putting people in concentration camps, killed and used for cruel medical experiments, but did nothing. Hitler was powerful because he had his Nazi German army doing his evil deeds and plus some of them were afraid of doing anything against his wishing, fearing of being killed themselves. But that is still does not give any excuse to kill so many innocent women, men, and children because of their ethnic background.
