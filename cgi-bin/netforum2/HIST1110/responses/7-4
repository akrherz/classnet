===message:Hi Doug, I appreciate your response to the questions.  You are right when you said, "...American idea of patriotism and freedom has never been harmful to another race."  The harm came into play becasue the ideas were not made to make every American feel special in the mid twentieth century.  Some people were exclude just like the Jews and homosexuals were excluded from the Nazis ideas too.  Those who were considered as the superior race were the only ones who benefited from the ideas.

===message:Thanks Doug for your previous statements.  I agree that the American idea of patriotism and freedom in itself was not harmful to others in the US.  However, this notion was unequally apportioned to all Americans.  The unequal allocation of this idea was what caused it to be harmful to others.  The idea of freedom alone did not bring about this harm.

===message:Doug, I have to disagree with you on this one.  Your comment about the "American" idea of patriotism and freedom ever being harmful to another race is what troubles me.  Lest we not forget that the Americans were the ones who enslaved the black people.  They thought it was a great idea to take people from their country and make them work as slaves.  They thought it was a great idea to claim this land, call it America, and also kill a great number of Native Indians.  So, I ask you the question...as far as the idea of patriotism and freedom ever being harmful to another race, of whom are we speaking? Also, on your comment about Muslims, the people held responsible for the terrorists attacks on America were the "exception to the rule" of Muslim people.  The Muslim religion is one of peace, and the people who carried out those horrible attacks, did not abide by the same principles of most Muslims.  I am not apprehensive when it comes to Muslim people for the "rotten apples that spoiled the bunch," just like I'm not disturbed by the Americans that enslaved and killed my ancestors. If I was, I would consider myself to be holding some of the racist values that we as an American people have grown to detest.
