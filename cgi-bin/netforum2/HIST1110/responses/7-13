===message:Good job Robert! I’d say that pretty much puts a closure on this issue.

===message:Doug, Do you really believe that Robert's statistics puts "a closure to the issue?"  First, I will state that Robert's statistics does not include those who died and were murdered during the voyage from Africa to America, nor does it include the deaths of Native Americans which I included in my initial response.

===message:These statistics were NOT intended to justify the unequal treatment of African-Americans or Native-Americans. Certainly there are some things that are somewhat shameful in America's past. These statistics were to illustrate that there can be no comparison between the United States and Nazi Germany. I collected them because I find some of the comments on this issue very hard to stomach - some of which I hold my response from in the interest of clean language. It is a sad state of affairs when irresponsible, over-exaggerated statements are made about America's history and in the interest of political correctness, they go uncontested. Unfortunately, through repetition, these untruths tend to become accepted as fact in today’s society. It cheapens the deeds of all those who have molded this country into the greatest, most opportunistic nation in a world filled with inequities. I challenge all of you to examine the statements made that equate Americans to Nazis - even the replies that will follow this very posting - and ask yourselves if  they are fact, or merely far-fetched similarities intended to perpetuate the idea that we all should somehow be ashamed or need to offer apologies for things that occurred a hundred years ago. I don’t believe that anyone is inherently superior to another because a difference in their skin color but I do feel a need to ask for historical accuracy and a fair interpretation of the accounts of  American society.

===message:Sorry Doug, Robert’s statistics does not put an end to anything.  First of all, I and other students who mentioned lynching were NOT comparing the number of African Americans deaths to the number of Jew deaths.  What I was trying to state was that cruelty was done to a particular race because of their skin completion or nationality.  Robert, if you read the whole documentation written by the NAACP about lynching, then you would have also noticed that the numbers were based on lynching that were reported.  Do not try to act as if lynching is just some folktale because it’s not.

===message:I agree with you a 100%. Even though most of the lynchings were not in the hands of the government. The Government let the group and individuals who did the lynchings get away with the crime. So in a sense the government did help to contribute the extermination of African-Americans.

===message:Yes, as far as I’m concerned this issue is closed. I believe both Mr. Jones and I have provided exceptional facts and statistics in our postings to dispel any erroneous similarities between Nazis and Americans. We all agree that the varying degrees of atrocity committed against Jews, African-Americans, and Native Americans (and whomever else) in both Germany and the United States were appalling and there is clearly no logical justification for them (or one that would be accepted by traditional society at least). Lastly, because neither my family nor I were associated with any of these deplorable crimes against humanity, I do not feel inclined to continue perpetuating this issue.              Have a nice day and good luck on the exam.
