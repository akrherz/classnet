===message:I agree with much of what you said.  However, I don't believe that the US, especially the government, always told the truth.  For instance, the Viet Nam War was justified by an incident in the Gulf of Tonkin that appears to have never happened.  The success of the military leadership in that war was evaluated by the number of enemy dead.  Counts were faked.  That is why the military no longer uses that as an indicator of success.  There have been other lies such as the denial over the Iran-Contra. 

I believe the key difference between America and the Soviets is the free media.  The Soviet government controlled the media while in the US, the media was and is independent, though often manipulated by the government.

===message:When one thinks about the issue, what is the real "truth" as far as the conflict between the US and Soviet Union.  To the people of both countries whatever information the media told them was considered the "truth" about the whole dilemma.

===message:The post World War II era was a fragile time in the world for government, economics and nationalism.  The emergence of two superpowers of opposite governments could not have been better scripted for a movie.  The USSR and the United States efficiently used propaganda and twisting of the facts to influence the public that their way was the right way.  Both governments saw the fall of facism as the opportunity for their goverment to rise victorious.  The Soviet Union demonized the Allies and their democratic and capitalistic methods through intense propaganda and control of news.  One prime example was the Soviet propaganda film, THE MEETING ON THE ELBE.  In the film, the actors paint a picture of the defeat of the Germans in that Battle on the Elbe River.  The victory celebration portrays the Allied Powers taking the credit for a Soviet victory.  The filmmakers show the Allies little short of greedy babarians.  This film backed the leaders assurance that communism is the answer and that capitalism exploits the common man and is evil.
    The United States participated as heavily as the Soviets in the propaganda department.  Several prominant celebrity figures participated in television ads promoting America's fight for Communist containment.  Ronald Reagan participated in one such film in which he expressed the faults of the Communist system.  RADIO LIBERTY was another attempt by the United Sates to persuade the public.  This weekly radio program, however, was brodcast to Russia and other communism blocs.  This program explained the prosperity in America and dispelled many lies that the Soviet government had convinced its people.
    Both sides lived in fear of the other government.  Both Soviet and American leaders convinced their citizens that they were the envy of the world.  Both sides also participated in scare tactics to halt compassion with in the other.  The United States used the McCarthy trials as a means to spread the word that Communism was evil, while the Soviets participated in purges against those who rose against the government.  The Soviets also publicized mock trials, in which American Spies were portrayed as evil criminals.  This fear was instilled into the public by both sides.  Each campaign was tremendously successful because of the censorship of news and the lack of first hand knowledge of each others culture.

===message:Yes I agree with what you said.  We were proven right in the long run.  The Soviets thought they were right at the time.  That's part of life is trial and error.  That is what makes humans so strong.  By the Soviets doing what they did, I believe it will have a lasting impression on the world to come.
