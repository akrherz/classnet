===message:Tonya, I must say that I totally agree with you.  Your points about athletes not being able to cope with what the athletes back then had to do is very true.  I also think that there are so many more athletes in today's society that even though they are admired, they are not revered nearly as high as those athletes over 50 years ago.  Not only did "old-time" athletes have to contend with their new-found fame, they also had the world issues to deal with.

===message:I strongly disagree with Tonya saying that Mike Tyson would crumble trying to excel at his sport in the backdrop of wars and struggle.  Conversely could Joe Louis perform the same way if he was viewed as and animal, a rapist, or less than a person?  I think not.

===message:I disagree with Tonya.  How can you call Micheal Jordan and Magic Johnson admirable?  Both are corupt, gambling, womanizers.  And how could you predict how Joe Lewis could react todays media and criticizm.
