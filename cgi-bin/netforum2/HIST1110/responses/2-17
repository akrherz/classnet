===message:All I need to say, you hit the nail on the head!  Good points...we do have a better life, but spend less and less time with our families.  Maybe that might be the reason why the kids are acting up in our schools, like some other people in the class noted.  We do have more medicines, but what about HIV/AIDS?  A virus that is killing off more and more people day to day!  And I would not let my kids cross the streets without knowing my neighbors EXTREMELY well, because looks are definitely deceiving now a-days.  You said everything I was trying to put in words but could not place together at the time!  You go girl~!
