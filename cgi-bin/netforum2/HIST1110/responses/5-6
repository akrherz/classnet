===message:I somewhat agree and disagree with your statement. Roosevelt's New Deal did relieve some of the pressure that Americans was feeling do to the depression. His New Deal did supply jobs for the people but the effects of the depression didn't end until the second world war came into existence.

===message:FDR may have saved capitalism in the U.S. It is doubtful that any other form of goverment would have taken hold, but the "New Deal" kept the alternate forms from gaining momentum in the U.S. Fascism, communism, and socialism were all gaining strength in areas of the world where democracies were failing in many countries. People were starting to feel that capitalism was not the greatest form of government and that it was time for change. This feeling was prevalent in the U.S. during the 1930's, but the "New Deal" helped bring capitalism back to its proper position as the greatest form of government.
