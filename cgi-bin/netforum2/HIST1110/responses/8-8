===message:Good point Wendy. The bloodiest reign of terror in modern history, which surpassed Hitler's attempted genocide of the Jews, was the leadership of Josef Stalin. During the 1930’s and 40’s, millions of people were killed in Stalin's purges. Many of these people were Christians. The Stalin era was a traumatic experience in both it’s immediate and long term implications. Then World War II abruptly changed the situation. Exploiting the Russian nationalism of the Orthodox Church, concessions were made between Stalin and Christian leaders. A relaxation of oppression led to a spiritual revival in the Soviet Union during the war. This relative freedom did not last long, however, as Nikita Khrushchev came to power in the 1950’s. Khrushchev unleashed a vicious attack against the Church, which lasted until his fall from power in 1964. Despite the Marxist directive to sweep aside the principles of Christianity, the strength of the Church continued to grow behind the Iron Curtain. The principles of communism, which were cultivated in the Soviet Union for nearly a century, never achieved the utopia, which Marx foresaw. Instead, the predictions of Russia's prophets are now beginning to come to pass.

===message:I agree with you about the brainwashing, it was done on both sides.  The Soviets and the Americans used propaganda in many ways to have their citizens think poorly against the other country, the soviets mainly in films.  I agree also that it was because of fear.  It was the communist east against the capitalist west.  Both countries feared that one would become more powerful than the other.  The U.S. wanted to link all other economies to their own to become an international giant and wanted the soviets to join.  When the soviets wanted no part of the U.S. economy one key way for the U.S. to threaten the soviets was to taunt them with nuclear power, however, the soviets were able to even up the nuclear race by exploding their own hydrogen bomb months later.

===message:I too believe that the hatred was out of fear of becoming "down-sized." Also I think another fear especially on the part of the people, was the lack of knowledge about the other countries beliefs. For instance, the American people really did not know anything about communist only what was told to them by the government. The same thing goes for the Soviets, they really did not know anything about the Americans and the capitalist system so whatever Stalin said was what they believed.

===message:I would like to touch on Wendy's post by saying that I cannot say that I believe that each side was motivated "primarily" by fear.  It could be better described as distrust of the other's motives.  This distrust then started a series of defensive tactics to head off agression from the other side which was perceived as a threat by the opposition.  This notion of a threat posed by each side set off the propaganda war which multiplied the conflict.

===message:Mark, I agree with what you said.  It was more so about distrust because at on point in time, they were able to work together to defeat Germany.  Of course when you distrust someone, you become very cautious about everything that person said or done which is exactly what both countries did.  It falls back to these countries trying to be the best country that will influence the rest of the world.  I believe that Stalin was also into imperialism.  He was trying to spread communism throughout the European countries.

===message:I agree that Stalin's actions are often overlooked, because Hitler is often thought of first when talking about ruthless leaders. The deaths at the hands of Stalin were greater than that of Hitler, however, Hitler is usually first in the minds of most people.
