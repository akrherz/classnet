===message:I really do not believe the New Deal was intended to 'end the depression totally', rather than as much as it was to help the starved.  The New Deal was to put Americans back to work to be able to support their family on the basic needs of life, i.e. food, clothing, and medical.  It did however save the people, saved the people from death, so in a way, it did save the country, the Americans that made up our country.

===message:The New Deal may not have eradicated the Depression all on its own, but it definitely marked the beginning of the end of the Depression.  I agree that the New Deal was not distributed equally because it did not make any changes with unorganized labor of which most African-Americans were employed under.

===message:There seems to one point that no one is touching on and that is that with all this new programs the size and scope of the government was greatly increased.  In some ways this was good because it created a lot of new jobs.  But with the creation of these programs and jobs someone has to help support them, this means taxes.  Also we are having to support the people how are currently receiving social security.  By the time I retired I believe that there will be not social security and the money that I am putting into it right now will never benefit me.  I would much rather plan for my own retirement and have the benefit of the money that I am having to put into the social security programs that I will never receive any benefit from.

===message:Janna, I must once again disagree with you on this issue. The New Deal was very advantageous to blacks. Blacks had more access to the federal government than ever before. The New Deal was intended to aid all, regardless of race. It could be argued that this was the beginning of a new ideal in black culture that led to the civil rights movement. If the black population was so overlooked by the New Deal, how do you explain the shift of the black vote to democratic under Roosevelt when it had been primarily Republican up to that point?

===message:Janna, I disagree with your statement. The depression didn't discriminate against any race. It affected all ethnic people as well as the rich and the poor. When Roosevelt's New Deal was organized everyone benefited. New programs was developed to end the unemployment status. The New Deal helped us all, but it was the Second World War that we all bebefited the most as far as economic income.

===message:Robert, I will reflect again on your opposition of my opinions. First, it is definitely true, that the New Deal was intended to create jobs and improve organized labor as a whole.  As stated, the New Deal was intended to aid all, regardless of race.  However, most African-Americans (the more appropriate term) were still in the same predicament after the New Deal as they were before concering improvement of labor conditions.  For instance, as Wendy stated unorganized labor was not helped as a result of the New Deal.  During that time, most African Americans/minorities were employed under this type of labor such as (cooks, maids, drivers, etc).  If African Americans were helped so much with labor issues and equality by the New Deal, then I have a question. Why was the Civil Rights Movement necessary?

===message:I agree with you on your statement about Roosevelt's New Deal being a saving measure.  In the video "Breadline," the farmers stated how Roosevelt helped them by buying their cows from them, canning the meat, and giving it back to them.  So, in the world of agriculture, I'm sure he was a saving grace.  I feel like he started giving the people hope that there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  Because of Roosevelt, people started having more respect for their government leaders, as well as a little faith.  Restoring confidence in government leaders helped economic recovery in the way that once the people began to trust their leaders again, citizens started to play more active roles in trying to free themselves from the depression.  Jobs were created, regulations were established so that hopefully in the future, this wouldn't happen again.  I also don't agree with the statement Mancil Milligan made about Roosevelt saving the country.  I think he started putting people on the right track to help and fend for themselves, and at the time, he was just what the country needed.

===message:You made some very good points, but I disagree with your statement that the New Deal was intended to help the big farmers the most.  I guess Mr. Rosenburg poses these questions because he knows that one person will view things differently than another.  I believe that the New Deal tried to help the unemployed workers the most.  Sure big farmers, as well as, small farmers benefited but what about the WPA (Work Progress Act)?  The WPA created jobs for many individuals, and it also helped to give other countries a head start out of depression.  I do agree that the depression was not over until WWII, but I believe many people benefited from the New Deal and not just big farmers.

===message:Roosevelt had some good ideas, but I believe he went overboard.  The economy was going to turn eventually.  Just like now the economy is poor but it will have a full recovery.  These situations come and go and they go on cycles as well.  Roosevelt was there at the right time.  The plans that he came up with should of never of lasted this long with all the free handouts.  People has taken total advantage of it and always will until we do something about it.

===message:Giving FDR broad executive power was definitely the last resort of the American government. It seemed that no other ideas had worked in jump-starting the American economy, so giving the President the power to impose economic policy was necessary at that point in history. FDR's "New Deal" may not have saved the country, but his forward thinking certainly got the economy headed in the right direction. He realized policies had to be created that would bring faith back to the American people relating to their outlook the future.
