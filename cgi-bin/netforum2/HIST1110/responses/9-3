===message:I agree with your statement that a lot of Americans were misrepresented in the segment; however, this segment was accurate with the majority of Americans.  Your opinion was correct because it was your opinion, but the segment said that the majority of the Americans were experiencing what the segment represented.  A better life for everyone, more opportunities, poverty was on a decline, the world was exploding with better appliances.  Yes, even MY mom did not have a washing machine in her family growing up until late 60’s, but majority of the world was able to eventually purchase better everyday domestic devices.  I agree, many people were not represented, but do not have such a negative outlook on the program.  It was basically allowing us to see how our economy and our world exploded after the war.  How over production was not a problem anymore.  How Americans (as a whole) had a better life than other parts of the world.

===message:Great response.  You identified the fact that there will always be different points of view for all situations, and that the depiction of the 1950's as prosperous is just not the same for everyone.  There are still people alive today who are living proof and are a witness to the fact that the 1950's was not prosporous for everyone.

===message:I agree partly with your thoughts on the video. The point of view that those interviewed expressed in the video would be different from the point of view of those not as positively affected by the "boom-time". The reality, though, is that, by and large, almost everybody prospered in the 1950’s - not just the elite. In Levittown, New York, houses were being sold at an astonishing rate of 40 per day. The down payment was 100 dollars (hardly a number for the so-called elite). I appreciate your analogy and I agree with it’s validity. But, I think, the context of this video was attempting to convey the vast economic growth of the 1950’s...... not to examine American social flaws.

===message:You are absolutely correct.  We all know that the 1950s' BOOM was not for everybody; but that was in the past. Things are much better now, and many people are benefitting from the good economy.

===message:I believe that there were several "groups" of people that did not prosper as well as might have been expected.  What is a $100 now, is much different than what a $100 was in 1950.  Not everyone had a hundred dollars for a down payment, let alone enough money to keep a household running.  And, even if you could afford a $100 down payment, your home was probably in the suburbs.  These individuals probably could not afford a car to commute to and from work.  Even though the American economy was prospering, does not mean that the "average" American was also.

===message:I agree with your comment about leaving out a good segment  of people, mainly minorities.  This is a great amount of people to leave out, but in America, it's nothing new.  Minority groups were left out.  The Civil Rights Movement had not yet started.  African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, as well as others, even women, had not yet began to receive their rights.  In the video, White Americans were shown as being prosperous after the war.  They were able to buy homes in the suburbs, make more money, and spend it as well.  Life was good in the 1950's, if you were one of the white Americans depicted in the video.
