===message:These two countries tried to outdo each other. They used whatever means necessary to portray each other in a bad light. They competed through the years of the Arms' race, and cold War, until the Berlin wall came down, and to the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  Judging by these happenings and for the fact that America's economy, and military power are stronger at this time, I should say that the United States worn in this power struggle.

===message:I agree with your comment about both sides basically mirroring each other.  The Soviets detested the US, and vice versa.  Both countries were pitted against each other and for good reasons.  They were both superpowers.  They both  wanted to outdo each other and in the process, they had to have the backing of their citizens.  So, they had to do whatever, use propaganda in films, music, and newspapers.
