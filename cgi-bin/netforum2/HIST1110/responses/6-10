===message:What do you mean by when you said that some of the athletes do go to jail, but that is society?  I wish I could agree with you that a few athletes could be considered role models, but I don't consider any of them role models for me or my children.  It is no longer good business it has become bad business not only because of the lack of most athlete's morals but most all sporting events have become big business to gamblers, as well.  This has caused games and boxing matches to be fixed.  Let's not forget what Pete Rose did.

===message:Debbie, what I meant by "that is society" is the change in the values of when Joe Louis and Babe Ruth were popular.  I also mean just because they are famous with alot of money does not make them any different from anyone else.  If they have a lack of morals and values, and make choices that land them in jail, they are the blame and only blame for it.  I also stated if I had to pick a athlete for a role model, which I would not, their are a few that I would put up for consideration.  I am glad that you would not pick professional athletes as role models for your children.  Parents, friends and family should be everybody's first choice for role models for their children but for many that is not the case.

===message:Debbie and Velkys, you need to realize that today one of the reason a child look up to a person is because of the amount of money he makes.  You have to see what a child sees.  Here is a person getting paid millions of dollars to play a game.  Name one person who wouldn't like that kind of job.  Also you have to consider that their are some children in this world that don't have the kind of family that they should be using as role model either.  A child that has been removed from his parents care because of abuse or neglect should not be looking to the family for role models.  I agree that some of today's athletes are not good role models, but their are a few.  What is wrong with Tiger Woods or Pete Sampras or the William sisters?

===message:Melanie, I can only speak for my own children by saying that your statement, "you need to realize that today one of the reasons a child looks up to a person is because of the amount of money he makes" I have to disagree.  My children look up to several people that don't make very much money.  As a matter of fact, I don't even let them know how much money anyone makes.  I shouldn't have to because there is no point in it.  I think that for this reason this is what is wrong with a lot of children today.  They are too educated in the wrong "subjects".  How much money a person makes should not be a child's concern nor is it any of their business.

===message:In today's sports many athletes are ending up in jail or in trouble for many questionable activites and situations.  Similarly, many of today's politicians are ending up in jail or in many immmoral acts.  Also, many buiness CEO's are ending up in many sticky situations.  These groups of people make choices, many of them wrong.  This does not refer to the majority of respectable professionals in each field, but the minority of "bad apples" who degrade their professions.  I think many of you are assuming the fallacy of "what is true for one can be extrapolated to the whole."  This is incorrect, illogial thinking.  In 2002, it was uncovered that many accountants participated in some unethical practices and underwent investigation by the justice department.  Does this mean that all accountants are corrupt? OF course not!  It would be riduculous to stop using accountants or boycott the stock market because of this.  Similarly a few basball player fielded accusations of steriod use this season, but does this mean all players use steriods?  No, that would be ridiculous.  In every aspect of life, a few immoral and unethical practices spoil the true worth of the field, and sports are no exception.

===message:Way to go on your original posting! I read your posting as well as all of the replies to you.  I am in complete agreeance with you on your statement about athletes being viewed in a completely different light than they are today.  Back then, people looked up to those athletes as heroes, and as defenders of their country.  These athletes provided an outlet for the american people when it was so desperately needed.  In today's world, we don't look at athletes as "defenders of the country," and we don't use them as propaganda for war.  As with all of the other replies, I think they read way too much in what you said.  I understood the point you were making, it was plain and simple : athletes today are not what they were back then, times are different and so is society.

===message:I am not talking about any Joe on the street.  You can turn on the news a hear what kind of contract some athlete has signed.  You can read and money magazine and see what top executives at corporations make.  It is every where.  I bet you know that Bill Gates is the richest man in America, not because you wanted to know or because you need to know but the information is out there.  I don't think that children should base there feelings or money.  My children don't know who much I make and they know that that is not something you ask people but they do know Bill Gates is the richest man in America and they also know that athletes today make millions of dollars.

===message:I agree that the athletes back then deserved much more respect than those of today.  The depression, WWII, the German communists, and unemployment concerns made their sport an escape for people.  Today's athletes only concern is about the amount of money they can make and how to flaunt their possessions.  The concern of the nation is very low on their list of priorities.  Maybe there is not as much to be concerned about right now, however, they could make a conscious effort to show some sort of support for their nation and adoring fans.
