===message:I agree, war is sometimes used as a last resort when a political solution is not gained.  Yet, as educated, well-rounded thinkers we all have to use deep discretion when deciding to engage in violence in our own lives and the same should be used in political situations as well.  If not, then one may reach a point of no return.

===message:Debbie, I totally agree with what you said. Janna, what happens when one country uses their good education and well roundedness and decides that they do not want to go into war with another country? What happens when a country tries to numerous times to negotiate with another country? Or what happpens when a leader of a country does not like the fact that we or anyone else is trying to negotiate with them and they decide to send terrorist over and bomb the country? Well are we then suppose to use are good education and well roundedness to be discrete about the situation? As Debbie said war is a last resort when all else fails; this is very sad but true.
