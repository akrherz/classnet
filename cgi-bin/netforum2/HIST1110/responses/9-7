===message:Edith, Im glad to see I was not the only person who viewed this film and felt the same way about the lives of americans in the 1950's.  It was interesting to see that the makers of the film only asked the opinions of people who had ideal and prosperous lives.  If a person who had no experience with the United States viewed this film they could get the impression (that many people already do) that life was wonderful and lovely in the U.S. during the 50's for all americans.

===message:Edith, your absolutely right in saying that this film did not highlight the fact that not all people were prospering during this time.  In order to get a truly accurate picture of the times, they should have touched more on the economic plight of African Americans and other minorities.

===message:Edith, I agree with most of what you are saying.  However, not all white people had a lot of money.  People without a lot of money still enjoyed a good family centered life.  It was a time of wholesomeness.  Movies and television were not even allowed to show married couples in the same bed.  The majority of families were two parent families. Parent's attitudes toward their children in school was certainly much different in the 50's.  Parents taught their children respect for teachers and other adults.  The parents supported the teachers; they didn't want to always blame the teacher or sue them.  Even though the fifties was a wonderful time for most children to grow up let's not forget that the minorites were still oppressed.

===message:I agree with your responses because it is true that minorities were not depicted in the segment.  If one notices during the segment, only white Americans were depicted.  Therefore, this shows that this "prosporous" lifestyle was enjoyed mostly by white Americans and not minorities.

===message:The video excludes minorities, but also gives the impression that all whites enjoyed the boom time.  In the 1950s there were white slums in the northeast cities.  The NYC melting pot was typically an overpopulated slum filled with whites, African-Americans, and Puerto Ricans sharing abject poverty.  Buildings were decades old with numerous families living in different apartments in which heat generated from radiators often failed to work.  Washing machines were in, but dryers were clotheslines hanging from windows in the tenement courtyard.  Air conditioning was a rooftop or a fire escape.  Transportation was feet, the bus or the train as few had cars.  Entertainment was stickball in the street.  Don't sound to booming to me.

===message:Most of the time like this segnent depicts is about the majority of people.  Most people in America really didn't care about the underprivilged.  That is why the segment is more focused on the prosperity of the people instead of the homeless and the ghettos.

===message:I know it is a very sensitive issue when we talk about race in this country, and I also know that people forget so easily.  Those who felt they were left out on things would feel differently from those not affected.  It is a fact we also had other ethnic groups who were poor and did not enjoy the boom time, and to think that we have in this America to this day, places where some people are still using the “Traditional latrine system” instead of the water system, and they are supposedly living in a land of “plenty?”.  This is just a history class where the instructor asked us to narrate what was recorded, hence my mention of poor minorities and blacks; I hope it did not sound offensive to anyone. May I extend my regards to those of you who saw things as they were.  It’s been a fun class.  Hope we all make “A”s.

===message:I agree with what you said except the fact of: "for the majority, that account was accurate."  I don't think even the majority of the American population enjoyed what was depicted on television.  I believe this was another form of propaganda to allow Europe to think American life was wonderful.  Yes the American economy did improve drastically, but I don't think the majority of American people had a "piece of this pie."
