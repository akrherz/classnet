===message:Kristen, I can agree with some of what you said, however, I am still not a fan of FDR.  You are right about the programs that were started during the depression, but I believe that is when some Americans began to be too dependent on the government for assistance.  You can probably tell that I am not a fan of welfare.  I have been in a position where I could have certainly used some extra assistance, but fortunately at that point in time there was no depression.  I can honestly say that at that time I was single with two children to support.  I didn't look for help from the government, I helped myself by going out and finding a job.  Yes, times were a lot different than during the depression.  I completely understand that people during the depression needed help from the government, but it did seem to start some type of a chain reaction that is still with us today during a time of no depression.

===message:Debbie, I understand what you are saying, and I agree with you for the most part. You have to understand that when I was writing my response to "Breadline", I was not considering our government today. What instead struck me was the all the suffering that America went through during the Great Depression. You know, those videos really paint for me such vivid pictures of those landmark times in history. At the time of the Depresion, if a man wanted a job, he mostly likely would not find one, whereas today anybody who has the initiative to get a job can get up and go to work. I'm with you when you say that our current government is way too free in how it distributes its social funds. My feelings are that our government should reserve such financial help for the gravist of needs.  As for FDR, I think he was just what the nation needed at the time of the depression because he wasn't afraid to take action and take risks in order to help a dying economoy. So, even though I do not advocate big government, I can see that there is a time and a place for it. Do you really think that such a passive president like Hoover could have ever gotten America out of the slump? What do you think would have been best for the country? I am interested to learn from my fellow classmates.
