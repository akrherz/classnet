===message:I definitely agree with you.  Sports became a much needed escape from the tragedies of war and hardship experienced worldwide.  It is evident that the attributes we valued in athletes are not as prevalent in sports today.

===message:The athletes of today like the ones that you mentioned are still bad role models.  Children look at these athletes and think that they can be one of them.  When the odds are so far from accomplishing it.  Especially minorites look up to these people and don't have other avenues to go down.  They do poorly in school and try to put all there efforts in being a professional athlete.
