===message:The country was certainly not prospering, nor did we feel invincible. Americans found themselves in a depression after the stock market crash of the late twenties that we endured for 12 years. In fact, it was the second war that you hinted of that brought the economy back into a state of prosperity. The cause of the war was the overconfidence of Hitler and Nazi-Germany. The cause of the war was an overconfident French military that found itself over-run. The cause of the war was England’s denial that war would even begin. The cause of the war was the inefficiencies of the League of Nations. The cause of the war was not, however, the idea that America, with low moral and a declining economy, was invincible. 

Incidentally, no country COULD touch us, at least not for long.

===message:World War I was fought on the "home front" as well as on the battle. Many of the civilians died due to malnutrition, since the blockade of food supplies was cut off and where the still-developing economy could not cope with both war and normal requirements.
World War I was caused by the deliberate aggression of evil leaders, which had the key to preventing future wars. Peace could be maintained by preventing people with such intentions from obtaining power.
In one sense, World War I was the result of a series of apparently reasonable calculations, as national leaders decided that each new step toward war was preferable to a backward step that implied national humiliation or isolation.

===message:When then war was over, so many people wanted an explanation of its origins. People found themselves in a depression after the stock market cash in the late twenties, but it was the second war that put the economy back on track. At the same time, war settled some questions about inequalities of civil rights based on birth or sex.
The disciplined fashion in which millions had marched to their death showed that power was virtually unbounded.

===message:I do agree that everyone involved in World War I thought that this kind of war would never happen again.  I dont think the next war came about from the belief that we were invincible.  The United States took the stance of Containment.  We isolated ourselves from the rest of the world because of World War I.
