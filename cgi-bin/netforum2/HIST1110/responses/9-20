===message:Life was great for a number of individuals in the video.  They had no worries of money, they were now being paid more.   They were able to move into suburban areas and buy homes.  The people of the 1950s were soaking up their prosperity.  However, the only people shown were in white America.  What happened to all the minorities?  Were they gone in the 1950s?
