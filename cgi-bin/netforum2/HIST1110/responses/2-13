===message:I agree with you to a certain extent.  I do think that things are better off today for African Americans globally, however, in the U.S., there is still a lot of discrimination towards people of color on so many levels.  In other countries, things such as the color of a person's skin, or their social class, doesn't reign supreme. I know this from living in different countries where my color was not the determining factor of how I was treated. Now I am not saying that in the U.S. things haven't gotten better for African Americans.  I do acknowledge that people do have the right to vote, speak freely, go to school, and hold better jobs. So I guess I agree with you when you say things have gotten a little better, but there is still a long way to go.  As far as technology goes, the world has gotten far better than it was a hundred years ago.  We have advanced so much economically in industries such as transportation and computers.  Diseases are much more curable now than they were a hundred years ago.  Not only do we now have the ability to be cured from some diseases, we have prevention and treatment. I do agree that things such as crime and drugs, have gotten a lot worse.  I think that has to do with the world becoming so populated. It's hard to answer a question like this with a straight answer, because it is a matter of opinion.  I'd say things have gotten better on some levels, and worse on others.
