===message:That’s a fascinating viewpoint Gena. I’ll bet it was interesting hearing your husband’s perspective on the war and the viewpoint of different cultures such as Norway and Sweden, and even Germany.  At the time, German civilization had been viewed by Germans and other cultured Europeans as the zenith of human accomplishment. German science, German music and art, German scholarship, and German philosophy had set standards for the rest of the world. And now the German was hated by the world as a primitive, barbaric savage. As a civilization he was referred to as the Hun, the hated name that had stood for centuries as the type of uncivilized, brutal, semi human being who had swept into Europe from the East and devastated the Roman world. “Let us hope that they are wrong,” said one distinguished German, “and that we Germans are not as bad as they think we are.” But he added, “We are not as good as we would like them to think we are, either. We are human, and they are too.”

===message:Yes it is interesting to hear his viewpoint on War. Sweden has never fought in a World War but they fought for 100s of years with other surrounding countries like Norway, Demark,France,Holland and Germany. The Vikings actually came to America during the times before and of Christopher Columbus and had some villages on the coast. They never made anything of them because they where killed off by the Native Americans.

===message:World War I became a watershed in history due to its sheer violence.  In an age of unprecendented technoledgy and ingenuity, the world began probably the most atrocious war it had ever seen.  The introduction of several technological breakthroughs forced countries involved in World War I to suffer more loss than ever seen.  The machine gun, the tank, and some forms of aviation began to introduce themselves to the battlefields.  These new machines promised a very bloody stalemate as conventional fighting strategy was now ineffective.  
    The War taught the human race some very important trappings to avoid in the future.  The entanglement of complex alliences was a main cause of the war.  These "under-the-table" pacts resulted in a world wide entanglement in which each country was caught up in unofficial treaties to protect one another.  This has proved to be a poor policy toward global affairs.  The United States itself has learned that neutrality is not a safe foreign policy.  World War I made U.S. political officials (and world leaders) realize that we had moved into a global society, and our global interrelatedness doesn't allow for true isolationism. This is how anti-war activists who had some pull in the government tried to keep the U.S. out of the war.  Sooner or later, as we later learned, we will be forced into it.  The sinking of the Lusatania, the Zimmerman note, and other anti-U.S. events brought upon us the need to involve ourselves.  Not to jump ahead, but similar events in World War II, like the bombing of Pearl Harbor again brought us out of our neutrality.  World War I changed the way that wars are fought, introducing twentieth century technoledgy to the world through death and destruction, while also changing worldly political views on foriegn policy as it truly showed us that we were suddenly a lot more interrelated than we thought.  This War is truly the watershed of history into modern thinking, while also proved to be the awakening of the human race.
