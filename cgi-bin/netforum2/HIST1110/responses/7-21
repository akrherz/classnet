===message:Gena, I've never sen that movie, as ask the same questions you asked. The more I think about it the more I feel like,yes, when a person tries to pick what kind of child they have that is playing God. There has been in the news stories about genetic engineering, and I think what is this world coming to. People should be happy that God gave them the ability to even have children, so they should not try to alter anything. Instead of trying to conceive the "perfect" child, people should focus their attention on more positive and constructive things in life. If God wanted all perfect people he would have made us all that way. The only perfect person is God and that will never change.

===message:I also had to watch the movie "Gattaca" for Psyc 1101. I never even correlated the Germans with genetic reengineering.  You are right though.  People who select what their child will look like, what sex the baby will be, if and when to terminate a fetus with a defect are trying to play God.  They are trying to make a "better" person just as Hitler was playing God by trying to make a "better" race.  There is no difference then by allowing genetic reengineering (for personal gain) or trying to eliminate all those who are not the "norm" (blond hair, blue eyes). Great point!

===message:Think about this:  Plastic surgery.  The world is consistantly trying to make their bodies perfect, their faces perfect, their teeth perfect.  In a way, not just genetically, have we all been following Hitlers' gameplan to create a perfection in the human race?

===message:That's a great point Will.  Everyone is constantly trying to alter themselves, either with weight loss/gain, plastic surgery, or age-defying techniques. If you turn on the television, what do you see?  Young, beautiful, perfect smile, perfect hair, perfect bodied individuals.  This is what is posted every where. Go to any store and look at the covers of magazines.  Look at movie stars and singers. This is the image given to people of what "beautiful" is suppose to be.  Hitler had the same ideas of "beautiful" Germans:  healthy, fit, blue-eyed, blond hair people.  I see a strong correlation-how about you?

===message:I think your analogy of creating a master race to that of genetic engineering is a good one.  Hitler tried to create a master race the old fashioned way.  In Gattaca, they were able to pick out all of the good genes and bad ones to create the perfect child.  That is a good example of trying to create a master race.  I would definitely say that it is harmful.
