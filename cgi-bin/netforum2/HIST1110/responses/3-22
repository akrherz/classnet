===message:I agree.  After WWI the world totally changed its views about everything.  Going into WWI the solders believed that the war would be over in a couple days.  After the second year and millions dead the harsh realization of how devestating war truly was.  The industrialization of war made mass destruction possible and created a horrible trend for war.  Later before WWII veterans' children from WWI were forced to face the same horrible fate as their elders.  No real actions helped to stop this war.  Although a unification of all countries was attempted the war was enevitable.
