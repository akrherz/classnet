===message:Yes I agree that it was  lucky for us that the Soviets were wrong, but I do not think it is based solely on luck.
I think that basically  most people want to live in a free society  where they can express themselves without fear of reprisals if their thoughts are not the same as John Q Publics. People want to know that their labors 
are being rewarded and not necessarily all on the same level. I think the Russian experiment with communism was a failure because the people were tired of never getting anywhere and the cost of trying to subject other nations to the communist way of life was too much for them.
