===message:Shameeka made a stong point.  Athlete's personal lives are too often taken into consideration when they are being discussed.  When discussing athletes, I think that the dialogue should be restricted to performance issues and not personal problems.  I agree Ms. Beckett.

===message:I agree that athletes should be admired for their dedication to their sport and for the hard work it takes to keep their skills at top level. Unfortunately professional athletes are celebraties and their personal lives may not be our business but the media seems to make it their business to notify the public when one of their idols slips up.
