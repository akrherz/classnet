===message:When you say that before WWI, people thought of wars as being fought with single shot rifles and that these rifles slowed down the number of casualties.  There were more soldiers killed in the Civil War.  The number of casualties during that war has never been surpassed by any other war.  The above mentioned weapons were also used in that war.  I do agree with you that a lot of people tried to forget about the horrors of the war and think of the future.  They also think of building a better life.

===message:Let's keep in mind that the term "casualties" refers to the total people wounded AND killed. The term "fatalities" refers to the total people killed.  I am not sure if the Civil War had more casualties than any other war in America, but it certainly did not have as many casualties worldwide as World War I.

===message:Yes your right about a new kind of war.  It was a total shock to the soldiers of how gruesome and hard war actually was in reality.
