===message:Hi Doug, I will have to agree with you that this is kind of  a half and half situation.  Just as the text stated, in so many words, that 100 years ago, humankind was afraid of nature.  Today, nature is afraid of humankind.  I do like the fact that at the age I am today (in my 30's) that I am not considered an old lady or a spinster.  Thanks to today's
technology age 90 is considered old age.

===message:Doug....I agree with your statements wholeheartedly. I was especially intrigued by your comments on the possibility of nuclear war. The impatience of overbearing leaders to enter into the world stage causes them to act hastily and without practicality. Do you think, for one second, that Saddam Hussein will hesitate to evince his nuclear weapons when he acquires some Uranium? No. In the mind of a dictatorial ruler of a small middle-eastern country, nothing could serve his cause better than to thrust his country, and himself, into the spotlight of international affairs. Luckily, Iraq has no ICBM’s. However, China does possess long range nukes and seem to have, in some capacity, motives to support the cause of the so called "Islamic Jihad". I often wonder what it would be like to learn that one or several ICBM’s are on their way to the United States, and anticipating their trajectories. What a terrible feeling that would be. That is precisely why I believe, and fortunately the current administration agrees, that the only way to defend ourselves is preemptive action.

===message:While I do agree with you that the world has problems with depleted natural resources and that the advancement in medicine has it pros and cons, I must say that there has been some good that has come from the advancements of today.  Look at all of the diseases that have been cured and treated.  Look at how far we have come as far as technology goes.  Look at how far we have come as a human race.  No one can expect to live in a perfect world.  Let's face it, it doesn't exist here on Earth.  It doesn't now and it didn't 100 years ago.  We all have one thing that we didn't back then, and that is opportunity.  We have the opportunity to change the things that are bad, and make them better.  I do agree that 100 years ago we didn't have to worry about pollution or population, but I wouldn't trade places with the people of 100 years ago.  When I watched the first episode, they showed several people that have lived through a number of wars.  I couldn't imagine living the life of those people.  Things have gotten better over the past 100 years, let us not be blind to all the positive advancements.
