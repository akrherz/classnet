===message:The alliance of the Soviet Union, Great Britian, and the United States began to weaken even before World War II ended. Conflicts over the future of Germany and Eastern Europe surfaced at wartime conferences.
After the war, the Soviet Union guaranteed its dominance of Eastern Europe by establishing communist governments there. Through the policy of containment, the United States acted to prevent further Soviet expansion. By the early 1950s, most of Europe was divided into two military alliances-NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
The nations of Western Europe recovered rapidly from the destruction of the war. Economic cooperation through the Common Market contributed to prosperity in the 1950s and 1960s. In the Soviet Union, Stalin restored totalitarian rule after the war. Khrushshev introduced a period of relaxed controls following Stalin's death.

===message:Kristen, I think you have given a great overview of the video and I agree with your opinions.  I believe my opinions on the Soviets and the Americans are the same as yours.  To me these propagandas (both American and Soviet) were typical of one country wanting everyone to think that they are the best and that their enemy is not.  Propaganda has been used by countries for years as a brainwashing system to keep their people under control.

===message:Yeah. To be honest, propaganda can be a very scary thing to me. Even though I know it is somewhat necessary ( to prevent a panic of the masses), it seems scary to think ( just as i said earlier) that what hear and see in the news is all most of us ever know about a situation. This sometimes makes me think if the whole bin laden thing. Its pretty obvious that our government does not tell us everything they know about a situation

===message:Kristin, It’s interesting to see how the Soviet and American soldiers (every day average people) were ready to join hands and celebrate together at the meeting on the Elbe.  This shows you the intent of the masses of people on both sides were kindly and good.  It’s unfortunate that Stalin and his comrades stifled this connection by outlawing any mention of how things really were during this event and in fact, turned it around to show just the opposite.  This is a very scary piece of false propaganda that reminds me to always check out the facts before believing any piece of news. Wouldn't you agree?

===message:Wendy- I totally agree with you. The whole propaganda thing can be very scary. I agree that we should always take time to do some research so as to not jump to conclusions based on what we are told by the media or the government for that matter.

===message:Thanks for your comments. I agree, you really identified  key expamples from Episode 11 which accurately depict the US and the Soviet Union's change in views of each other.  It is astonishing how much propoganda plays a role in how  we think or view other countries and their people.

===message:Thank you for your reply Janna. The idea that propaganda is such a powerful method of mind control just blows my mind. I wonder what the US and Soviet reactions would have been had they actually seen this footage of American and Soviet soldiers embracing and sharing and rejoicing together at the war's end? Do you think that history could have turned out differently?

===message:Yes Wendy, I totally agree that Stalin interfered in what might have been a continuously happy peacetime for America and the Soviet Union. This particular depiction makes it quite obvious that the dictators and other powerful office holders, rather than the people of the country tend to start these wars that so purposely claim countless lives on the battlefields and inside the walls of towns filled with innocent civilians...often I can't help but wonder, "why do the nations rage?"

===message:I found it very interesting how you included the "Operation Vittle" situation as a way for the United States to make themselves look good in the eyes of europe.  I sad to think that the real reason behind helping the German people was the "cold war" between the soviets and americans and not the americans wanting to help the Germans out of kindness.  It was just another form of propaganda the americans used.
