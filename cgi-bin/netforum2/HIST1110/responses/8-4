===message:Doug, You have a given a great overview.  You are right on the money with this.  This is the best concise contrast and comparison that I have read.  I particularly like your explanation about the distorted theory that the US and the Soviets were becoming more and more alike when in fact the Soviet economy was indeed inefficient.  The average Russian citizen stood in line for hours for food, clothing, firewood, and many other basic commodoties.  Some were lucky and went home with something while others left empty handed.
