===message:Your message pointed out an important advancement that at first, I failed to consider.  I believe that the civil rights movement is the greatest advancement in the the past 100 years.  Minorities now have a significant chance to be seen as equal, and can take advantage of all the opportunities the world provides.  That is so important to me that I too wouldn't trade that for cleaner air or more trees.
