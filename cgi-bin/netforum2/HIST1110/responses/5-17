===message:Yes indeed, President Roosevelt was the best they had at that time.  Being a good leader with vision, he put programs in place that eventually helped the nation get out of depression, and I think majority of people in this country loved him.  I also think that president Hoover did'nt just know what to do, hence he said for people to "let the depression run it's course"  That statement he made showed poor leadership on his part.

===message:You made a lot of good points.  I especially like and agree with your comment on the government creating jobs and the people having income.  Once they felt stabilized, they were able to start spending money again to get the economy back on track.  I also agree with your comment on how the New Deal was the best deal at that time.  At a time when no one else was doing anything to rehabilitate the economy, Roosevelt stepped in and became a saving grace.  While I don't think he "saved the country," I do believe he put it back on the road to recovery.
