===message:I agree with your comment about the military leaders and them not experiencing "war" on the same level as the soldiers.  I think that's probably why the battles lasted so long and so many died.  The military leaders were not at the battlefronts and did not see the actual death and destruction.  In a way they probably started to regard the men as pieces to the war not actual living and breathing human beings.  When one country was behind in a battle and 500 men were lost, they would just send 500 more into battle to gain ground.  I'll use an analogy of a car and the fuel it burns in order to run.  In order to keep a car running, you put fuel in the gas tank.  The military leaders may have seen the soldiers as fuel for their war.  They had to keep the battles running in order to win the war no matter the cost.

===message:I think the both of you are right on point with what you said. It's like when you see something terrible happen on TV or maybe just happen anywhere, you begin to think "Man that looks bad" but when your actually invovled in whats happening you begin to think and analyze the situation at a whole other level. The leader or dictator had no problem with sending his people out because it wasn't him, he could care less about what was happening because he was not directly affected(meaning his life or well-being) only those of his people.
