===message:World War I killed and wounded millions of soldiers worldwide, the rest died of influenza and other diseases.
The war's social, political, economic, and technological impact extended far beyond the battlefield. Many of the technologies of slaughter that would dominate in the rest of the century emerged: torpedoes, bombs, toxic gases, and deadly efficient machine guns. The war furthered the goals of some reformers, bringing to fruition the women-suffrage and prohibition movements, for example. Government regulation of corporations expanded in the name of economic mobilization, and laws were passed to promote war workers' well-being and efficiency. Ultimately, however, the war undermined the progressive movement's commitment to social justice and its humanitarian concern for the underdog. When Americans repudiated Wilsonian idealism after the war, they also rejected reform. Internationally, the conflict propelled the United States to the center of world politics and left the nation's businesses and financial institutions poised for global expansion.
Some of these changes endured; others were fleeting. Their cumulative effect was profound. The United States that celebrated the armistice in 1918 was a very different society from the one that Wilson had summoned to war only nineteen months earlier.
