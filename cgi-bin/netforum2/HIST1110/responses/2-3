===message:I agree with you that in the medical field, technology, and education have made people's lives better today.  However, some of the technology has created dangerous cituations, such as guided missles that could cause our civilization, as we know it, to be dead.  It makes me wonder whether it is an improvement or not.  You made several great points about today's technology, but as far as the family togetherness is concerned we hardly have that anymore.  It is kind of like a catch 22.

===message:I’ll attempt to abide by the rules of netiquette in my response. Yet, I am appalled at the examples that you provide for society’s advancements Veronica. Granted, landing on the moon was the most complete and dazzling affirmation to that date of the belief that man lives in a universe he can manage. The instruments of doing so that were once magic and prayer are now science and technology. Landing on the moon was more or less comparable to the mastery of fire, the invention of agriculture, or the discovery of nuclear power. However, computer games and body enhancements do not constitute a better quality of life, nor are they good examples of the advancement of mankind.

===message:I like to thank you Doug for your netiquette to my responses. I'm so sorry that you are appalled by my examples. I'm glad you do agree on some of my examples. No, computer games and body enhancements do not constitute a better quality of life but it also shows how far medical and technological advances has increased in the advancement of mankind.

===message:Technology do have their pros and cons, but it is how we use our technology that causes great improvement in our world.
As for as the family togetherness that is a very important issue. Family togetherness is no longer important, with the high economy, lack of job income, and divorce which put heavy burden on families there is no more unity in families.
And you are right, its has a lot to do with catch 22.

===message:Veronica all of those material things you listed are technological advancements that all people do not have access to.  If you are someone that grew up well off, yes these things are great and make your life more comfortable.  What is the point of medical advancements if every person does not have access to it? What is the point of computers, video games and email if children are not educated well enough to read the emails or read the directions to the games?

===message:Are our lives better today than a century ago?

Today's world is full of unbelievable breakthorughs in all fields.  The exponetial growth of technoledgy has spurred a revolution in every aspect of modern life from the way we communitcate to the way we wash our clothes.  It seems nothing is the same as it was a hundred years ago.  In those days, times were simpler, life was focused around family and hard work, life expectancy was low, and many died as a result of things easily preventable by today's technoledgy.  Over the course of the past century, the world has produced great ideas.  Also, in the past decade man has made many mistakes.  The difference between life in 2002 and life in 1902 is the result of changes made to correct our mistakes.  In World War I, the powderkeg that erupted over the various treaties and aliiances created a messy entanglement that cost a lot of human loss and suffering in the early 1900's.  The correction became apparent as the League of Nations is formed, the precursor of the United Nations, who has benefited communication among foreign leaders.  The stock market crash of 1929 spurred the Great Depression and crushed the world's economy as a result.  Today, many factors are in place to prevent this type of economic downfall.  Improved use of constrictonary and expansionary monatary policies are a direct result of this tragedy, and will prevent this in the future.  Furthermore, the development of several vaccines has improved our longetivity and health care.  Great Understanding of our world has both stemmed from higher education and pushed it.  Mass lieracy around the world has improved the ordinary citizens knowledge of society, politics, and made available great work options for the average American.  
   These changes have improved our society over the last one hundred years.  Medical marvels, technological breakthroughs, and engineering wonders has secured the human soverignty over the animals, and instilled in us both vast wonder and child-like amazement.  Life has improved through progress.

===message:I completely disagree with Doug. I feel that many of the technological advances Veronica listed do constitute a better quality of life. Your life may not be better because of these technologies, although many other people may have a better quality of life because of these technologies. These technological advancements are good examples of the advancement of mankind. There are numerous different ways to judge the advancement of mankind, but to say technology improvements are not one of them is ridiculous.
