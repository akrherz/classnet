===message:I totally agree with you that media is known for its tendency to twist the facts in order to provoke a certain response. I also thought that the statement that media can underplay or overplay a situation was very true. Thinking about such ideas, make us as civilians feel very uninformed about the many things that our government agencies must be covering up from the American public daily. We only hear and see what they want us to.

===message:The 1952 election ended two decades of Democratic control of the White House and closed the first phase of the Cold War, in which an assertive United States, eager to proect and expand its influence and power, faced off against a Soviet Union obsessed with its own security and self-interest. In the name of containment, the United States aided Greece and Turkey, established the Marshall Plan, airlifted supplies into Berlin, approved the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany(West Germany), established NATO, and went to war in Korea.
American fear of global communism spawned anxiety about domestic communism. Truman's own Cold War rhetoric encouraged others to seek scapegoats for the failure of the United States to get its way everywhere in the world and legitimated conservative accusations that equated dissent with disloyalty. This Red Scare, combined with economic prosperity and pent-up demand for consumer goods, weakened attempts at liberal reform. New Deal reforms stood, but Truman's attempts to gain education, health insurance, and civil-rights reforms failed. When Eisenhower assumed the presidency, Americans saw his infectious grin as a sign of better times ahead.

===message:The Cuban crisis had shown the world that the United States was top dog. America had then enjoyed superior military strength, support of allies around the world, and the public will to sustain a world diplomatic and military effort while still dealing with huge domestic problems. By 1980 many Americans felt the world had changed and were unhappy about it. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 many of his supporters looked back on a decade of what seemed increasing American powerlessness. He inherited an enormous budgetary deficit, disappointment over what looked like recent successful initiatives by the Russians in Africa and Afghanistan, and dismay over what was believed to be the disappearance of superiority in nuclear weapons the United States had enjoyed in the 1960’s. In the next 5 years Reagan was to restore the morale of America by remarkable (even if only cosmetic) feats of leadership. Symbolically, on the day of his inauguration, the Iranians released their hostages. This was by no means the end of problems American policy faced in the Middle East and the Gulf. Two fundamental difficulties did not go away. The threat posed to international order in that area by Cold War attitudes and the question of Israel. Reagan took advantage of Gorbachev’s arrival in power. Discussion of arms reduction was renewed and agreements were reached on other issues as well. Yet, in America’s domestic politics, a huge and still growing budgetary deficit, and a flagging economy, which would under most presidents have produced political uproar, were for years virtually lost to sight in the euphoria produced by a seeming transformation of the international scene. The alarm and fear of the “evil empire” had begun to evaporate. Optimism and confidence grew and Russia showed signs of growing division and difficulty in reforming its affairs.

===message:Yes, it seems as if both the Soviet Union and the US believed and convinced its citizens that the other country was evil.  The Soviet Union and the US had different economic systems and ways of life, as a result differences between the two countries probably were destined to occur.

===message:I do agree that both countries depicted the other in negative ways.  I disagree that the United States depicted the Soviet Union as an evil that would destroy the world.  The propaganda the americans used depicted the Soviet Union as a power that if allowed to spread its form of rule would turn its citizens in to living robots.  No one would have a say in the way they lived and thought.  One government one nation would rule for the benefit of many people.

===message:I agree completely. For every time there was media coverage of an international threat, there were probably several others situations that U.S. citizens knew nothing about. Even though the movie "Thirteen Days" was a dramatization, one can get a sense of how our safety hung in the balance of Cold War by watching it. My Grandparents have lived in the same house for 50 years. At the end of the house, under the foundation, were the uncompleted beginnings of a bomb shelter. It was dug by my Grandfather who had served in the Pacific in WWII. Certainly he understood the dangers of any nuclear aggression. And as for the propaganda, I think it fueled the entire situation. When I was nine or ten, my parents bought me my first camouflage outfit as most boy’s parents did in America did in the early 80’s. Accompanying the green, cargo-style pants with the drawstring in the cuffs was a solid black T-shirt. On the front it read, " United States of America : Defend it......or learn to speak Russian". Today, that seems slightly odd. But, at the time, even as a young boy playing "War" with my friends, I recognized Russia as "American Enemy Number One".

===message:That was interesting to read about the camouflage suit you got. Although I guess we don't think about Russia being a threat anymore since they are no longer the USSR, it was interesting to read that even in the 80s we still thought them as a threat in some sort of way. Today we have a new USSR though, the Middle East. It seems like someone is always trying to challenge the USA. The difference I think now though is with Russia it was political power. They where not the radical religous groups that we are dealing with in the Middle East. With Russia we where dealing with Military tactics. Now we are dealing with religous fanatics that will die for their beliefs. There is no talking to them. They are much more dangerous then any Russian ever was.
