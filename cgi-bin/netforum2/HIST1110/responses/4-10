===message:Kristin , I agree with you that pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiation are wonderful and do help in some instances but that political leaders are not good and unselfish enough to utilize them to prevent any future wars.  For instance, Adolph Hitler was a very prideful man.  He believed that the Arian Germanic race should rule the world and look at the destruction his pride and prejudice caused us.  We cannot naively believe that the hearts of the world’s political leaders are always good all the time and we must constantly keep them in check or face the consequences.

===message:Wendy, 
  That's right. Hitler greatly abused power and took advantage of disarmament and those who had faith in this concept. As we see, as WWII approached, Hitler was rearming Germany while many other countries were naively unaware, still trusting that all was well and that the world would stay in a peace time.  Unfortunately, by the time world leaders realized what was going on, it was too late to stop Hitler who had now successfully hypnotized his nation. So, yes I agree that with the possibility of a corrupt leaders coming to power, ,it is our responsibility to stay aware as to what is going on in our government.

===message:I think in a way both of you answered the last question, if pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiation would ever prevent war from happening again....and I believe the answer is no. For an example, Hitler did violate the disarmamnent law put against him and the rest of the world was disillusioned by him and trusted him. Then the ending result WWII. In today's world I don't think that any leader would give up their weapons because they do not want to leave themselves vulnerable to any other country. Take Saddam for instance, he was supposively not producing weapons of mass destruction anymore. And come to find out he is doing what he said he wasn't. Leaders of other countries are probably thinking if they get rid of their weapons then how do they know that the other country is getting rid of theirs. And how do they know that other country will not invade them after their weapons are all gone. Due to this lack of trust( and rightfully so) no one will ever abide by the rules of disarmament.

===message:I agree with your reasoning about the causation of war.  However, I think that more than pride being a reason for invading a smaller country, nations invade because of greed.  They want to expand their country because in doing so, they can gain more territory, hence, having more to rule and occupy. I think that is when the security of a country becomes threatened.  The soldiers from "All Quiet on the Western Front" did express sarcasm, but when the one soldier explained the cause of war, I agreed.  One country offends another, and then war is almost inevitable.  Pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiations, probably do more for the people and satisfying their own conscience, but I don't think it is helpful to a nation that is already offended.

===message:Shameeka, I agree with you that greed is very much a cause of war. I guess when I was thinking about my answer I was actually thinking of pride as a broader category that encompasses such evils as pride, or jealousy, and so on. Thank you for your input. I will definitely think next time before I answer in such a general context.

===message:Ebony, I agree with you that the final answer to the big question is no. I totally agree with the point that leaders of countries will not disarm because they don't ever want to be unprepared. Take 9/11 for example, the US hadn't disarmed or anything, but were surely not prepared for that now infamous attack. I also agree with your example regarding Sadam Hussain; we did so naively believe that our negotiations had been successful and here he is again threatening our security. I think it is really cool how we learn and expand our thinking as we discuss the history of our world and how it relates to us today.

===message:Thank you for your reply, and thank you for respecting my opinion.  I do agree with you on your statement about pride.  It was a very broad statement, however, I just tried to pick one aspect of it and went with it.  You did make some good points in your original posting and I'm glad you were able to read my statement and respect it.  Thank you.
