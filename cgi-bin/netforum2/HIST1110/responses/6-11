===message:Wouldn't it be nice if it were true that athletes only did 1% of bad things.  Today they are so over paid and their egos so over inflated that most of them think the law does not apply to them.  I remember a time that I used to love to go watch as many games as I could, but now I am so disgusted with the majority of them.  I agree with you that Babe Ruth was a drunk and a womanizer, but as far as I know he never committed a crime.  So many athletes today think they are above the law, have no sense of morals, and have committed some serious crimes.  They've really gone over the line with their morals, of which they are lacking.  I would hope that Max McGee would not be allowed to "suit up" as you stated, but I really think they would have allowed him to play because there is no crime in playing football while intoxicated.  On what grounds could they stop him?  Maybe they would give him a PFUI.....playing football under the influence....who knows.

===message:I agree that professional athletes are held up to a higher standard then the general public.  Because of that, I think seem people actually get a kick out of watching them fail in their personal lives.  I think you said it perfectly about their personal lives not being focused on as much in the past.  I guess it comes with the more money you make the more famous you become the more people want to know about you.

===message:Eric, I have to agree with Debbie on this one.  If normal everyday people do more than 1% bad things, what makes famous athletes any better than the little people?  Instead of playing the game for the love of the sport, they play to win and to make money.  Unfortunately, this is put first place for many athletes, and trying to be a role model is placed second, third, and so on.  If you work hard at becoming famous and want to be a celebrity, then you must accept the responsibilities that come with it.  If you don’t have your act together, how can you put yourself on display in front of the world?

===message:Sports figures should be role models and some are.  Women's basketball is a great example of that.  However, the questions posed were unfair because the modern day individuals have negative connotations, rightfully so.  Look at the UCONN Women's National Championship team from last year.  Great Rolemodels for females and males.  They recieved scholarships and no more.

===message:Eric, I have to agree with everyone else on this matter. I think more than just 1% do bad things. It's just so often that you hear about an athlete doing something bad that people just tend to forget about one and move on to the other. I do not think that it is fair that athletes commit a crime and get away with it just because they have money. If they are just regular people(which they are but are not seen as such) then they should get regular people punishment. So many athletes are caught with drugs and do they go to jail? No. If any regular Joe was caught with drugs they would be sent to jail automatically. Instead these athletes go around and around with fine payments and rehab. Now how fair is that? Would you want your young children or siblings to look up to these kind of people? You would hope that they would look up to the percent that do positive things but that's not only the case. Athletes tend to focus more on how much much money they make and not on how a real role model or public figure should act.

===message:Athletes are always going to be role models for the children that watch sports with a passion. These athletes are going to be involved in situations that provide a good example for children, and athletes will provide a bad example for children at times. No one is perfect and when a high profile athlete makes a minor mistake it will be magnified. It is up to parents to help children understand that athletes are human and they make mistakes just like common people. Parents have to be a role model for their children as well and not let sports figures be their childrens only role model.
