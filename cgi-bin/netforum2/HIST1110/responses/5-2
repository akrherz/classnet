===message:I agree with most of what you said in your discussion.  Roosevelt actually "jump-started" the ideas that led America to being a world economic power; because of this, I would agree with Mancil Miligan's remarks that president Roosevelt saved the country.  It takes being a good man and good leadership to revive a country, and entry into World War 11 only helped quicken that recovery. His government intervened to help the people when they were in dire need, and they were very grateful. However, I do not agree with the notion that the democratic party is making people to be dependent, eg, welfare; this is because I know that there are programs put in place that encourage people to come out of welfare and to work, and that only those who actually need welfare should be considered. The government at times create programs that would benefit the poor in order to try to fill the big gaps between the rich, and the poor.  There must be some sort of government intervention in this society, otherwise things would go terribly wrong. The Senior Citizens who had spent all their active years working and giving to society should expect something back from their government in their old age.  I do not see anything wrong in Senior Citizens voting for a party that promises to take care of them.

===message:Mr. Jones,  I made the statement that I was not a fan of FDR. It is not really him that I don't like, it is because some democrats today have really gone overboard offering assistance to supposedly down and out people.  I should have said that I don't approve of the beliefs and platforms of some of today's democrats that built their foundation on some of FDR's ideas. FDR was good for the country during the depression and was extremely influential
during his time.  I guess I just don't like the fact that many Americans took advantage of his ideas and it seems that it has become out of control.  For example:  Look at all the welfare frauds America has.  I have been witness to some of these frauds myself.  In the teaching profession, I see students receiving free lunch everyday, but come to school well-clothed, carrying extra money in their pockets for ice-cream, and their parents drop them off in very expensive vehicles.  I am afraid that this behavior will eventually hurt our economy.  You made some excellent points Mr. Jones.
