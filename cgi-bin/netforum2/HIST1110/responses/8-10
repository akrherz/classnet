===message:You are right on point. If Stalin or his people  even caught someone listening to music then they were considered to be idolizers of the west and would be sent to trial. Jazz music was considered to be evil, along with any other American things. The US's propaganda brought fear the the American families. I think you summed up everything nicely.

===message:I believe what you said was accurate; however let's not forget to mention that the countries poisoned the citizens into believing that the other was out to destroy the other one.  A lot of misleading of the truth was present.  A lot of people did not understand the meaning of Communism; they just believed the propaganda that their governments published.  I agree with your statement, just wanted to add a few more comments to you.

===message:That is a valid point.  Most citizens even today haven't the faintest clue about the ideals of Communism.  The propaganda plays more significantly on the minds of the ignorant.  I think the lack of Soviet education proved to be one of the best attributes to a successful propaganda campaign.  Not to say that Americans were innocent, as thier ignorance may have rivaled the general Soviet Public.

===message:Thank you all for your replies.  You all have stated valid points, but don’t forget that U.S. was also harassing former communist in their countries.  The government did even bother check to see if these individuals were practicing communism in the U.S.  No, we didn’t go to the extreme by creating a wall around U.S. but was still guilty of ruining those individual lives.  As for Soviets envying Americans, I believe that they envied the freedom that Americans had.  Americans were able to travel, listen to music, and just enjoy their lives.  Americans had no problem with the government as long as they didn’t acknowledge communism.  And the same went for the Soviets.

===message:Well I agree with you. both governments caused this fear among our people. But I do believe this, The U.S. is power hungry and so is the Soviet Union. You can see this by how both countries tried to influnce other countries.

===message:Not only did the Soviets portray Americans as being power hungry and wanting to destroy communism, I believe their biggest fear was the United States taking over Europe.  The Soviets were also power hungry in that aspect because they wanted control over Europe.  So in order to make the Soviet people agree that Americans were evil, they decided to "persuade" the minds of the people by adding in that the United States wanted to destroy communism.  If these people would have thought about it just a little harder, they might ask "why would the United States intentionally destroy the communist government when they were just recent allies together in World War II?"
