===message:The 1950s' was a time of great prosperity not only in America but in most parts of the world too. People would give different accounts of the BOOM though depending on whom you ask. I know that the narrators would be more diverse in this era if they were to do that segment again. This is because things are much more better now, and many more have gone out of the poverty line to the good life.
