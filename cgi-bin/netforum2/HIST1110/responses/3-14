===message:I agree most people were stunned at the duration and casualties of World War I.  However, I don't think many people received counseling during those times simply because there weren't as many resources for doing so as there are today.  I am sure many civilians and soldiers, especially in Europe, were motivated more so to ensure they had the necessities of life every day instead.

===message:You are right that the people were in a state of shock.  They had no clue what they were about to embark on.  If they could have looked into the future and see the devastation and destruction this war was about to cause, I’m sure they would have not let it happen.  Unfortunately, back then it wasn’t popular to get counseling and this type of help was not really offered on a large scale like it is today.  People were expected to “get over it” and move on because showing weakness was unpopular.

===message:Before WWI people were against war.  After the war their feelings about war remained the same.  Most countries that didn't want anything to do with the war had already created an alliance and had to enter on the side of their allies.  With the backing of different countries they found themeselves to be unstoppable.  Little did they realize the advancement of new weapons would be so destructive.  Young men that had their lives ahead of them soon became soldiers.  Against many of their wills, they were drafted.  They had to go from working at home to digging trenches and resort to killing people with weapons.  Civilians had to worry about their loved ones and had to work to fund the war.  They also experienced famine once trade was cut off.  Military leaders and political leaders all wanted the same payoff in the end: to be a dominant world power. They didn't know the war would go on as long as it did and didn't know how many lives would be lost.  People coped with their feelings about war through religion.  Some people believed that this war was the end of all world wars and that they wouldn't have to endure the same destruction.

===message:I believe that a "state of shock" is a mild way of putting how the emotions were of the people after World War I, but how do you put into words what their emotions were.  I don't believe that counseling was a big help in the early 1900's.  I believe that this is a "new" treatment that has recently evolved.  I think that people coped with their loses through faith, hope, and families.  Some people probably never coped with it.  I definetly agree that those opposed to the war paid closer attention to the government's decisions, but I believe that people who were for the war also tuned into the government actions with a closer eye.  This was not the war that ended all wars, but I believe that this was a "eye-opening" war.
