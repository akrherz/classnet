===message:Wars, famine, and hunger can not simply be eliminated because of a few technological inventions.  Wars exist because of the continuing globalization of the world.  One country competes with another so they do not over throw the others power.  Take WWII for example, without other countries involvement in Germany’s affairs, Hitler would have became the supreme ruler of Europe, like he intended.  Communism could have spread around the world and where would our rights be now?  We would not have any rights.  Famine (meaning hunger) will always be a concern in our world because of the constant population growth.  Countries that have poor sanitization, crowed cities, and no education (Africa for example) can not and do not know how to evolve into a better society.  We do have organizations that help the less fortunate nations, The CARE organization and Missionaries are two examples, but to eliminate hunger world wide is impossible.  And even in our Nation, it is our of the government’s hands to eliminate famine.  When families can not take care of the kids they already have, what gives them the right to have more and keep the poverty rate on a rise?  It is not our country that has the power to eliminate these concerns, it is the people themselves.

===message:   In countries like Africa, people are starving not only for lack of technology, funds, and education, but for political reasons as well. Did you know that missionaries in Zimbabwe, Africa are starving too? They have money, but the shelves in the grocery stores are empty. Missionary women from Africa report that they travel miles and miles to several different stores in order to buy the essentials- bread, milk, etc. Sure, a lot of the shortage is the product of a shortage of food, but the Zimbabwean government has been known to withold food from its people and use this precious commodity as a way to get support. This was one of the many strategies used in the presidential elections last March.

===message:Ken, I agree, but I do think that the many world governments should try to help to improve poverty in their own countries. Many of these countries have the ability to create jobs for their people. For example in the 1930's many countries were able to create jobs for the people who were living in poverty by creating a task force to brainstorm on how they could create jobs in their countries. But nowdays some of these governments are so focus on silly politics and enjoying their own wealth, that they choose not to pay attention to the poor in their countries.

===message:Thank you Mark...well said...Governments alone can not reduce poverty or famine, it also takes the individual to get up and get a job...make money for themselves instead of being lazy and depending on the Government for food and support.
