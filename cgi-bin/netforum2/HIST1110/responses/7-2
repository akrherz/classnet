===message:Veronica,  I totally agree with you!  How can an American hate what Hitler promoted and yet still turn around and act like him by teaching prejudism to his or her children against any minority just because they don’t look alike or come from the same country or religious background.  This is wrong.  God created a variety of peoples so life would be interesting and beautiful.  Instead of hating one another we should promote peace and harmony in all areas of life especially our own.

===message:I understand and sympathize with your feelings Veronica. However, I am offended by your comment that “Americans wanted to create their own Master Race.” In 1688 there were only a handful of slaves in the American colonies. By the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 there were about four million slaves, all of them concentrated in the southern states. Therefore, it was the ignorant, backward, white southerners that enslaved the blacks, not Americans. This plantation slavery soon led to fervent protests, and in the end it could not be resolved by peaceful means. Finally, after the terrible Civil War, the exhausted South gave in. Although there is no justification; the ignorant white southerner was not attempting to create a “Master Race” through slavery. Hitler and his reign of terror were very different from true Americans. Slavery, of both whites and blacks, was, of course, immemorially old when the southern states practiced it. Apparently, it had not always existed, but sooner or later every highly organized human society adopted it, because it seemed there was no other way to get the hard, unpleasant work done that societies needed. After Aristotle’s famous justification of slavery and his doctrine of “natural” slaves, it was easier to accept that necessity, and so slavery flourished almost everywhere on earth. Unfortunately, small pockets of slavery or pseudo-slavery survive in a few Third World countries. Hereditary debt servitude, for example, is a type of de facto slavery that has proved hard to eradicate in many nations. Fortunately, no nation that accepts slavery may enter the United Nations. The world as a whole refuses to accept the institution of slavery as legal. After something like five thousand years, one of the most monstrous affronts to justice has been eradicated from human thinking. I think the legal abolition of slavery was the nineteenth century’s greatest achievement. And it befitted the enormity of the institution that its destruction had to be accomplished by the cruelest and bloodiest war ever fought in North America. All of us, therefore, not just slaves and their descendants, owe much to the brave men who fought to abolish slavery. You should be proud to be an American and to live in this great country. I damn sure am!

===message:Doug, I am glad you understand and sympathize with my feeling. However, I do apologize to you or anyone that I may offend with my comment. Therefore, let me try to explain why American tried to create a Master Race.
Yes, you are correct on how you expressed your views and again slavery was abolished, but people of color were still discriminated against before NAACP, Civil Rights Acts, and Brown vs. board of education became effective. Minorities were required to attend separate schools, were barred from competing with white Americans for good employment, rights to vote, uses of separate public services and facilities(for instance, transportation, recreation, restrooms, drinking fountains) and frequently had no access at all to privated facilities such as hotels, restaurants, and theaters. Many were lynched or severely, beaten by members of the Ku Klux Klan and other extremist associations. Similar though generally less virulent discriminatory practices were carried out against Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and other minority groups. Only a few selected white minorities tried to help before Dr. Martin Luther Kings, Jr. and other civil rights leaders emerged to challenge deep seated patterns of racial discrimination. Fierce opposition to civil right demonstrations made the head lines in the late 1950s and early 1960s as dogs and fire hoses were used to disperse demonstrators. Is this the way we suppose to treat our fellow man if we supposed to be equal? No. After three civil rights worker were murdered in Mississippi, the U.S. Congress passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and other legislation that attempted to guarantee equal protection of the laws for all minority citizens.
Hilter was no different from the Ku Klux Klan or other extremist that discriminates against people.
Therefore, as I have said before, we must love one another in this world to have peace there is no such things as a Master Race. No man has the power to create a Master Race; only God has that power and if he wanted one he would have create one. Discrimination is ugly and evil and if we have this in our heart, we need to pray to get rid of it. We as people are all equal in God eyes because he created us all and not one Master Race. 
As for me being proud to be an American and living in this country, I am proud. I do not discriminate regardless of orientation, race, religion, or creed. I am a true American.

===message:Excellent response Veronica. Racism is one of the most serious diseases of the human species. It is a curious fact that no other species of animal appears to suffer anything like it. Until the twentieth century it was taken for granted by almost everyone that the human race was not one single community of like and equal souls, but a crowd of better and worse, superior and inferior, chosen and damned. There were many ways to express this concept. Perhaps they all came down to the notion, first promulgated by Aristotle, that some human beings are born to rule and others to serve. Regrettably, this notion was still active in the South not too long ago as you so eloquently stated. Although this type of thinking is dying out in our modern world, we must not be complacent. Racism is not eradicated when people cease to believe in the natural inferiority of others. It is still possible to hate them, even if it is conceded that they are more or less equal as human beings. If anything, racial hatred seems to be increasing rather than decreasing in the world today, for some unknown reason. We may never rid ourselves of racial hatreds; yet, the advance we have made should never be forgotten.

===message:Doug, I'm glad you and I have come to an equally conclusion on the subject and I agree with your statement. Racial hatred does seems to be increasing rather than decreasing in the world today, for some unknown reason, that's why we as individuals must distant ourselves from people who shares these negative views. As Americans, we must always look forward to a better world than step back to the negative world in the past.

===message:Hi Veronica, I totally agree with your statement.  The only difference between Hitler and the KKK was that Hitler let it be known in public how he felt about the Jews, African Americans, homosexuals, etc.  The KKK had to hide underneath white sheets to show their hatred.  And those who were not part of the KKK were just as bad because they segregated everything.  And just like you said, "...love one another...to have peace."

===message:Do you think that back in the early 1900's people were trying to treat each others as equals?  I don't.  Equality may have been getting started, but during that era, I feel that equality didn't exist.  Hitler was an evil man and he made it known that he didn't like Jews, African Americans, or anyone else that wasn't blond-haired or blue-eyed.  In my opinion(not to offend anyone), most Americans came from Europe.  So, the so called "Americans" weren't too different from Hitler.  Now I am not saying that all Americans are like Hitler, only the ones that housed the same kind of hatred like he did.  Many white Americans thought they reigned supreme and thought it was okay to "own" black people.  So to me, I consider the people that felt that way thought just like Hitler.  They thought they were a master race within themselves and everyone that didn't look like them weren't as good as them. They were responsible for the enslaving of African Americans as well as the killing of Native Americans.  These new "Americans" weren't any better than Hitler.
