===message:Eric, I appreciate your father’s illustration about the competitive nature of the USSR and the USA.  No competitive game is good if it incites negative feelings such as hatred and superiority over another.  Rather than have world leaders think up propaganda (or gossip) about another country, I believe that they should educate the public in the real unbiased facts and let the public decide what is right and wrong.  When a person is tried in a court of law, a group of his/her peers listen to all the hard evidence (the facts) before rendering a decision.  I believe this is the best way to make an educated decision about a person or a country.  Critical Thinking is a required class here that teaches you how to better discern between fact, fiction, or a person’s opinion.  Before taking the class, I was at a loss as to why it was required, now I understand how it benefits us.

===message:I agree - so much is spinned to hide the truth especially by a leadership that thinks people cannot deal with honesty.  That is why the loss of Senator Wellstone will be felt.  He provided a high degree of integrity in DC as recognized by both sides of the aisle including ultra conservatives who respected him for telling it as he saw it as a liberal and proud of it.  However, many politicans learned from the 1984 election. Democratic candidate Mondale stated he would raise taxes; President Reagan said no way.  People did not want to hear Mondale's message though taxes were raised just after the election.

===message:Wendy, this raises a valid question.  In reponse to your statement that the facts should be presented in an unbiased manner and let the pubnlic decided which is right of wrong.  Perhaps they should, but in doing so propaganda would not be serving its purpose.  The goal of propaganda is to distort the facts into a manner that ingratiates the government.  Leaders such as Hitler, Stalin, and yes Eisenhower and Rooosevelt utilize propaganda as a means of providing optimism in its government while demonizing the opposition.

===message:Is that not what frequently happens during political discussions?  Multiple sides place their spin to further their positions whether it is by omission or distortion.  I'm looking forward to the debate on social security because neither side has mentioned how to pay the current recipients or the impact on balancing the budget while investments occur that remove money from the central pot used for present day pay outs.

===message:Well, seeing how the Soviet people lived was propaganda on it's own. Many Americans saw how this side lived and feared that there lives would be like that if the Soviet dominanted the world. But, the U.S. also feed its citizens some lies about the Soviets.
