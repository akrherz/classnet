===message:It was a growing experience for many and I do believe that boys came back "war-torn men." I think that in a way the world's nations especially and even the whole world for that matter did the same.  I feel like part of this war for the U.S. came from a lack of international war. We had fought civil wars here and there but had yet to engage in a world battle that would serve as a benchmark for national success.  It's like branching off from a professional ball team and starting your own team but coming to a point to where you've played as many games amonst your own team as you possible can and deeply need to play another team. At that point a shot at the series isn't even what you would be looking for.  We needed fulfillment as a nation.  To feel like we were world renown.  We had been a around for a while and having broken free from other countries and outer controls it was high time for a war of our own.  This hunger for war and a show of power exemplifies an animal nature so much that it seems almost like a game you would see animals play on a GPTV special on adolescent apes or something.  I believe that we learned a lot but mostly it was just the fact that we got that first big world premier out of the way.  We wised up a good bit and changed our prespective of war and the intensity thereof however we're still a nation that's growing up even now and has many like trials to tackle in the future as well.
