===message:I agree with your assessment that the video concentrated on whites especially the growing middle class, and ignored the plights of minorities and poor whites.  Your inclusion of the homeless is interesting because in the 1950s this group was hidden in specific rundown sections of the bigger cities like the Bowery in NYC.  The homeless becomes visible seemingly everywhere during the 1980s.

===message:If you think about it, most of the TV shows and Movies about the 50's depicted white america. I think one of the best TV shows that probably everyone knows of course would be Happy Days. I can't even remember seeing any African-Americans in that show at all. It was not until the 70's that shows such as Good Times started coming out depicting African American life in the US. These shows make it seem that life was good for everyone though.

===message:I appreciate and agree with all of your responses.  The program only showed those who benefited from the boom industry.  Yes, there were a lot jobs but they weren’t for everyone.  Therefore, it was impossible for them to enjoy prosperity during 50s.  And of course they didn’t want to show that homeless existed because the U.S. would look bad in the eyes of the weaker countries that they are trying to influence.  U.S. should have never had any homeless people period, but yet we were able to give $13 billion Marshall Plan to aide foreign countries.  And to top it off, U.S. main reason was to stop the spread of communism in the European countries.

===message:Often jobs and the unemployed are not in the same proximity.  This split began during the 1950s boom time as companies began to leave the northeastern inner cities.  The welfare to work law passed under Clinton may force people to find jobs, but an adult raising a child may find flipping burgers as the only available employment.  Transportation to jobs remains a problem.  Also there are health care, child care, and education issues not easily resolved.

===message:The 50's were more concentrated on success not the unsuccessful people of the time.  The segment is about boom time.  Why would this segment go into homelessness and the people that were not booming from the economy with the name "Boom Time"?

===message:I agree that the episode did not depict everyone.  I disagree that it disincluded "basically anyone non-white."  The episode did not depict the lower class people, the unemployed, senior citizens, farmers, or non-white people.  The only "prosperous Americans" shown were those of the upper middle class family.  To say that most whites were fortunate is incorrect.  Heck, I am white and I sure wouldn't have be shown on this video for my materialistic achievements. :)
