===message:Keri, I agree with you when you say athletes are more interested in their paychecks than in the game.  I believe that sports should not be about winning or losing but rather it should be about having fun and enjoying youself.  Sports should be a stress relieving activity but today there is so much emphasis on winning the game that instead it adds more stress rather than reliving stress.  This is something we definitely don’t need since we get all the stress we can handle (and can’t handle) at work, home, and school.
