===message:Jump back on that box man!   For years our very country did not want to become an international police and the fact that we have should not disable us from stopping terrorist and taking care of buisness in other countries.  The fact that we should have to ask for permission to attack another country when we are basically protecting everyone else as well is absurd. Our President should be able to pursue his current actions as planned.  Everyone rallied around him last year.  But has it really been that long ago that we should forget how devestatingly someone can hurt our country?

===message:I have to agree with you all.  When I hear people saying that we have no right or should not be involved in other countries problems it makes me mad.  The only reason that we have been involved in other countries is to help the people that are unable to help themselves because of the government of current situation in their country.  As in the Gulf War we were asked by Saudi Arabia to come and help them protect themselves from a possible invasion.

===message:Yes , Robert it does seem that we have somehow been thrown into the position of being the peace police in this world , and as you have pointed out  the so called neutral spectators  do nothing but criticize all our efforts.  Maybe those spectators  secretly wish we will fail. I agree wholeheartedly with your statement stating that , “the preservation of our constitution and freedom are worth fighting a war for”, because a lot of people have given their lives already so that we can enjoy the freedom that we have in our country.
