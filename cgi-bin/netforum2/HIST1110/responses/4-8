===message:Janna, I agree with you that the mass of people that make up a nation really are not asked their input before the leaders go to war.  In fact, many times they don’t even have a clear understanding of why they are going to war.  I noticed this in the soldiers’ responses in “All Quiet on the Western Front.”  Do you think these political leaders see the people of their nation as an impressionable mass of people they can deceive and manipulate to their advantage?

===message:Thanks for your response Wendy.  To answer your question, political leaders often times make decisions based on the idea that since they are the leader of their nation/country then they are better able to come to a solution for their people.  This may not necessarily mean that the leader's goal is to manipulate their countrymen.  They know the political and economic climate and feel they are able to make a better decision as a result. In other words, these leaders may feel they know what's best for their nation under the circumstances.

===message:Janna, I think you are right on almost all of your statements except for when war is declared, the average person does not have any input at all, anytime, for any war.  Only the few people representing us.  And we may or may not agree with their decisions.  You said, "There is no formula for ending or preventing all wars, it is simply a fact of life which has been occuring since the beginning of mankind."  My belief is that...no there is no sure way of preventing wars, but, as for ending them, when we blow each other to pieces we will be speaking of "The beginning of mankind," we will be ending mankind.

===message:I agree with your comment about some of the causes of war are supremacy, greed, and defense. Leaders want their nation to be the greater power and do try to gain territory.  Then security becomes an issue, and that is where defense comes in.  I am not quite sure I agree with your comment about wars being declared without the input of the nation.  I think in most situations, people are very well aware of the moments leading up to war, as well as when the war itself is declared.  I am sure that pacifism does play a part before war actually takes place, but input of the people isn't really going to be able to stop a war, when it's already been in the making.  The people generally follow the leader and the leader represents the nation as a whole, so I guess in a way, their voices are heard.

===message:Janna, I agree with your ideas of how wars are created.  I also believe there are many more reasons wars begin such as religious and ethical beliefs, for people (countries) to "suck up" to other nations, and even boredom.  I was in the military for 4 years, and the soldiers of today are very aware of what they are getting into when they go into war.  There are several briefings and meetings to inform the men and women of the circumstances of war and what to be prepared for.  When World War I occured, this was obviously not the technique that is used today.  The soldiers may not have a choice about wether they want to go to war, but they knew that was a possibilty when they enlisted.  Alot of the men of WWI did not have a choice because of the draft.  Hopefully today's military will be sufficient enough that there will not have to be another draft put into effect.
