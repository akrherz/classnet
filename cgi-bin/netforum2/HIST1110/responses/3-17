===message:You make a good point regarding the “romantic idea” of WW1 Wendy. World War One was fought by young men who believed in a just cause, yet who were naïve in their view of life. They went to war thinking they would fight a romantic war, only to find themselves in mud and death which they could not stop, in a war controlled by senior officers brought up on unrealistic tactical methods and with no realistic alternatives. In the end the politics of this war were insignificant compared to the feelings, fear, and experience of the individual men and what they thought of this appalling, pointless, and inhuman tragedy.

===message:As I read your paragraph, I agreed with many of the points you made.  You would think with all the horrors of World War I, that nations, governments, and it's citizens would have done everything possible to prevent another war of that magnitude from occuring ever again.  The League of Nations was a move in the right direction for these countries after the war.

===message:It is true that people did not know what the effects of this war was going to be until they went into it, and realized it was very devastating on both sides.  Russian soldiers couldn't cope with the demands of war and they deserted.  Society had faced a lot of hardship; felt that this type of war shouldn't have taken place, and just like you said, the League of Nations was born inorder to prevent another one from occuring.

===message:I think the fact that people were so proud to be a citizen of whichever country that they came from and the strong sense of duty to ones country was the reason that parents were proud of their sons who served in the war. The parents probably did know the risks that their child would be taking but there was really no way to prevent the government from calling on their young men to serve their country.
