===message:I absolutly agree with you.  People's views of war totally changed after World War I.  Wars before 1914 provided some sort of result.  This war, however, ended with no proved gain for anyone.  Soldiers went to war because "that was the thing to do" not because they were fighting for a cause.  You made a very good comment, and I agree with everything that you said.

===message:There should have been more restrictions on the peace treaty to prevent war in the future.  Wilson should have let Clemenceau place more of the issues that he wanted since France was so close to Germany and knew that something this horrific could happen again.

===message:When there is no clear gain from war, people will begin to view war as an unnecessary evil. If there is a clear motive and reason for war, then people are able to rally around its cause. WWI was unable to provide the clear positive results that were needed in order to justify the enormous loss of life. At this point, people that were for war will turn against it, and the people that were against war will have more “ammunition” to fight against future wars.
