===message:Melanie, I 100% agree with what you said. I think that athletes like these should not be considered admirable in any way. They continue to do things that are wrong because they know that they can get away with it. The saying "more money more power" is correct in this sense because they are able to buy themselves the best lawyers to defend them and also the judges are not as hard on them as they would be to someone with less money. Like you I do not want my brother to look up to people like this.

===message:I agree with you. Instead of looking up to these athletes parents need to teach their children about looking up to people who have accomplish great things in their communities such as doctors, policemen, preachers,etc. The media tends to glamorize athletes, singers, movie stars, etc. The media needs to start putting more focus on the heroes of this county.
