===message:Not only was there fear about destroying or spreading communism, there was a fear about who would control Europe.  Each country wanted to have power over this land as a way of showing their true "power."  Soviets wanted to have a communist Europe, while America wanted a capitalist Europe.  This shows the aspects of each country wanting dominance so that the other country would not achieve it.  I believe this was more of a "see what I have, and see what you don't have" situation.
