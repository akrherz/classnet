===message:Mr. Ehrlich, I am not really sure what you were trying to say in your first couple of sentences.  I don't agree with you that our superiority is not all due to our finances.  Americans do have a lot to be proud of and if there are some people that feel superior to people of other nations I figure that it is because they have worked hard to get where they are today.  I don't feel superior to anyone, however there are people in America that still feel that other races are inferior to them.  These feelings are called "prejudice".  Prejudice is a learned behavior  most likely past on from the parents to the children, etc.

===message:No need to shout Mr. Ehrlich by quotation marks, Ms. Whiteman is only explaining your statement on how you stated that, "Americans look down to these people(foreigners and illegal aliens) and expect them to do low graded jobs that Americans don't want to do." As I see it, some Americans are doing the same low graded jobs due to their lack of educational background and plus that is the only job that will hire them without a high school education, so that is a prejudice statement on how you only single out certain people. (sorry)

===message:My comments are in no way to be taken wrong or for people to think I am prejudice because I am multiracial and have many different nationalities in many family. I somewhat agree with what Mark said about foreigners and illegal aliens and the low graded jobs. There are many people who come here from other countries in search of a better life. For example I'll use the Mexicans who come to the United States. These people come here for a better life and so that their children can be well educated. They are proud, hard-working people who do not mind doing the "low graded" jobs that nobody else wants to do. And now this is a problem? Well people don;t think so when their houses are being built. And I saw on the news the other day where people were actually complaining because these Mexicans are doing the work! What's wrong with that picture? In this way I must agree with Mark but also I do not think that finances are the only reasones why Americans feel superior. And Mark don't take things so personally, doing that leads to confusion.

===message:Mr. Ehrlich you are absolutely correct.  The ideas are harmful to immigrants because they lose life and limb to get here, just to take dead-end, low-paying jobs.  The whole idea of financial classification is just downright poisonous.
