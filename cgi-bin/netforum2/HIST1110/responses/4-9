===message:In response to Kristin Crook:  I agree with your view on the reality of this world.  Pacifism, may never be fully attainable.  The world of global interrelatedness in a sort of "catch 22."  On on hand, we should seemingly be able to settle cultural and political differences because of improved and instant communication. On the other hand, the world is more suseptable to believe that they can convert people to their beliefs, causing more problems.  Most governments are no longer practicing isolationism as a foreign policy but instead (maybe worse) are trying to push their beliefs of religion and politics on other cultures.  People have come so far in realizing that the world is growing smaller, but they have hardly accomplished the idea that being different is ok.

===message:Keith I agree with you that diversity is not something that our world readily accepts. It seems that people will be people and even though the many governments of this world may not claim to be isolationists every country has its own ways and governments pride themselves in becoming the elite ones. As long as the selfish ambition of the state of sublimity exists and people continue to be blinded by their own ambitions to the suffering countries of the world, how can a peace among the nations exist. Pride and jealousy are the results of selfishness, and pride and jealousy have fueled countless wars and terrorist acts. In the words of the ragamuffin poet, Rich Mullins, “Why do the nations rage?”

===message:In your discussion you stated that you thought it was a good idea for our government to "go after Saddam Hussein in order to protect America from total destruction".  Their is a difference between going after a deranged dictator and declaring war on an entire country.  I say this from experience.  In 1989 the United States invaded a small country in central america called Panama.  The military dictator of this country was a man called Manuel Noriega.  Just like Saddam Hussein, their was a time when the United States had good relations with this man.  When Operation Just Cause came to Panama alot of innocent people were killed in the name of "freeing the Panamanian people".  The United States was able to remove him sucessfully and the invasion only lasted about 2 weeks.  Since this man was removed from power their has been democracy in Panama.  It did not come easily, but it came because the people wanted it.  You may be asking why am I writing all of this?  Kristin do you think all of the people of Iraq feel the same way Saddam Hussein does?  Do you think the Iraqi people want to destroy all americans?  Just like the United States came into Panama and removed Noriega, If the United States feels it is necessary, they could remove Saddam Hussein.  Yes some people died and their was a need for violence, but war was not declared on an entire nation.  If Saddam Hussein really had the capability and need to destroy America, why would our government have left him in power for so long?  Why didn't we remove him the last time we declared war on Iraq? Something to think about.

===message:I don't think it is so much pride as it is for land hunger.  The more land that you have to control the more power that you will have, is the main reason for wars.
