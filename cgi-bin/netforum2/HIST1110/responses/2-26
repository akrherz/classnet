===message:I agree with you, thank goodness I live  now rather that then.  If I lived in 1902 and my situation was the same, I would have a very bleak future.  If I lived in Lake Village Arkansas, which is in the delta, as a black female with a child at the age of 19 and unmarried, in the year of 1902, I would not be able to take advantage of telecourses like this to achieve a degree.  I can only think of my great-grandmother who was in the exact same position as a model.  She never left the delta, she worked until she died.  depended on what she could grow to eat, never had a chance to advance in the world because she was always behind.  Now 100 years later, I, her great-grandaughter, had the opportunity to apply for every grant and scholorship I could put my hands on to get funds so that I could go to school full time and still be able to provide a roof over mine and my daughters head.  Now, hard work does truly pay off, literally, and I can confidently say that my life couldn't be better that this 100 years ago.
