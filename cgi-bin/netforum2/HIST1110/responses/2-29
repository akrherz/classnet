===message:that is a perplexing question as I am asked to answer a question that is based on material that was included, but most importantly, material not included in our history books. today, we are blessed and cursed with the gift of technology. at the same time constantly keeping people in touch, items as the web are increasingly diminishing interpersonal skills and further alienating some. technology has definitely improved our lives but at the same time many cannot afford this wonderful tool. there are countries ravaged by disease and unless there is a financial interest, countries, mainly the US, will not offer assistance. life spans for humans have increased but not for everyone, minorities are disproportionately affected more than others with disease, stress, depression and premature death. minorities are still second class citizens and deal with the same problems that they dealt with one hundred years ago. 

One hundred years ago, disease ruled the planet. now medical advances have wiped out many diseases although one exists now that is by far the worst as it robs one of the joy of experiencing God's greatest gift and sends one to a slow, agonizing death. the workplace is by far much better today than it was one hundread years ago. air conditioning has made life livable in the south as i cannot imagine living without cold air in my place. one hundred years ago life was much simpler. so for me, is the world a better place now than one hundred years ago? it truly depends on who you are, where you are from and your financial situation.
