===message:Gena, I appreciate that you are trying to keep us informed on current events and that you wanted our opinions (responses).  I understand that everybody has a right to their opinion and this is mine.  The prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba are treated as any POW would be, according to the Geneva Convention.  They are fortunate that they have ten minutes for meals which are probably more nutritious than any other meal they have eaten.  I just don't believe these prisoners were beaten for calling each other to prayer.  I think that is just Islamic Propaganda.  As for the man with the wife and nine children, POWs are only entitled to the same pay that they would receive when in their own army.  And, in no case do we owe them an apology.  If the man has a wife and nine children, what was he doing in the Taliban army anyway?  We have nothing to be ashamed of and statements such as you have reported would only give aid and comfort to the enemy, and that is classified as treason.  The Afghani prisoners are in the same category of terrorists as the Palestinians who are busily terrorizing and murdering Israelies.  A very dear friend of mine was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam war.  He was in a tiny bamboo cage submerged in water with fecal matter up to his chin.  He was beaten every day and many days was given no food at all.  On the days he was allowed to have something to eat, it was just a tiny bowl of rice.  You can see why I have no pity for the way the United States is treating the terrorists.  I also have another friend who was a POW of the Germans during WWII.  His plane was shot down by the Germans and he was captured.  He was regularly beaten in the face and the private areas, was forced to march 600 miles through the snow, and was given nothing to eat.  His best buddy died in his arms doing this.  He also read your comments and was very surprised by your opinions.  Let's remember Desert Storm.  Are there any findings that the prisoners America captured were mistreated during this war?  No, they had excellent treatment.  They were anxious to surrender.  They knew they would be treated fairly and be fed on a regular basis.  I work at an elementary school and hardly get ten minutes to eat, as well.  Maybe since I work for the government, I am being mistreated, too.

===message:Hi Gena,
Your write up was well understood but I have a different opinion which I would like to share.  I do not totally blame the United States soldiers or guards at Guantanamo bay for doing their job.  Do you know that some of those detainees have publicly said that they would kill any U S soldier if they had the chance?  You should understand that these guards are working with the “enemy” who mostly believe in Jihad, and do not care if they die in the process of killing U S personnel.  Take it that these prison guards are sheep living among wolves that would devour them at any given opportunity; hence they have to take measures to protect themselves.  Here in the United States, prisoners take about 10 or 15 minutes to eat their meals and go back to work.  They don’t leave in apartment buildings while in prison;the prisons here are actually overcrowded.   I think those detainees at Guantanamo bay are being treated well under the circumstances.  Yes, they have to be housed in such a way they can be contained.  It is also appropriate not to relax with a group of people who kill just because their master said so or because their religion says so.   The United States soldiers are more tamed than most soldiers around the world, and I believe they are working according to specifications.  We are at war for God sake, and believe me whether in prison or released, they continue to threaten harm against the United States; and you think we have to treat them like kings?  If Americans were the prisoners, they would have been tortured and would not live to tell the story.

===message:I totally understand that this is war. I also understand that if any of our soldiers are captured they would be treated 10 times worse, and you are right would not live to tell about it. I am not defending anyone. I am just saying that does it make it right for us to treat people that way when we are supposed to be the country that runs in to help everyone. We are always getting envolved in things in other countries, proclaiming it is for humanitarian reasons. We are like this country on a pedistal, everyone watches us and expects us to do nothing but good. I am in no way saying we owe them an apology, I guess I was trying to point out that we to treat people badly under certain circumstances, whatever they may be. I was just trying to relate this to what we read about war and the way others where treated during those times. I in no way support anything or anyone that has anything to do with terrism on any front. I am sorry you all took it that way. I just wanted to point out that sometimes even the US does things that are looked upon as not favorable.

===message:Gena, I understand where both you and those who responded to are coming from. I can respect that everybody is entitled to their opinion. I am also glad you were brave enough to bring the topic to the discussion board. In the directions for our discussions, Dr. Rosenburg makes it clear that he wants us to feel free to speak our mind, even though we think it may not necessarily be right or the most popular opinion. I have to say that my mushy, caring side was apalled when I first read your posting, but also once I thought about it and discussed it with my husband, I too feel like even though the treatment of prisoners was harsh, we must remember what is going on in the world and that because of unfortunate circumstances, our military has to be tough. I don't think its a long shot to say that the danger at times is probably worse than we could ever think. I agree that American soldiers can be a bit cocky about the whole defense thing, but I also agree that its people like them that protect our country and are able to do with such fervor because they do love America and are willing to get tough with the terrorists in order to protect our land of security and freedom. After thinking it through, that's my conclusion; I am wondering if your opinion has changed any throughout this part of this discussion?

===message:Gena,  I agree with you that no one should be treated inhumanly even if they are wicked and would do to you things twice as bad as you would do to them.  I’m from the old school, and I’m not afraid to voice my belief.  I believe in the principles of the Bible and Jesus’ teachings.  He said when your enemy slaps you on the right cheek you should turn your other cheek to him also, and never to return evil for evil.  Jesus never resorted to violence even when he was tortured to death by his enemies.  I’m sure there are other ways the United States could get vital information out of the POWs that wouldn’t reflect the same cruelty that terrorists would subject their prisoners to.  Really, why should we lower ourselves to their level?  If we are better than them, than I think we need to act like it.  Yes, it’s important to bring to justice the criminals who have slaughtered innocent lives, but why not bring them to proper justice in a court of law?

===message:You know there are all kinds of unjust going on in this world. What they did to us Sept 11th was just a small part of it. The fact that it hit home, on our land, somewhere that we felt invulnerable is what has everyone shaken. We haven’t been attacked on our soil like that since Pearl Harbor. I mean think back in history. We persecuted the Indians taking their land from them. Then we persecute Africans and make them slaves, and make them build this country. Then later we persecute African-Americans. Hitler persecuted the Jews. It goes on and on. I guess the humane side of me got upset when I saw the news. No matter what country it is or who is the prisoner and the jailor it is inhumane, but that is the life and times we live in now.

===message:The treatment may seem harsh, but from what I have read on international military law, it is a legitimate treatment of prisoners of war.  Unless something has changed, the incarcerated people in Cuba are all enemy soldiers taken from the Afghan war zone.  I find more horrendous is the several hundred folks, who were arrested and hidden away from view under the pretense of security by the Attorney General.  The only reason we know some names is because loved ones have spoken to the media.  Many remain nameless after a year and the government has not shown any indication of illegal actions.  Many others have minor immigration violations acknowledge by Ashcroft, but apparently no known ties to the terrorists.  Almost anyone can be grabbed under the pretense of security so maybe I better not send this response as I would rather pay my own way for 3 square and board.

===message:Since we are off the instructor topic, I like to express my opinion. There are alot of things people of Americans and non-Americans shouldn't do but when it comes to protecting our country, I don't care what the military would do to insure my safety as well as others in this world. But look at the facts: Do you think it was fair how they torture, beaten, and starve our American POWs of the Vietnam war, which some soldier are still missing today? Do you think it's fair how the Uniited States is treating John Walker, since he went against his American country to join terrorist? I have no pity for the way the United States is treating the terrorists. I just waiting on them to get their hands on "Bin Laden" and all his terrorists groups.

===message:Gena, I am in a way torn between what you and the responders said. But when I really start to think about the whole issue I feel that those terrorists are getting their just dues. Bin Ladin and his group of terrorists attcked and killed many many people on Sept. 11, who were innocent and in no way trying to attack and bring harm to the Middle East. They were just doing their job, instead of getting a days pay they got death. A few weeks ago I heard that Bin Ladin has made a tape stating that the US should beware of another attack and degrading our country and our lifestlye. So it's not like he has changed. He will stop at nothing to see the US go down, and it's so sad because he has alot of followers who believe in the same thing he believes in. They have not shown nor have any feelings of remorse and sympathy for what they did. They treat our POWs the same way and probably worse. I feel like we should do whatever it takes to capture Bin Ladin and if not all then the majority of the terrorist, before more incidents like Sept. 11 happen again and with them roaming free it could and is likely. I am not saying we have to kill him (though I would not be upset if we did) but I do think he needs to be caught and severe concequences should be brought against him. If it is between my loved ones and I or him, I say get him before he gets us. I appricate you posting this on the discussion page because it does give everyone something to think about and I do think that you made some good points in your discussion as well.

===message:I have been debating on whether or not to weigh-in on this topic since it was first posted. The prisoners in Guantanamo Bay are being held in a time of war -plain and simple. Have we all forgotten who we’re fighting here? Maybe we should book them all rooms at the Marriot with room service. And while we are at it, lets make sure they are on the right side of the hotel to be facing Mecca. But I digress..Though this topic is somewhat off the subject, it does relate to the reality of media propaganda. As is in this and all cases, we must first consider the source of this information. ABC is widely known as a media company with a left-wing bias. Thus, it is not surprising to see documentary pieces on this network that undermine Bush-Administration actions. Furthermore, Peter Jennings is a Native-Canadian and is outspoken on his disdain for the current U.S. Republican policy. See, the idea here is to exploit the viewer by force-feeding the audience with unsubstantiated claims that those in power are inept and acting outside the boundaries of American morals. This is a clear example of how effective propaganda is. The sad part, is John Q. Public knows no better than to accept what left-wing ABC reports as gospel. This may sound to some as a paranoid viewpoint and conspiracy theory but it is as real as apple pie. Propaganda is on our television every night at six o’clock. As for me, I will rely on a much more reliable source for my information than Peter Jennings and his cronies. Note: I am afraid I cannot respond to the statement that "we are no better than Hitler when he persecuted the Jews". I was utterly speechless after reading that and was so overwhelmed with disbelief, I could not construct a responce without risking heart-failure in the process.

===message:You all have valid opinions and I thank you all for your responses.  I must admit, I’m not into political affairs but we’re not being inhumane.  The same thing that’s going on in our prison camps is also happening at the terrorist camps too, if not worse.  Today’s war is totally different from the others.  We are dealing with men, women, and children who will do whatever it takes to support their leader.  You have women with bombs attached to their bodies bombing buses filled with other women and children.  You're right, two wrongs don’t make a right but it’s about seeing reality for what it is and trying to overcome the catastrophe brought to U.S.

===message:I have no sympathy for these prisoners. If it were our soldiers that were captured, they would be tortured or just killed. We have seen this in the past. If a citizen is willing to fight for their country, then they should be willing to face the consequences if they are captured. They certainly should not be offered compensation. All of these prisoners were fighting for a group that killed thousands of innocent Americans without any regret. Why should we take great efforts to make them comfortable and treat them fairly. I am not saying they should be tortured, necessarily, however, they should be treated like the animals they are.

===message:I think that if you don't show the people in support of terrorism that the United States is serious, then there would be more attacks on Americans.  This is not inhumane treatment.  This is a case of individuals who were caught trying to destroy Americans.  Now they are captive, and we should treat them humanely?  I don't think that even sounds right.  If you are willing to risk your life to destroy others, then you run the risk of becoming a POW and no "humane" treatment is deserved.
