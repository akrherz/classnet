===message:I agree with your comment about Roosevelt being the right man at the right time.  If not him, then who else?  He was the president, the man the people elected and he had a duty to help the American people and the economy.  He restored the faith in government leaders, and he came up with several programs to get the country back on track.  He was definitely what the country needed at the time.
