===subject:Boycott Sports!
===message:Traditionally, sports had been seen to represent ideals of physical excellence, team working harmony, and the concept of sportsmanship. By the 1920’s spectator sports had moved to the center of American consciousness. The golden age of sports was part of the flowering of the entertainment business, the growth of a leisure-oriented consumer ethic, and the rise of the cult of celebrity. Like movie stars, athletes became celebrities whose faces appeared in countless advertisements and whose salaries were reported in the press and marveled at by adoring fans. Individuals such as Babe Ruth, Joe Louis, Red Grange, and Jack Dempsey were the most celebrated in a pantheon of heroes whose public lives exemplified glamour, fame, and the good life. Unfortunately, with the increasing commercialization of sports, these values are eroding. Sports have become big business and the players have benefited from this state of affairs with their salaries rivaling those of chief executive officers of large corporations. In today’s society, people are often more disgusted with athletes and their arrogant, greedy and selfish attitudes, and “bad-boy” antics. And the media, with its need to create entertainment, has had a great impact on this situation by overemphasizing these factors. The American public should painfully educate both the greedy owners and arrogant players by boycotting sports all together.

===message:People admired Joe Lewis and Babe Ruth because they were excellent athletes and people who liked sports considered them to be the best in their fields at that point and time.  Joe Lewis was admired by both black and white people for at that time it was unusual for a black man to have the opportunity to excell in his field and become as popular as Joe Lewis did.  I really don't think that most people at that time, (even though African Americans did not have the rights that they do now) he was just darn good at what he did.  He still admired and revered for the kind of athlete that he was.  Athletes such as Babe and Joe brought a large number of Americans together.  Folks could enjoy themselves, have something and someone to look up to and could take their minds off of the depression and wars to some extent.  It was America's favorite past time.  Many sports fans today, adult and child, admire athletes such as Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neil.  Unfortunately, there aren't too many athletes that people find admirable today because of their undesirable life styles.  These two people mentioned above do not seem to be living a degenerate lifestyle like so many of the other over paid athletes.  I am not that big of a sports fan but of the pick these two have excelled in area sports and movies as well.  As far as I know these athletes are very admirable to many.  At least you don't here about them doing anything illegal such as drugs or rape like Mike Tyson.  Unfortunately, my feelings about Mike Tyson and most of the other over paid, self-indulgent, think they are above the law athletes should not even be allowed to even be in the sports arena.  Even our own Atlanta Braves have refused to give children autographs without pay according to the newspaper and television.

===message:In the early 1900s, the United States had more leisure time than at any time before.  Consequently, many people were hungry for thrills and entrepreneurs were all too willing to oblige them.  At this point such famous athletes as Joe Louis and Babe Ruth became popular.  Joe Louis represented the “good guys” (America) against the “bad guys” (Germany).  Therefore, he represented the American way-of-life and was supported and admired by the American people (which transcended all racial barriers).  Babe Ruth was shown to have so many things against him such as being an orphan, a drinker, and a glutton.  People could relate to his imperfections as he was considered to be “a man of the people.”  He proved that even with all his misgivings, he could still succeed and win the game without turning into a saint.  Today, people see success by how popular, powerful, and rich you are, and this is what they admire in today’s athletes (like Mike Tyson, etc).  Unfortunately, these traits are not what I call “admirable.”  Rather, I esteem people who are peaceful, loving, kind, loyal, and honest.  Sadly, these qualities seem to be in short supply today.

===message:The American people admired Joe Louis and Babe Ruth because they were representing U.S.  Both men symbolized the amount of power and strength that U.S. was lacking after the war.  Ruth and Louis made the Americans people feel proud of being Americans.  They also helped the people not focus on the tragedies of the war.  Louis’s victory showed that the Germans could be defeated by a non-superior race.  I would have to say that Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Serena & Venus Williams, and many more athletes are definitely admired by everyone worldwide today. The some of the things that people admire about these athletes is their determination, motivation, and business savvy.  They are definitely admirable because outside of their fame, they are still human beings who also have personal lives with some problems such as martial issues, racial identity, or the way they were raised.  Million of people go thru those types of issues all the time.  If the athletes were Mike Tyson or Randy Moss or Jason Williams, my opinion would definitely be different because the actions that these individuals did were against the law or morally unacceptable by society.

===message:I can not say I am the biggest sports fan nor am I allowed to say I do not watch sports, because I could not live without my College Football games (Go Dawgs!).  However sports in general have become an over popularized economic gain in favor of a few.  Back when sports were getting to become more popular with Americans, the athletes themselves wanted to compete for the simplest pride in the world, their ability.  No amount of money could have made all of the events in the early 20’s popular because money was not an issue before Rickard made boxing a National event.  The athletes before that time were more interested in the pride of being a better athlete than their component instead of how many homeruns they can hit in a single year to see their paycheck explode.  Babe Ruth was idolized because he was literally the average American just with an extra ability.  He was an alcoholic, he had seen hard times, and just like everyone else, his life was far from being perfect, however, he could do something amazing even though he was a faux pas. (People felt as though he was on their level even though he was famous.)  Plus Babe Ruth revolutionized baseball, once the ball was revolutionized itself.  He was the first to hit so many homeruns for the great sport and him being a man of people…amazing. As for Joe Luis, his ability was first overexploited because of the racial differences in Americans.  He was an amazing athlete ‘for his color’ and that was why people admired him.  However once Hitler began to exploit his beliefs, Joe Luis and Max Schmeling became the leaders of political rivalry with their ability.  Then Joe Luis was admired by ALL Americans because he was representing our country in boxing matches.  I believe Joe Luis was somewhat over looked until the ‘right cause’ (Nationalism) came around for his popularity to become exploited for the Nation instead of his ability. I do not know of any athlete that is admirable in my eyes because I feel as though athletes these days care more about the paycheck instead of the fun of the game or just the shear enjoyment of the game because of their ability.  The athletes that people do admire, i.e. Michael Jordon, Chipper Jones, Derek Jeter, have no admirable qualities.  I do not see them running out and fighting for some ‘great cause’, instead I see them on MTV cribs showing off their luxurious homes that their homeruns or free throws last year made able for them to afford.  The other athletes, such as Mike Tyson you mentioned, should have been banned from ANY sporting event for the rest of his life.  That does nothing but corrupt the younger generations (and sometimes found in the older generations) and their viewpoints of sports and the events in general.  All of the fights after games between the team that won against the ‘losers’, the violence that it demonstrates that is brought into our homes, etc.  I can not say I could live without college football because I can not.  It is a time every Saturday I look forward to enjoying.  A few hours (technically around 12 hours) every weekend where I can go and yell, let off some steam, jump up and down for my team, and just have a enjoyable time watching an event that I feel has not been too over exploited, does not hurt anything.

===message:Babe Ruth and Joe Louis symbolized the strength and determination of Americans.  Athletes such as these displayed the success of America and Americans took pride in their acomplishments.  In today's society, Micheal Jordan and Tiger Woods are athletes that most admire for their finesse, courtesy, and charisma. I do not personally know Micheal Jordan or Tiger Woods but it seems as if they represent an accurate depiction of these qualities.  Today's athletes reflect the change in our society's morals and values.  It is simply not a good analogy to try to compare athletes of the past to those of today.  Much of the illegal or unethical behavior portrayed by many athletes is simply a representation of our own society's lack of value for each other and to uphold a code of ethics.

===message:People admired Babe Ruth and Joe Louis for simply being like them. For example, The Babe was like the average man who drank and liked to have fun - just like the average U.S. citizen. But what made Ruth a man to be admired was that he seemed to have the uncanny ability to hit home runs. The general public identified with The Babe because he could just as easily be the man next door or that guy sitting across the aisle at church. The current generation of athletes seem to suffer from severe narcissistic flaws. Conversely, the athletes that seem to be admired the most today are the ones with the smallest egos. Michael Jordan, Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter, Brett Favre, Jack Nicklaus, and Joe Montana (to name a few) all play or played their respective sports in a manner that reflects the values of the general American public and, not coincidentally, have had the most success and "staying power".  Unfortunately, there are also players that play for themselves and give no respect to those who forged American sports before them. What varies today is the tired act of a growing percentage of athletes who play the game without regard for the game itself. This is especially prevalent in the NBA. Professional basketball has evolved from a five-on-five contest to five simultaneous one-on-one competitions where all of the emphasis is on individual players. The fan base of the NBA has dwindled dramatically over recent years due to this transformation. The basic American value is one of sacrifice, teamwork, and selflessness. And while the slam-dunk may be initially exciting, it soon becomes stale because the viewing public finds it hard to relate to on a social level. Nonetheless, American sports have defined a certain part of our social culture and it’s purpose is not just for entertainment - it never has been. It represents the desire for the better team to be victorious, to fight the good fight, and to see the discounted surprise the favorite. All of these are reflections of the culture of America.

===message:People admired Joe Lewis and Babe Ruth because they came from ordinary or even substandard homes and rose to stardom via their talent in sports. The American dream was to start at the bottom and work your way up, so what better way to find success, than to excel sports. Success and fame are possible in sports and thats what many American craved. The American public lived out their fantasies through sports heroes such as Ruth, Dempsey and Lewis. American values were all built around that all important American Dream and it was that dream that the athletes reflected.  Today people admire athletes like Venus and Serena Williams, Tiger Woods, and Michael Jordan. People admire athletes first for their athletic talent, but also for their healthy lifestyle. So many people today want to exercise and be active, but so many of us fall in to that rut of work and stress. Also, popularity of American sports heroes depends on the degree of charisma and looks. People people admire athletes because today as well as at the beginning of the twentieth century, people admire the ability of a human to surpass limits in physical ability. Before Babe Ruth, people probably had no idea that a man could hit as many home runs as did Ruth in his career. I agree that for the most part the athletes that I named are admirable, as far as I know they live pretty clean lifestyles and reached their goals through hard work and determination. If I had have been speaking of such athletes as Tyson, Moss, Williams, or Caminity as today’s most admirable (in the eyes of the public) sports heroes, I would not agree that they are admirable because they have done many not-so-admirable things in their careers. Such offenses include drug and steroid useage as well as various acts of violence.

Athletes like Joe Louis and Babe Ruth signified so much for so many people.  In a time of hardship and unemployment, people were able to look up to these athletes as heroes and be amazed by their talents.  The entire nation could rally around an American athlete, who was competing against a  German communist, and feel like they were cheering their country on not just the athlete.   Also, their were not as many "superstar" athletes.  The average man could not do the things that these men did in their respected fields.  It was a form of entertainment and escape.  The sports of today are much more a form of entertainment than a reason for national pride.  Yes they do get paid alot of money.  Yes some of them do go to jail but that is society.  Just because someone has alot of money does not make them less human.  You would think with all that money it would keep some of them out of trouble but again they are as human as you and I.  Their are a few that could be considered role models if I had to select an athlete as a role model.  These days their are so many other great people out there in other professions that I think deserve that sort of acalade.

===message:   Joe Lewis and Babe Ruth were rare superstars in their respective sports, leaving spectators awed with their consistent top rate performances over numerous years.  The two accomplished deeds not seen in sports up until their appearances and not duplicated until recent years by Jordan in basketball and Gretzky in hockey.  ESPN ranked Babe Ruth as the number 2 North American athlete of the century and the first baseball player on the list.  Joe Lewis was listed eleventh and the top boxer.  So from the start the abilities and talent of these two extraordinary athletes were highly admired.
   Note that their personalities appeared different as Ruth was more of in your face type of guy while Lewis let his fists do his talking.  Race may have played a part in Lewis’ demeanor as he was the first black heavyweight champion since Johnson and wanted to avoid the problems that confronted Johnson.
   The athletes most admired today are Michael Jordan, the US women’s soccer team, and Barry Bonds.  Jordon has accomplished marks not previously seen in basketball and ESPN ranked him as the top athlete of the century.  Notice I am talking sports prowess as offered by Bonds whose accomplishments are legendary yet has a reputation (media driven?) for brooding and moodiness.  Comparing Tyson and to lesser degree Moss or Caminiti to Ruth or Jordan or Lewis seems unfair.  First the media since probably Watergate exposes the negative side of the athlete much greater than that faced by the allegedly womanizing often drunk Ruth.  Max McGee is a legend for his performance with a hangover during Superbowl I.  Today he would have been exposed by the media before the game and probably not been allowed to suit up.  Why not compare Ruth to McGuire or Sosa or the football player who joined the army giving up millions, or the other way with the 1919 “Black” Sox to Carl Lewis, who put his 1984 100 meters Olympics gold medal into his father’s coffin.  In other words, sports has had heroes and rogues for decades, but Charles Barkley, known for his brutal honesty, sums it up when he talks about the spotlight on the entire athlete including his personal life: 

	"We (athletes) are held to such a higher standard, and we should be. But come on, don't go crazy. Don't make us out to be Public Enemy No. 1 because we do one thing wrong. Athletes do 99 percent good things and 1 percent bad things, and people never let you forget about that 1 percent."

===message:People admired Joe Louis and Babe Ruth because they symbolized the everyday Joe.  People could identify themselves with these men, “If they could do this so could I”.  Today, the athletes some people admire are: Michael Jordan, Barry Bonds, Tiger Woods and Pete Sampras.  There are several qualities that these athletes possess that make them admirable.  People admire Michael Jordan for his ability to play basketball and play it very well.  He is also a very good team leader.  He is able to pull a team together and inspire every player to play to the best of his ability.  Barry Bonds can be compared to Babe Ruth (the home run King).  Barry Bonds is admirable because of all the baseball records he has set and even broken.  The press is not very kind to him mainly because he chooses not to speak with them as some less admirable athletes choose too.  Tiger Woods is a very good example of a very admirable athlete.  He is young, but very disciplined and a very good golfer.  He portrays a very good imagine and is very well spoken.  He also has the ability to get a younger generation interested in the sport of golf.  Pete Sampras is an example of an athlete being able to use discipline and stay at the top of his sport.  He showed this with his most recent win at the U.S. Open.  I admire these athletes because even with all their success they have managed to remain tops in their chosen sports.  These athletes are admirable also because of the determination to play and excel in their chosen sports.  I am sure that they probably possess some nature talent, but they also had to spend many hours of practice to achieve what they have achieved.  If the athletes that people said they admired were named Mike Tyson, Randy Moss, Jason Williams or Ken Caminiti my answer would be different.  I do not think that these athletes are admirable.  They have embarrassed themselves and the sports they play.  I would not want my children to look up to these athletes on or off the field of sport.

More of a world athlete than an American athlete that is admirable today is Ronaldo who is a Huge soccer star from Brazil.  Others I guess would be Micheal Jordan.  These athletes are admired due to being at the top of the game and the most productive players of their sports.  These players are admirable for being as good as they are but not for being the people that they are.

In a time that the world was melancholy and full of desparation, these people provided and outlet.  Joe Louis was looked at as a great fighter, winning 22 matches and beating every heavyweight contender until Schmelling, as an African-American and as an American, he was a GREAT FIGHTER!  Babe Ruth was also a great baseball player, known for hitting the most homeruns.  Americans back then looked up to these men as heroes, and took pride in that these men were first and foremost Americans.  They gave people a reason to feel a stronger sense of pride for their country.  Some athletes of today that people admire are Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Andre Agassi, and the Williams' sisters.  People admire these athletes for being some of the greatest in their craft.  They receive millions of dollars in endorsements and they provide great entertainment.  I would say these athletes are admirable because they have talent, and they have worked hard to become the best in their craft.  Any athlete that works hard at their craft should be admired.  I'm not saying that they should be looked up to as role models, I just respect anyone that is dedicated.  I can respect Tyson, Moss and Williams as great sports figures, although I don't codone any of their actions.  Sports figures are regular people, and that is what should be remembered.  A lot of Americans in this day in age don't have the same values as people did back then.  Today, people value the amount of money a person makes.  So I would say, yes, I would answer the question the same way.  I admire great athletes, and I try not to look too much into their personal lives because they are regular people too.

They were both great athletes and excelled in their sport better then anyone then and now.They brought Americans together when they played because everyone wanted to watch two talented people that they could look up to. Whether they were black or white and sat next to eachother it did not matter for that point in time while the fight was going on. Bebe Ruth was especially admired because he was just an average American. He did not grow up in wealthy family, he had many problems such as alcoholism, an addiction to smoking, etc. So they looked at him as a regular person who prospered inspite of his misfortune. For a long time Joe Lewis was overlooked until the match against Max Schmeling. He brought a symbol of nationalism, for Germany this was an extra hard slap in face to be beaten by someone of an inferior race. They both symbolized strength, determination, and hard work. I think that the athletes today are overrated and over paid. Many of them do not have very good reputations and when they are in the media it's not because they gave millions of dollars to charities, it's because they are commiting crimes and going to jail. I have a younger brother and these are not the types of people that I want him to look up. I do not want him to think that it is cool to have a "bad-boy" image, as so many famous people do.

Boxing became a very entertaining sport and Joe Louis drew many people to the arena to watch him fight. These athletes reflected contemporary American values by giving the people interesting past times. Many people wanted to be assured that things were better than they really were and if saving their wages up to attend a sporting event was going to reassure them, the atheletes were more than willing to oblige.

The whole idea of sports was still initially political for many leaders.  Athletes were used for national identity and caused sometimes-bitter rivalries. For the U.S., Joe Lewis was not frowned upon because he was a black man. Rather he was representing an entire nation – the United States –, which drew support from all races.  The same applied to Babe Ruth in the sport of baseball.  For those people not in the spotlight, these sports were enjoyed as a past time.  However, since Joe Louis and Babe Ruth were known throughout the country and many others, they had to take on the responsibility of representing the nation.  Although neither athlete was perfect, they competed with pride for their nation and were great athletes.  That is what we all admire.  It is hard to compare these athletes to those of today. Joe Louis and Babe Ruth excelled at their own sports while also overcoming the effects of recent wars and depression. Athletes today cannot begin to imagine this struggle…. Especially Mike Tyson who would immediately crumble……okay okay so I don’t like Mike :o) Athletes like Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson to name a couple are admirable but never in the same sense of pride and country that I think people viewed Joe Louis and Babe Ruth.

They felt they could relate with him more.  Joe Louis was admired because he was the first black athlete that was allowed to compete.  Not only did he start the integration of other races into sports, he defeated the Nazi German boxer.  This was a great defeat for America.  Sports gave rise to the dreams of the common man.  They were played by and for the working man, and individuals during this era needed dreams and a spark of hope.  The athletes that are admired the most are people such as Micheal Jordan and Tiger Woods because they over exceed the expectations of the "normal" athlete. Their abilities go beyond the physical requirements of most athletes.  People admire their "super-human" abilities to be extremely good at what they do.  I don't believe that these are the traits that need to be admired.  I believe that admirable qualities stem from deep inside a person, and they show by the way they interact with their community and people who are not as fortunate as they are.  Some athletes do possess this quality, but overall most athletes are not active members of trying to make a better place for others.  If the individuals were Mike Tyson and Randy Moss, the answer would be different.  I understand that people have problems, but these men are constantly in the public eye and children look up to them.  Even though they possess extraordinary physical abilities, this does not excuse how they behave or how they should be punished.  They are just "ordinary people" and need to be treated that way regardless of their name.
