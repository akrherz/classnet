===message:
The America segments of the episode really emphasized how much better Americans had it than the rest of the world. The people in the segment were very happy; they were experiencing a life without worries; a life that was only getting better. Everyday tasks were becoming easier and taking less time to complete. I think the segment generalized what American culture was experiencing. Just as today, on the surface everybody seems to have it good, but we all are aware of the ghettos, slums, and all the poverty that exists in our own cities. It was the same in the fifties. People from the Deep South were not represented, scores of blacks and senior citizens were also left out of the picture. In just about every area there was at least some population suffering from poverty.

===message:Most people in American in the 1950s were doing better.  Work was easy to find; salaries were increasing, and new inventions such as the washing machine and other time-saving devices were pouring out of the factories to hungry consumers who couldn’t get enough of them.  Most people had a positive outlook and were confident in their futures.  This was fairly accurate for most Americans.  Still, there were some disadvantaged Americans who had a more difficult time than mainstream America such as African Americans and other minorities especially in the South where protests for equal rights began.  In addition, many Europeans were destitute after the war and it took them several years and $13 billion of aid from the Marshall Plan to get them back on their feet again.

===message:It was very interesting to see how this segment depicted the lives of “Americans” after World War II.  According to the people in the segment, and the segment itself, a large percentage of “Americans” were employed and prosperous.  There were good wages paid and money to spend on countless amounts of consumer goods.  With the increase in real wages “Americans” were buying homes in sprawling new suburban settings.  I put the word Americans in quotations to put emphasis on the fact that the highly employed and prosperous “Americans” depicted in the segment did not represent all citizens of the country.  The people in the segment seemed very proud in detailing what it was like growing up and living in middle-class suburbia during the 1950’s.  I’ll pose this question as an analogy.  How would you describe your college experience?  A student that lives at home or in the dorm, does not work, and tuition is paid by their parents would have a different answer from someone who worked full time, had to pay bills (rent), and had student loans.   If you were to ask the average non-white non-middle class American to describe life in 1950’s America, the picture would be completely different from those in the segment.  I understand this question could be asked of many Americans and you would receive several different depictions of 1950’s America.  The question asked whether I thought this particular segment described this time in America accurately.  For some Americans, the descriptions the people in the segment gave may be accurate.  They may have grown up in nice homes with automobiles and new appliances and a father who had a good paying (permanent) job.  I don’t think I have to point out or go into detail about how this depiction of the average American household during the 1950’s was not the norm for all Americans.  For the most part, the only people depicted in the entire segment were “non-minority” and non-middle class Americans.  That is a very large segment of people not to consider when asking a group of Americans what life was like in 1950’s America

===message:As real income(adjusted for inflation) rose, Americans spent less of their income on necessities. They enthusiastically bought powered lawn mowers, air conditioners, and striped toothpaste and heaped their shopping carts with frozen, dehydrated, and fortified foods. When they lacked cash, they borrowed. In 1950, Diners' Club issued the first credit card and American Express soon followed. Installment buying, home mortgages, and auto loans raised Americans' private indebtedness in the 1950s. Advertising expenditures nearly tripled; business spent more on advertising than the nation did on schools.
Government policy as well as the proliferation of spurred white Americans' exodus to the suburbs. The tax code stimulated home sales by allowing deductions for home-mortgage interest payments and for property taxes. The Federal Housing Administration(FHA) and the Veterans Administration(VA) offered low-interest loans.
Eight-five percent of the 13 million new homes built in the 1950s were in the suburbs. Affordable single-family housing drew many Americans there. Others fled the central cities' crime, grime, and newly urbanized minorities. Young couples headed for suburbia in quest of communities oriented toward children and education.
Social critics lampooned the "split-level trap," but most suburbanities enjoyed their new life-style, tranquil surroundings, and like-minded neighbors. To a nation of immigrants, most from counries where only the elite owned property having a home of one's own was at the core of the American dream.

===message:Boom Time presents a time of prosperity for America.  It was a period of endless possibility and confidence. The people were joyful and seemed to have no worries.  Jobs were plentiful and money was good.  Luxuries that seemed so far out of reach now were easily accessible and common.  People began to enjoy more than just the necessities of life. They enjoyed vacations, cars, washing machines, dishwashers and many other luxuries.  Although this may represent the majority of America during this time, there is a large segment of Americans that is not represented in this program.  There were still poor Americans that lived in the ghettos of America that seemed forgotten.  Television and other avenues of communication only painted the good picture for other countries to envy.

===message:Apart from the land-power of the Red army, the overwhelming industrial power of the United States had been the decisive material factor behind the Allied victory. America had equipped not only her own huge forces but also those of her allies. Moreover, by comparison with them, victory had cost her little. For American aid (The Marshal Plan) to recover Europe as a major world center of industrial production, the American dynamo had to be there to power it. The enormous wartime expansion of the American economy that brought it out of the prewar depression, together with the immunity of the American home base from physical damage, had ensured that it would be. This is the impression I got from the film segment. It also depicted thousands of young servicemen coming back to America to pick up their lives and start new families in new homes with new jobs. With energy never before experienced, American industry expanded to meet peacetime needs. Americans began buying goods not available during the war, which created corporate expansion and jobs.  Growth everywhere.  The baby boom was underway and so was the golden age of the family. Happily married men and women lived in suburban homes raising families. Women gleefully fulfilled their roles as mothers and wives while men contently worked to provide for their families. The “nuclear family” of the 1950's arose due to particular circumstances involving both America’s past and its future. Instead of just prosperity, the definition of the American dream expanded to include the family; the dream became profoundly domestic.

People had good jobs, lived in good and affordable houses, had cars, and were able to provide for their families.  For the majority, that account was accurate, but for the minorities and poor people, the account was not accurate.  In the 1950s’, we still had widespread discrimination against minorities especially blacks.   Blacks were discriminated against in buses, eating places, work areas, and were not even given the opportunity to buy houses in certain areas designated for the whites.   The account did not include the fact that we had poor people living in the ghettos who were totally ignored during this time of "plenty".  I also noticed that the very poor, and blacks were not included in the success stories of the boom time.

This was the time our country exploded in the economy and manufactured goods we produced.  It was the time that Americans were able to enjoy everyday appliances, leisure activities, and entertainment that only the rich were able to do until the 50’s came along.  The people in the segment can be describe as fortunate because they were growing up in a time that the world was evolving to support all of the American’s needs.  I believe the segment represented the lives of the 50’s pretty accurately, however a lot was not represented.  African Americans, Politics, and a lot of the other side of the world were not spoken for.

===message:One issue that was not emphasized in the film was the plight of the African-American. A century after emancipation, the black American was likely to be poorer, more often on relief, more often unemployed, less well housed and less healthy than the white American. Thirty years later, this was still, sadly, even more the case. In the 1950’s, though, there was widespread optimism about changing things. The African-American position in society suddenly began to appear intolerable and became a great political question because of three facts. One was migration. Between 1940 and 1960 the African-American population of the Northern states almost tripled. This turned a local Southern question into a national problem. Moreover, it brought the plight of African-Americans into view not only in new places, but also in new ways. It revealed that the problem facing them was not only one of legal rights, but more complex. It involved economic and cultural deprivation as well. The second fact pushed the question onto the international stage. Many of the new nations, which were becoming a majority at the United Nations during this period, were nations of colored peoples. It was an embarrassment, of which communist propaganda made good use, for the United States to display at home so flagrant a violation of the ideals she advocated abroad. Finally, the actions of African-Americans themselves under their own leaders, some inspired by Gandhian principles of passive resistance to oppression, won over many whites. In the end the legal and political position of African-Americans was radically altered for the better as a result. Bitterness and resentment were not eliminated in the process, though, and in some places actually increased and more African-Americans than before remained poor and deprived.

They started to let there guard down a bit and enjoy life. We had alot of open free trade now with countries all over the world. We where importing as well as exporting goods which provided jobs as well as enabled us to buy things we where not able to before. Technology was moving ahead with leaps and bounds. But Boom Time was for white america. The white people moved out to the suburbs and had the house with the white picket fence, the 2.5 children and the dog. They depicted a life of prosperity and happiness. The wife stayed home and raised the kids and the dad was the primary bread winner. There was still much poverty in america though. Rural areas such as the south where still very poor. There where lots of tenant farms. So Boom Time just shows a portion of what America was like then.

===message:The 1950’s was a time of unprecedented growth in the American economy. This magnitude of the "boom" was largely due to the economic shambles that the U.S. was in for so long before the war. There was nowhere for it to go but up - and it certainly did. Men who were, a few years earlier, fighting for their lives on beaches and in foxholes were anxious to partake in the prosperity after so many years of living in a state of peril they wondered if they would escape from alive. My own grandfather was married just six months after returning from the Pacific. He, not unlike other soldiers, built his house with money from the G.I. Bill. Within five years, my grandparents also had three children. It was, I’m sure, an exciting time for a man who grew up the son of a sharecropper. The possibilities probably seemed endless. I think the representation of life in the post-war context of this film was accurate. However, certain aspects of 1950’s American society were omitted such as the African-American struggle for equal treatment.

It was also easier for people to get a job because of the mass production.  As time went on, so did the boom, products were commercialized.  The people were very happy.  They had very little struggle.  They had options on what they wanted to buy for their house.

Were you a kid in the Fifties or so ? 

Everybody makes fun of our childhood! Comedians joke. 

Grandkids snicker. Twenty-something's shudder and say "Eeeew!" 

But was our childhood really all that bad? 

Judge for yourself: 







In 1953 The US population was less than 150 million... 

Yet you knew more people then, and knew them better... 

And that was good. 





The average annual salary was under $3,000...

Yet our parents could put some of it away for a rainy day and still live a decent life... 

And that was good. 

 

      



A loaf of bread cost about 15 cents...

 But it was safe for a five-year-old to skate to the store and buy one... 

And that was good. 

 






 









Prime-Time meant I Love Lucy, Ozzie and Harriet, Gunsmoke and Lassie... 

So nobody ever heard of ratings or filters... 

And that was good. 

 





We didn't have air-conditioning... 

So the windows stayed up and half a dozen mothers ran outside 
when you fell off your bike... 

And that was good. 

 





Your teacher was either Miss Matthews or Mrs. Logan or Mr. Adkins... 

But not Ms Becky or Mr.Dan... 

And that was good. 

 





The only hazardous material you knew about...

Was a patch of grassburrs around the light pole at the corner... 

And that was good. 

 





You loved to climb into a fresh bed... 

Because sheets were dried on the clothesline... 

And that was good. 

 



People generally lived in the same hometown with their relatives... 

So "child care" meant grandparents or aunts and uncles... 

And that was good. 
  



Parents were respected and their rules were law.... 

Children did not talk back..... 

and that was good. 

 



TV was in black-and-white... 

But all outdoors was in glorious color....

And that was certainly good. 

 



Your Dad knew how to adjust everybody's carburetor... 

And the Dad next door knew how to adjust all the TV knobs... 

And that was very good. 

 




Your grandma grew snap beans in the back yard...

And chickens behind the garage... 

And that was definitely good. 

 















And just when you were about to do something really bad... 

Chances were you'd run into your Dad's high school coach... 

Or the nosy old lady from up the street... 

Or your little sister's piano teacher... 

Or somebody from Church... 

ALL of whom knew your parents' phone number...

And YOUR first name... 

And even THAT was good! ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ REMEMBER.... 

 

 









Send this on to someone who can still remember Nancy Drew, The Hardy Boys, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, Sky King, Little Lulu comics, Brenda Starr, Howdy Doody and The Peanut Gallery, The Lone Ranger, The Shadow Knows, Nellie Belle, Roy and Dale, Trigger and Buttermilk as well as the sound of a reel mower on Saturday morning,  and summers filled with bike rides, playing in cowboy land, playing hide and seek and kick-the-can and Simon Says, baseball games, amateur shows at the local theater before the Saturday matinee, bowling and visits to the pool...and eating Kool-Aid powder with sugar, and wax lips and bubblegum cigars 










Didn't that feel good, just to go back and say, Yeah, I remember that! And was it really that long ago?

The black and poor (which were probably synonymous in those times for most, although I am sure there were a handful of poor whites) were not represented in this video segment. The video showed just how disillusioned most Americans were during this period of time.

===message:The impressions given by the program of life in the 1950’s was that life was great for the people who were 
given the opportunities to make a good living for their families. Those fortunate families seemed to have just about anything they wanted if they could afford it. The spot light did not shine on the segments of the population who were not being given the same opportunity to succeed.  The program dealt with the production of consumer goods and how the United States was very efficient at turning out these good to sell at home and abroad.
