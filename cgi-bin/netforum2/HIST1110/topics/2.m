===subject:Are we better off today?
===message:Are we better off today than we were 100 years ago? My answer to this is simply no. The revolution in the minds of men throughout the world which has been going on with increasing intensity is the idea that continuous material improvement is possible. With this improvement has been the growing success in the manipulation of the environment. Unfortunately, humanity’s success in manipulating its world is threatened by two tendencies. One is that success creates new problems and does so perhaps too rapidly for answers to be found before irreversible damage is done. Thus we face the problems of depleted natural resources, disturbance of existing ecologies, the creation of new stresses and dangers such as those involved in gathering people into great cities. The second tendency is that the achievements of science outrun our capacity to manage the power they give us. Examples are the dangers inherent in already irreversible damage to the environment, in the proliferation of nuclear weapons, or the reduction in death rate through medical advance, which leads to rapid population growth, in interference with the genetic process through in vitro fertilization, or genetic engineering. If such misgivings prove justified, then the present age will indeed seem to our successors to mark a break in historical continuity. It might imply that the progressive power to control the environment, which marked the whole of earlier history and all known prehistory, was at an end. On the other hand, there are still no reasons to believe that the ways of discovering techniques to meet problems in the past cannot again be utilized successfully in the future. All that is different though, is that change is quite simply more sweeping and faster than ever before. Whatever we do, we are likely to be gravely misled about the future if we simply extrapolate present trends. We must be prepared for discontinuity as well as continuity. Another danger that we face as a country is political. It is no longer a matter of the superpowers themselves and their ability to manage their relationships, but the context in which the international balance must be preserved. The responsible leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union appeared, even a couple of decades ago, to have accepted the fact that they could not be sure of imposing their will on each other by threat of war. They were also aware that victory in any real sense would be impossible in a full-scale nuclear war. But the superpowers have to live in a world which is changing and threatened still by destabilization. The giants no longer confront one another on an empty stage. It is filling up rapidly, and the bit-players have their own lines they long to deliver. Some of them have been waiting a long time to do so and are impatient while others are frightened. This is all the more dangerous. Regrettably, the realization that a nuclear war might mean the destruction for mankind is still not shared by rulers in all countries.

===message:When I first read this question my immediate answer was yes we are better off today than we were a hundred years ago, but now that I have spent sometime thinking about this question I am not so sure.  Yes, we are better off medically.  Life expectancy is a lot longer than it use to be thanks to medical advancements, such as heart tranplants, and technology, such as dialysis.  Socially I do not think we are better off.  As little as fifty years ago Parents could feel safe letting their children go to a neighborhood park to play.  Today it is not safe to let your child play in your front yard unattended.  Also a hundred years ago divorce was rare if ever heard of.  Today about fifty percent of marriages end in divorce which leads to a new term "dysfunctional family".  With so many children today living in single parent homes children begin to believe that maybe they had done something wrong that maybe somehow they were the cause of the divorce.  This can lead to low self-esteem and a lot of other social problems.  So I have to voice my opinion as NO we are better off today than we were a hundred years ago.

===message:Are people's lives today better than people's live one hundred years ago? YES.
The reason I say yes, because we have the advancement of medical research, communication and technology, transportation, education, and jobs.
Medical research has increase from separting conjoin twins, AIDS and Cancer treatment, animal cloning and body enchancements.
The advancement of Communication and Technology invents something new every year from PC and lap top computers(large and small), cellular phones with cameras, fax and email, digital cable or satelite systems, DVD or VCR, alarm systems, computer games, and Flat Screen TVs.
Transportation has allowed several ways people can travel such as planes, your choice and size of automobiles, trains, buses, and crusing on ships.
Man can even travel to the moon through the source of NASA space rocket ship.
Education has improved since one hundred years ago, we have several choices of colleges/universities to choose from based on career choice and different types of degrees from certicates, associates, bachelors, masters, doctorate.
People have variety of jobs to choose from than people one hundred years ago such as educators, bus drivers, police, fire fighters, salespersons, TV/Newspaper reporters, business owners, government agencies, President and etc.
People have gain many advantages than one hundred years ago.
Life was so limited then and there was not a lot of things to choose from such as jobs and education.

===message:There are, without question, more opportunities and conveniences today than there were 100 years ago. However, I don’t think that quality of life can be measured by the televisions in our living rooms or the cell phones in our pockets. The world in 1900 possessed an innocence that was lost and, I am afraid, cannot be regained. 
Because of the world-wide race to become more advanced and more economically sound, individual countries and regions in the early twentieth century held a great sense of nationalism and pride. With the implementation of the League of Nations and then the United Nations, we seem to be living now in a world where citizens find it like second nature to overlook  needs in our homeland while focusing on the state of the world as a whole. For instance, even after the terrorist attacks of last year, there is an alarming number of U.S. citizens who believe that America should stand down in the face of  an aggressor because a military response might ruffle a few feathers in other regions of the world. Could past generations have imagined – a group of people risking their own safety and preservation to make sure no one’s feelings are hurt?  Lest we forget that the same security that is now in danger was won by the blood of  my father, grandfather and great-grandfather as well as yours?
Since the video alluded to all major regions of the world along the same timeline, it became apparent to me that we, as Americans are indeed worse off today than 100 years ago because of the shift of the United States from a nationalist-minded people to a people who are divided when it come to the interests of self-preservation and self-advancement. Conversely, countries such as China, Japan, England, Russia and Germany all seem to have held on to most of the pride that they possessed in the early twentieth century while also enjoying the technologies and conveniences of today.

===message:Considering the fact that 100 years ago humanity entered the beginning of the twentieth century and are in the first years of the twenty-first century, the question remains as to whether or not humanity has a better quality of life.  I will base my answer on 3 main issues which concerned the world at the dawn of the twentieth century and are current issues today.  Health, peace, and technological advancements are three of the most important topics which have and will have a lasting effect on the quality of life for humanity.  
According to Episode 1 of the PBS video, the 1st decade of the 20th century included more free time which was exercised via amusement parks and baseball games.  In contrast, at the start of the 21st century most people especially in the United States work 40 or more hours per week, not including the extra time to maintain households and family.  It is not necessarily better for people in general to have a more hectic schedule simply because this adds stress which of course is not beneficial to one’s health and well-being.
	Consistent with Episode 1, the world had seen four decades of peace before the onset of World War I and was relatively in a state of peace.  Our time period has not been so lucky because humanity has been plagued with violence in the form of terrorism.  Unfortunately, this war against terrorism is unlike the wars of old similar to World War I.  This of course creates a poorer quality of life for us than at the start of the twenty-first century because we are not in a state of peace and the world is fighting a war unlike any other.
	The start of the twentieth-century began a new age of enlightenment in the areas of science and technology according to Episode 1.  The Paris Exhibition in 1900 featured new advancements such as moving sidewalks and pictures.  Later in this decade, the discovery and use of electricity was a major technological innovation.  As far as technological advancement is concerned, our start in the 21st century is not unlike that of the 20th century.  We are gaining progress in the areas of advanced communications such as the Internet and cellular communications.  In additions, the computing field has seen a surge in advancements.  Humanity is far more advanced from the technology aspect and is better equipped for the world as a result.
	
     As far as peace and stress concerns due to health, the world as a whole is not really in a better situation than at the start of the 20th century.  Technology is at a higher level of quality than it was 100 years ago.  As a result humanity is not necessarily in a better situation, but we are better in the technology field.

===message:My answer to this question is yes and no.  For the yes, as far as science, the medical field, technology, and health, these have certainly advanced in our society.  However, so much emphasis has been put on this that many people have forgotten about family values.  What I mean is that there isn't time in anyone's life for the "important things."  People are working more and more hours nowdays than ever before.  These advances in the above fields have worked for us and against us so much that I could compare this all day.  Earlier, when wars and/or battles were fought, the only people that were killed were the soldiers on the field.  With todays technology being so advanced the battle field has become closer to home than ever before, such as September 11th.  Who'd ever thought that when the Wright brothers invented the airplane that decades later it would be used as a weapon!!!!!

The fact that jobs are causing stress to our lives are nothing in comparison to the stressful situations people one hundred years ago faced.  Basic sicknesses killed healthy people all the time.  Yes getting back to a basic lifestyle seems great on the cover of it all, but lets face it, people of today have aquired such a fancy lifestyle from all the technological advances in our society that we can't even fathom the true harsh lifestyle of a person living one hundred years ago

Though today's world is not filled with total equality, it is still better than even about 50 or 60 years ago. Women, Blacks, and everyone else that's is not of Caucasian background now have the right to vote, work wherever, and even step outside their houses without being harassed. Technology has also brought us a long way. The video said that life expectancy was 45; today people live far beyond 45 yrs due to new medical advances ex: transplants, cures, and vaccines. New modes of transportation, entertainment, etc. The many advances of today have help make the world grow in numerous ways.

===message:I have to say that there are both good and bad aspects to this question. Of course all the technological and medical advances have helped us immensely .  With these advancements we have also created a lot of problems as well. 100 years ago many of the diseases we have now we did not have back then. Of course most of the diseases we had back then are not even heard of today because of the advancement in medical technology.  So you pay the price either way I think. You basically are trading one for the other. 

I also feel that we have traded our values and moral standards for the technology we have today. 100 years ago there where no cars, Televisions, computers and such.  Families where very close knit. The invention of the automobile made traveling faster and easier. Then later came air travel.  So, as we advance we also loose as well.  We again trade one for the other in the long run.

I recently started substitute teaching this past year. I have no kids so I had not been inside a public school for I guess 15 or 20 years. I was totally floored at the way kids act today. I know when I went to school, you sat in your desk, keep  your mouth closed and did what you where supposed to do. Today kids can’t sit still, they talk all the time, and they do not concentrate on their work. I spend over half the day with disciplinary problems while trying to  get them to do their assigned work. This is not  just because I am a sub and they are giving me a hard time, as I see how the teachers also have problems as well. 

You can contribute this to technology.  Parents don’t have the time to sit down now with their kids because they work all the time. It takes both parents now to make it. 100 years ago, even 50 years ago, dad worked and mom stayed home with the kids. Dinner was with the whole family. Today, with fast food, mom and dad working, everyone scattered about, you hardly ever sit down to a dinner with the whole family.  Computers have opened up a whole new world for today’s kids. It makes it easier for them to do their schoolwork, but it also keeps them from sitting down and talking to their family. Parents today are so busy they use the Computer as a means of entertainment or a baby sitter. So there again you trade one for the other.

===subject:Episode One
===message:There are two aspects to a person’s life.  They are the mental well being and the physical life.  Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution inventions, innovations, medical improvements, and other technical breakthroughs have improved mans’ physical life but man’s mental life has dwindled.  

One hundred years ago mans’ mental life was good.  People were happy and contented but mans’ physical life was filled with things like polio and other diseases.  Telephones were starting to be used widespread.  The Internet was only a Science Fiction writer’s dream and so were computers.  People for the most part had something to believe in, like God, the bible and the extended family, and this is what made people mentally stronger back in 1902, especially in this country.  The suicide rate was not as high as it is today.  Children did not go around killing each other over petty stuff.    Children did not have to use drugs as an escape outlet from their problems.  Now we have all this technology but at what cost to our mental health.  

Look at all the technology we have today.  We have made scientific advances like computers, rockets, and jet airplanes that fly at supersonic speed.  We have nuclear bombs, which can destroy whole cities; we have computers that can do computations in a fraction of a second.  Besides these technical wonders, Women and Minorities have gained more equal rights and material improvement.  We have all these technical wonders and all these rights but our mental life has dwindled.  We have kids murdering kids.  We have kids taking drugs and having sex with anyone and everyone to make themselves feel good.  We have many of the adult population on drugs like Valium for depression and other mental ailments.  The suicide rate has gone up since 1902.  All these things are happening are because our mental lives have gone down.  In order to improve mans’ mental lives man including children have to realize their full potential or to self-actualize.  This comes from Dr. Abraham Maslow’s pyramid hierarchy of human needs.  There are five things on his pyramid and starting from bottom, they are Survival, Security, Social Acceptance, Self-Esteem, and Self Actualization.  Right now, I say most adults are in between the Social-Acceptance and Self-Esteem Level, and kids, and teens are between the Security and the Social Acceptance level.  Adults need to find out why they have poor self-esteem by looking deep within themselves and maybe change their environment.  Maybe they can start believing in a religion or something.  Children and teens need to be allowed to self-actualize without harming themselves.  What I mean by this is if a child wants to sing or be a musician and his parents want him to go to law school, the parent needs to let him or her be what he or she wants to be.  The schools need to encourage this also by laying out other options that will help a kid succeed in life.  Kids think by doing drugs and having sex all the time will self-actualize themselves but it will not in the long run even though to them it does in the short run.  This is why our mental lives have degraded is because society for the most part today keeps people at either the lower or the middle rung of the pyramid.  I mean what good is living if you cannot live?

A recent TV show provided insight on how difficult it would be for a 2002 person to live in 1902 because of dependency on technology and a loss of mental fortitude.  I believe that a 1902 person would adapt to the present era and thrive because they would bring with them a certain inner strength as they would benefit from both aspects of a complete healthy person.  While our physical life has improved greatly in the past century due to innovation, inventions, medical improvements and other improvements, our mental lives have degraded.  In order for people to live a better life we have to have both positive physical and mental lives.

===message:Sometimes I feel that we’ve traded one set of problems for another set of problems.  It seems we have vastly improved our lives with the advent of electricity, major improvements in medicine, and the establishment of basic individual rights (particularly for workers in the western world), but for all our technology, why haven’t we eliminated wars, famine, and hunger?  We certainly have the capability to end it, but we simply (as a group) don’t want to.  As an individual, I find this horrible.  I feel we have been given the tools to improve the life of each and every individual on the earth, but humanity as a group has made a “Social Darwinist” choice not to help the less fortunate.  Therefore, I believe that many people’s lives have changed for the better but at the same time, many more are suffering in the same degradation that existed a hundred years ago.

But consider all the poisons in our societies today, and it doesn't seem like we are any better off.

I also think that things are somewhat worse now than they were a hundred years ago. As far as crime is concerned, people are committing crimes today that no one would have thought about back then.  There are more diseases to catch. There are more single parent families. There are more drugs available on the street. There are more crimes committed against children today than their was back then.

For example, think of all the professions that exist today due to the invention of the computer.  Major advancements in the treatment and prevention of diseases that were fatal a century ago, have come in this past century.
If a person reflected on the advancements we have made in the areas of technology, medicine, government, labor and the economy it would be easy to say that our lives were better off than those who lived a century ago.

In the areas of environment and social changes, I find it difficult to say that we are "better off."  We have  continued to make demands on the environment without preparing for the consequences in the past century.  Our air is much more polluted than a century ago, our water systems are low and also more polluted than a century ago. 

As a minority, I feel that minorities and women are still dealing with many of the social inequalities that existed 100 years ago.  Generally speaking, as a whole I do feel as human beings our lives are much better off now than those of our relatives a century ago.

First, having to live through all of the new inventions of electricity and gas, transportation like trains to planes, no one knew what was beneficial enough to invest money into because of all of the new technological inventions.  One woman said someone told her father that electricity was a phase.  Who would like to shower and have only a gas lamp as a light?  




What about the Titanic?  Given the population of America at the beginning of the century, who knows where you would have been born.  Many of us could have been born in France or England under monarchies or Russia under autocracy, and worst of all having to leave our mothers and fathers behind, getting on a ship, even the Titanic, and not knowing the fate that was coming.  Or you could have grown up without a family (because of the low wages and income of workers) your parents were only able to afford a ticket for you to give you a better life in America.




I personally would have not wanted to work in the factories and be a garment worker (most likely out of all of the jobs I would have held, being female).  Working long hours in disgusting environments, no sleep, little pay, no thank you, and even when the workers stood up for their rights and went on strike, no telling what would happen to you by the end of the day.  You or your mom or dad could have ended up in jail, stepped on in the streets by the angry mobs of people, or even worse, punched, kicked, or shot at by the police. (And lets not forget, women had NO political rights either.)




It was probably really interesting growing up in the beginning of the century because of all of the new leisure activities like the movies and baseball, but for the most part, our ancestors had it rough and hard adapting to change and the unstable environment that was to pave the roads for better living, like today.

Improvements in technology, agriculture, medicine, and employment opportunities, have made the world we are living in more habitable and better.  Technology advancement has brought us good things in life.  The transportation industry is so advanced now that varieties of ways can be used to travel, either by land air, or sea.  We have choices of which ones to use, and can travel at our conveniences.  100 years ago, there were not many good roads and many people traveled with carriages, or boats, which made visiting relations or business transactions far away, difficult or impossible.  The invention of radios, telephones, televisions in our time make communication quicker and easier.  Mass production of equipment for farm use and the processing of food have made life better for those involved in agriculture.  Machines are operated to do most of the work, and the human labor is conserved.  Plenty of food products are manufactured and sold at affordable rates to consumers.   The breakthrough in medical research is one of the marked achievements in this century.   Infertile couples can now have children through various ways like in vitro fertilization, artificial insemination, etc.  Some bad hereditary diseases can be detected before a child is born, and appropriate action taken to prevent any unwanted hardships on both the mother and the child.  Because of improvement in medicine, new drugs are now available to treat and cure most diseases that would have killed people instantly 100 years ago.  Moreover, many “State of the Art” Medical facilities are built all over the place to care for the sick.  There are better employment opportunities; people are employed more than ever before.  There is less discrimination in the work places, the gender gap is almost filled, workers are paid on time, good work environments, less work strikes, and riots.

===message:There are definately pros and cons to consider.  Everyone has made excellent points. Overall, we are better off. However, when I think of this question from an American view, I have to compare our way of life to that of all other countries.  Because of the freedom we are able to enjoy, the fact that we are a World power, and the abundanct opportunities we have, we are constantly placed in a state of defense.  We have to be concerned with War and attacks on innocent people simple because other countries are trying to position themselves to compete. The invent of technology, agriculture, automobiles, even nuclear weapons is a driving force in all of the major super powers. We find ourselves struggling to stay on top to maintain the respect of all other nations.  The methods of this positioning, can and has caused negative outcomes to the quality of human life.  When I think of the upcoming anniversary of September 11th, it lies as a perfect example of my point.  Individuals from other countries have influenced such negativity on the American way of life which resulted in suicide missions to kill innocent civilian life - why? Because we are America! Although I am proud to be an American, I cannot dismiss the idea that we as Americans are under constant defense of our advances over the past 100+ years.

===message:"Do you think people's lives are better today than 100 years ago?" When prompted with this question, I came to two corresponding questions. The first question is "which people?" and the second question is "what is 'better'?"
	Upon watching the opening of the first episode of People’s Century, I thought about how fun life looked; the World Exhibition seemed especially appealing to me. Who wouldn’t want to be apart of this exciting new time? Then as I watched I learned that realistically I would only truly enjoy this time if I were at the top of the social ladder.  Many people were struggling to sustain life and many were fighting for their rights.
	The sections in the video about the women’s suffrage movement and the labor unions left me glad to have come along at time when women already have rights and labor laws are set. Sadly, this is not true for the people of  many countries today. Some societies are digressing, politically, economically, as well as socially. These people have not experienced the same revolution in freedom and technological growth as other more developed countries.
    In developed countries medical advancements have been made and people are living longer, healthier lives. Technology has brought about helpful, life-saving innovations in medicine taking the life expectancy level from the average of forty-six years of age to new levels.        
    As I continue think about this question, I could easily say that I am content living now, mostly because I am comfortable with now. Also, the fact that my hindsight tells me that I would’ve had to live through World War I probably has a lot to do with it.  Of course, I have no clue about what’s going to happen in the next five minutes.  Nothing is constant about this world. As improvements have come about through time, destruction in some way or another has followed closely behind.

===message:Are the lives of people better today than they were at the turn of the century?  In many ways yes.  Life expectancy is signifanctly longer than it was in 1900 worldwide.  While there is still a large "3rd world" population, living conditions have progressed and risen in much of the world since the turn of the century.  With the advent of worldwide media, the world's attention has and can be brought to the awareness of social injustice and human rights violoations on a global scale.  Therefore allowing, if nothing else, the potential for reform because of worldwide scrutiny.  Technology has absolutely made life better in many respects.  Whether it be medical, environmental, militarily, etc., there has been great leaps of progress.  Yet I fully believe that there is a part of technology that has dulled and stunted the mental and physical growth of modern day individuals.  The efficiencies that we have been afforded by such advanced technological development has made us fully dependent on things such as computers, cell phones, calculators, frozen and fast food, the clothing store down the street, the grocery store and modern housing and utilities to name a few.  At the turn of the century, to communicate people had to write.  If people wanted to eat, they knew how to plant a garden or make bread from wheat or corn.  If people were cold or in the dark they knew how to build a fire from nothing and they knew how to work oil lamps.  I am by no means saying that by having to do these things, life was better, but it did make "man" fully use his mind and strength instead of relying on something else to do it for him.  I would also say that a by-product of doing these things, is that the family unit was made stronger and was an integral focus of people of that day.  Families were more prone to stay close and support one another during these times than they are today.  In conclusion, I do think that overall things are better now than they were then.  I would only say that we need to remember from where we came, and while embracing the future, don't forget the basics of the past.

===message:I believe that our lives are a lot better today than of those a hundred years ago. Technology, basically, has increased the job market more than it was all of those years ago. White collar jobs were just beginning in the early 1900s, so this means that most people had to work in factories and other perform other back breaking duties. Today, as I have said, thanks to technology, most of our workload has been done by computers and other mechanical devices. Also, most working class people could not earn enough wages to be classified as middle and upper class citizens, the only people who earned the amount of money to be a part of the middle and upper class were doctors and other professionals as well as the owners of the factories that the workers worked in. Today, it is easier for people to find a profession to place them in the middle and upper class pay bracket.

===subject:Better or Worse depends on situation
===message:I have very mixed feelings about whether life is better or worse now compared to 100 years ago.  Of course things are better there are more jobs because of the industrial revolution and the many jobs created by all the technology we have.  We also have many more opportunities today compared to 100 years ago as far as education and employment advancement. Our lives are much easier and for that matter for most of us most of the time much more entertaining.  That's all wonderful especially the jobs and opportunities.   But on the other side there were the simple ways of 100 years ago that would be nice to go back to.  Today we are so pushed and shoved to do more and get more done that we rarely take time to sit back and appreciate all the wonderful things we have.  More often than not simply taking advantage of the wonderful place we live in.  I think 100 years ago not only was the environment cleaner before the industrial revolution but also much more appreciated.  I guess I'm like most people I want my cake and to eat it to and that of course can't happen.  Overall today we are better off I just wish we would all sit back and appreciate it and be thankful for what we have instead of always trying to push for more and more.  Of course I guess this pushing has its place too, if not for all of this pushing we wouldn't be where we are today!

===message:Yes, I do believe in many aspects our lives are better today than one hundred years ago.  Everyone has the right to vote, we have more advanced technology, our life expectancy is longer, we have better labor laws, and just generally more freedoms than we had then.  But, remember, one hundred years ago, they felt that their lives were better than the lives of those one hundred years earlier and one hundred years from now, our descendants will believe that their lives are better than ours are now.  I believe this is because, as the saying goes, "hindsight is 20/20".  We can look back and clearly see the inadequacies of the past, where we can't see them in the present.

===message:I think that people's lives are better and worse than they were one hundred years ago.  People's lives are better because the technology and medical advances that we have today makes life easier and convenient.  On the other hand peoples lives are worse because pollution and crime has increased over the years. In order for people's lives to get better they had to sacrifice other important think.

===message:I am indifferent. I have a medical background, so I'll come from that angle.Yesterday(1902) and today(2002)both are full unknowns. In 1902 we were terrorized by plagues. Between then and now, we have been in a biological war with our main weapon being antibiotics. We say we've won. Have we. I am happy to be in the age of antibiotics that cure but.... Here, in 2002 we are urging people to stop using or misusing our main weapon. With this weapon we are forcing the enemy (germs) to find a way to be strong and powerful. We are creating a situation in which we are becoming once again terrorized by the threat of plagues.

I am an earthling , so I'll come from that angle. Indifference still applies. In 1902, earth enjoyed much of it's natural beauty. The skies, lands and oceans were virtually without blemish. Sure there were townships brought about with the detstruction of trees. Pollution came from new forms of transportation. The oceans were offended by voyages to and fro. In 2002, we have trees falling down and neighborhoods popping up everyday. To me, as a child the smell of pines trees was a pleasant reminder of Earth's wonders. Today, the smell of pine trees makes me look around to find the area being gutted and leaves me depressed for a moment. And a short moment it is because I still enjoy my house in my community that use to be some other living creatures home.

I live in 2002, so I'll come from that angle. I am a black, female, single mother of bi-racial children. There is no indifference when I tell you ... Thank goodness I am living now rather than then.

===message:Is the world perfect? No. Will we ever have utopia? No.  But the question is, are we better off today than a hundred years ago? Yes.  Opportunities, medical advancements, and technology are three of the many examples. One hundred years ago minorities took the back seat: women could not vote and blacks were segregated.  Today, there are many doors that have been opened for minorities in schools and  occupations.  But the biggest improvement is the opportunity to make a change.  Any and everyone can voice their opinion and fight oppression.  Anyone can create opportunities to make a change, whether it is in the legal system, in congress, or in petitions.  One hundred years ago people did not live as long. Medical advancements have eliminated many diseases and can treat many more. Technology has brought comforts and conveniences to our lives that one hundred years ago many couldn't begin to imagine.  We still have a long way to go to get closer to perfection.  But the truth of the matter is, we have the ability to make a change, live more comfortably and live longer lives because of all of these advancements.  There are things that were better 100 years ago than today, such as pollution, population control, and family structure.  However, I wouldn’t change the advancements of today for them.

===message:People’s lives today are better than people’s lives were one hundred years ago if you take into consideration the major changes in technologies and the major advances in medical science.  Today technology is a part of people’s work environments and technology is a part of people’s home environments. Changes in the forms of technology used in the work place have increased productivity and in many cases reduced the amount of time that people have to spend at the work place thereby giving people more leisure time. Advances in medical science have made it possible to perform some operations with lasers which in a lot of cases causes less discomfort for the patient and also requires less time to recuperate. Because of the advances in medical science people are living healthier and longer lives. It is true that some of the changes that we have seen are not all for the best.  In the endless pursuit of progress we have not been very good stewards towards our planet earth. Every time I see  new construction  beginning and all the trees being cut down I wonder if the shopping center , office building, roadways,  or airport runways are really that necessary. I wonder if anyone on the metropolitan planning commission  has noticed that the summers are getting hotter and that  there is little rain , and maybe there is a connection between cutting down all the trees and replacing them with concrete buildings and pavement. Maybe there is a connection between cutting down the trees and an increase in asthma cases even though steps are being taken to try to clean up the air.

===message:Peoples lives today are definately better than they were a hundred years ago.  The average life span is constantly rising due from medical explorations to cure diseases and other harmful things to humans.  Transportation has given people the opportunity to make more money by being able to move easy and relocate to find better jobs and the needs for their families.  Education is always progressing each year.  More and more people are attending colleges.  The richer countries are helping to support the poorer countries from starvation and medical supplies.

===message:I feel that we are much better off today than we were 100 years ago. The fight for women’s equality has already been won and that was a major obstacle women had to overcome 100 years ago. The technology that was emerging 100 years ago was fascinating to the people of that time. However, it obviously is nothing compared to the technology that our country possesses today. This lack of modern technology would have made life 100 years ago very different. There are many more opportunities today than there were 100 years ago for a wider range of people. We still have social distinction today, although not to the degree that it existed 100 years ago. Americans today still suffer from the pressure of protecting the country from other radical nations. It seems that we as a country have always had to deal with a threat from another country. The threats today are much different than the threats of 100 years ago. In 1914, people were nervous about the beginning of World War I, which is a much larger scale conflict than we deal with today. Presently, people are worried about conflicts with Iraq and other smaller countries. Today’s conflicts are on a much smaller scale, but still have the same possibility of mass destruction.
