===subject:Another Perspective on War
===message:I agree with the soldiers in “All Quiet on the Western Front” to some degree as to how the war started. However, allow me to offer a different perspective. Early in 1915 when the first phase of the war still seemed new, Sigmund Freud published an article titled “Thoughts for the Times on War and Death.” The paper was full of wisdom, but it may have been too wise to be popular among its readers. It began by describing the disillusionment felt by so many people upon their discovery of the cruelty and brutality of which previously civilized nations and individuals were capable. Why had the war occurred? A dozen times before 1914, general war had seemed to be imminent, but it had not begun. It’s true that the need to satisfy Germany’s “legitimate claims” to African colonies had been growing. And a valid point can be made about the growing impatience of all the combatants. Yet Freud offered two other causes that should be noted. One was that men need war to work off the intolerable burden of civilization. The alternative to war is neurosis, both individual and group, which itself can become intolerably destructive. People cannot go on indefinitely acting as if they are civilized. They must be allowed an outlet for their murderous deeper desires. War, in this interpretation, is an irresistible, although dangerous, temptation. Men feel drawn to it and always have felt this way throughout history. The second reason Freud provided was simply boredom. It has been suggested that one explanation for the fall of the Roman Empire during the fifth century A.D. was boredom too. The empire had endured for 500 years, but its problems had never been solved. It had not found an effective way to choose a ruler, and almost all of its emperors had been monsters. The rich became richer, the poor poorer, yet the rich were no happier than the poor. Therefore, when the barbarians came, as the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy wrote, “At least they were some kind of solution.” And in Europe, the ruling classes together with the capitalists and businessmen, acted as if they were terribly bored. Money bored them, but worse, so did peace. Finally, they could not endure the boredom any longer and allowed the war to begin. However, no one expected the war to be so terrible or last so long. In the end, everyone wished the war had never started, but it began because enough people wanted it to.

===message:I think wars happen for obvious reasons. A war occurs for the same reasons that two neighbors might argue over their property line. Throughout history, most wars happen due to attempts by one county to conquest additional territory. The soldiers in “Al Quiet on the Western Front” examined war in its most elementary nature. While their sentiments are humorous, they do not examine any social or political struggles that war settles. I think, of the three ideas given in the question, that peaceful negotiation is the only that can prevent some wars form happening. For example, negotiation prevented an almost certain nuclear exchange between the U.S. and Russia in the sixties. However, adopting a stance of pacifism will not turn away any aggressor. Disarmament is, in my opinion, only an effort to ease the minds of opposing powers and will not negate a war. In addition, wars of modern times cannot even be averted by negotiation due to religious differences. The common denominator in all negotiations is the value for human life. When one side has no value for human life, such as the Islamic fundamentalists or the Nazis, negotiation is impossible. In this case, war is the only course of action that can be taken.

===message:I believe wars happen because one leader wants to forcefully take control of a place or resource that belongs to another country. When this happens, other countries either feel the need to come to the attacked countries side or to join with the attacker. So, when these countries take their sides, it causes there to be conflict. If the attacked country decides not to hand over whatever it is that the attacker wants, the attacker feels the need to forcefully take it with the help of its allies. Of course, the attacked country, along with its allies, will retaliate. Yes, I do agree with the way the soldiers expained the cause of war. The first soldier explains it with the same explanation I would. Someone will always become offended when their advance to take something is rejected. In some cases I do believe that pacificism, disarmament, or peaceful negotiations may prevent some wars from happening, but in no way I am disillusioned to believe that it will prevent wars from ever happening again. There are people in the world that will not be happy until they control everything, we cannot pacify or negotiate with these people. I believe that war is something that comes with our freedom. I believe that war will always be a threat, especially to the USA.

===message:I agree with what the soldiers are saying. Back then, most of the countries where made up of peasents or workers. They just wanted to work and make a honest living for themselves. It was the leaders that wanted more. I think wars happened back then because one country was always jealous of the other and wanted more. More back then was pretty much land. Today war happens for the same reason but in a different way. Today it is not so much a fight over land as it is a fight over beliefs. WWI and WWII we pretty much had to get involved in. I totally don't agree with us getting involved in the Korean or Vietnam War. I feel like if there is an inter struggle between the people -they should handle it. I realize we got involved then because of humanitarian reasons. Still, 1000s of our own soldiers where killed and for what? We did not really accomplish anything for all the lives we lost.  I feel the same about the Middle East. We should only get involved if we are threatened in some way such as the Sept 11th incident.  If not, let them fight each other. I know we also are trying to help those people over there.  I understand that the US thinks it can save the world. I still feel like we should start saving ourselves sometimes first though.  I don’t think that we can ever get rid of war completely. People have this need to control and as long as there is that there will be disagreements. We also have so many different beliefs. This also starts wars. I don’t think at least I hope there will never be another World War because we all know what will happen then.

I would suggest, though I am biased, that Palestinians and Islamic extremists should devote the conviction that they have to the betterment of their own regions instead of lashing out at us. Any attempt that the United States has made to intervene abroad since becoming a world power has been in the interest of an oppressed people or nation. Not once have we used our efforts to conquest land or occupy territories indefinitely when easily we could have and been successful. The world looks upon us to be the international police of peace and when we oblige we receive terrorist acts and a lack of support in return. It must be nice to be on the sidelines as a neutral spectator as many of the groups are who brand us negatively. Sometimes war is necessary to ensure the liberty of people everywhere. And while I agree that we sometimes get in over our heads (i.e. Vietnam), who will stand up if we don’t. I cannot agree with the shallow statements of the soldiers in "All Quiet on the Western Front" because I love my country, because I believe in the leaders that I voted into office, because I would stand firm with my government if it deemed it necessary to engage in a conflict, and because the preservation of our constitution and freedom are worth fighting a war for.......................................And now......I will step down from my soapbox.

===message:I believe wars happen because the need, want, and desire for power.  With power an individual can do remotely anything.  Power comes in all forms, from bosses having power over their employees, to parents having power over their kids, to governments having power over countries’.  Wars are fought over different powers of countries trying to become more powerful than they already are.  An example of today would be the Middle East wars, all because of some land, countries want to become more powerful.  Hitler, power, WWI power, Pearl Harbor, Japan wanted us to see their power.  War’s foundation is built off of the need for power.  I agree with the soldiers to an extent in All Quiet on the Western Front.  Many innocent men were killed and died not knowing the real reason behind the war except that their country made them fight for some cause.  However, patriotism runs through my blood and if my country needed me to fight, not only would I know why, but I would proudly back my nation in the decision to go to war.  Many men and women have died fighting for MY right therefore I would be gladly to serve and protect the younger generations of this nation.  Absolutely not!  Pacifism, disarmament, or peaceful negotiations will never prevent war.  We already have evidence, WWII, but in my opinion, your voice will only be heard so loud.  No voice of pacifism will ever get to the heart of all of the countries in this world.  No country will allow itself to become venerable by disarmament.  No country would give up their army, guns, etc, because of the lack of trust in the other nations.  I mean, would you trust a drunken man with your kids?  Would you take Hitler’s word?  It is a good idea, but too unfathomable.

===message:There are different reasons for the cause of a war depending on the situation. There may be three main explanations for the creation of a war.  For instance, many times wars are declared without the input of the people of that nation. This means that not only are the people excluded in deciding whether or not they want to risk their lives and the lives of their loved ones, but it also shows that the destiny of many people are decided by only a few.  As a result the three main reasons for war are greed, supremacy, and defense.  Wars are often declared and fought in order for that leader/nation to gain more supremacy over other peoples or nations.  Also wars are started for defensive purposes when security is threatened.  I agree with the soldiers from “All Quiet on the Western Front” to a certain extent.  There reasons for the cause of war are based from their points of view as soldiers.  These reasons are justified however, I don’t believe they are the only reasons for the start of wars.  Finally, there is no formula for ending or preventing all wars it is simply a fact of life which has been occurring since the beginning of mankind.

Sometimes leaders make good decisions (such as G.W. Bush wanting to go after Sadam Hussain in order to protect America from total destruction), while other leaders (the more corrupt ones) tend to go to war all for the cause of selfish gain, like Hitler’s invasions into the smaller countries surrounding Germany. Even when the "good guy" is the one who initiates the war, one can bet that the underlying cause is some prideful dictator in a far away country. If pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiation could exist in a perfect state and if all the countries of the world could agree on these three policies, then the world would have fewer problems. But, we must think realistically and recognize the harsh realities of the world in which we live.

===message:Why do you think wars happen?  I believe there are three prime causes for war: economics, in the name of an "ism" (religion, nationalism, tribalism, etc.), and egomaniacal leadership.  Economics simply means one nation wanting an asset like land that another sovereign nation owns (Mexican-American War).  "Isms" occur do to a form of “patriotic” fervor.  For instance religion includes the Crusades and Jihad.  Nationalism includes the Hungarian Revolt against the Soviets in 1957.  Tribalism is some of the infighting in Africa where the Europeans failed to divide boundaries according to tribal locale.  Egomaniacal leaders like Pol Pot and Amin massacred millions in wars against people living within their boundaries.  Some of these wars cross all three potential causes.  

Do you agree with how the soldiers in All Quiet on the Western Front explained the causes of war?  I agree especially as I observe the President and the Congress debate war in Iraq.  These men will not be on the front lines of urban guerrilla warfare in Baghdad that could lead to soldiers on both sides being cannon fodder.  I can picture the author Remarque writing a similar novel called All’s Quiet on the Mid East Front with American troops in occupied Iraq and Afghanistan debating the causes of war while the leadership parties in DC.

In your opinion, can pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiation prevent wars from ever happening again? 
I did a cursory look on the Net and concluded that at least since I was born in 1979 there has been no tear without some form of a hot conflict on the earth.  Though there are allegedly Pax periods like when the Romans and the British ruled, I doubt very much there is one year since recorded history that has not had armed conflict between nations, city-states, or tribes.  Based on history’s lesson, peaceful negotiation can prevent a particular war, but does not always succeed so that war seems inevitable as no sovereign nation or even militia groups are willing to fully disarm.  The US just tore up one nuclear weapon control treaty.

===message:The answers that the soldiers gave for the reasons for war in "All Quiet on the Western Front" were naive but true.  The reasons they gave were ambigious in their meanings.  In reality, a country (the actual land) can't offend another country.  The leaders of a nation and it's governments policies towards another nation, could offend the leader, government, and people of another nation.  When I think of why wars happen, I can only think of human beings.  We are the reason and only reason wars happen.  We fight the wars in name of religion.  Our governments commision wars in the name of "fighting the war on terrorism".  We, human beings, are the terrorist.  We manufacture the weapons of mass destruction that our government is now trying to remove from certain nations through war.  When I use the term "we" I mean people not the United States of America.  Yes it is true one can not control the actions of others, but we have control over our own actions.  We as current and future parents have a say in how the future citizens and world leaders of tomorrow view war.  We also have a say in how these future citizens learn how to resolve problems with each other.  It is a widely accepted idea that violence is the last resort to solving problems.  War is simply implementing this idea in foreign policy.  Pacifism, disarment, and peaceful negotiation will not work unless all people are willing to accept these principles.

When military leaders take the place of diplomats and military leaders see the world in military terms only.  In Remarque’s novel, All Quiet on the Western Front, the soldiers in conversation are really not sure why they are fighting.  They themselves are not offended, but recognize that the rulers are the ones offended.  I agree and relate to these soldiers since these people were not consulted before they were thrust into World War I.  I believe that every person should have a clear understanding of what the war is about before he or she makes a conscience decision whether to fight or not.   Do you agree?  Pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiation are wonderful tools to prevent wars, but they are only as good as the people behind them.  Consequently, I do not believe that all people living on this earth have the will and desire to prevent wars.  For example, look at the issues we have with Iraq.  This emphasizes the fact that people cannot seem to work their problems out in a peaceful way.

===message:Why do wars happen?  Well there is not one simple reason to answer this question.  There could be one reason or a combination of many reasons for a war to happen.  One reason could be personal reasons.  In my opinion, World War II started because of personal reasons with Adolf Hitler, he wanted power.  I think a part of President Bush's problem with Saddam Hussein is personal.  Don't miss understand me and think that I believe we should leave him alone, because I don't, but I do think that part of the problem is personal.  Another reason could be cultural reasons such as African tribes fighting each other.  Another example of wars started because of cultural reasons would be the different tribes of American Indians fighting each other.  Another reason for wars could be economical reasons such as the American Revoultion.  England was placing taxes on all our goods, but we had no representation in Parliament.  Desert Storm waa also based on economic factors.  We had to help and protect Saudi Arabia and our oil supply.  I think the strongest and most used reason for war is religion.  Historically, religion has been a predominate reason for wars.  Some examples are Isreal and the PLO, Britain and Ireland (IRA) and India and Pakistan.  The exception to this is the wars in which the United States have been involved in and those wars were cultural and economic.  I do not believe that pacifism, disarmament and peaceful negotiation can prevent wars from happening.  The reason is , there is always going to be that one person or country that wants war, kinda like the school yard bully, who wants to fight.

===message:War happens because of a variety of reasons, which include the quest for power, control, intimidation, hate, jealousy, religious beliefs (fanaticism).  The gulf war was fought in 1991 because Iraq occupied Kuwait and refused to leave.  The Iraqi president said that Kuwait belonged to Iraq.  They did this because Kuwait is a small country that has a lot of oil resources, and instead of paying Kuwait back the money Iraq borrowed from them to fight the War with Iran, they decided to intimidate, show power, and annex Kuwait. Of course countries like the USA that have economic interests in Kuwait would not stand by and watch, hence the golf war.  This is just an aspect of a cause of war.  The whole world is fighting the war on terrorism right now because of religious fanatics who hate people that are not in the same faith with them.  As such they commit acts of terror.  They blow people up, blow themselves up believing they’ll go to their “heaven” when they die in the act. They are jealous of the western world, and their achievements.  Anybody that is not Moslem is an Infidel, a great Satan, an enemy, and that is why they believe they are fighting Jihad war.  Yes, I agree with the accounts of the soldiers in all quiet on the western front.  Their account is based on their experiences, and how they understood what was going on at that time.  Pacificism, disarmament, and peace negotiation cannot prevent war from happening.  For as long as we have people like Saddam Hussein who can be compared with Hitler in certain aspects, who does not obey United Nations resolutions, is a dictator, builds arms of mass destruction, and does not pay attention or listen to reason, there will always be war; someone from somewhere would come forward to contain him.  For as long as we have people who fight the jihad war scattered all over the world committing terrorist acts, there will always be war; as long as a nation continues to bear grudges against another nation because of occupation, there will always be war; and for as long as people don’t want peace negotiation until their demands are met, there will always be war.

As a result of them not liking what we stand for they do something to devastate our country hence Sept. 11th happened. So now our country might be going to war because we need to defend ourselves so that hopefully this does not happen again. In Remarque's, All Quiet on the Western Front, the soliders talk about their ideas of why they are at war but none of them really know why and are confused to if they want to be there or not. I believe this is true in many cases of war. People just go to fight because they are sent to and not really having a clear understanding of why. So yes I do agree with Remarque's, All Quiet on the Western Front. I don't think any thing can prevent war from happening because everyone has their own view on issues and  want things to go their way or no way.

===message:I believe wars happen when any one or more leaders want to control more than their own territories. What's more, I belive that when one leader feels that his rule is superior to all others, this is also when the conflict begins to take shape. Also, in the same instance, when a leader believes that one country may have possession of land that is very valuable and they begin want to reap the benefits of the land as well, they may become obsessed at having it. Causing yet another conflict. I believe that the soldiers in All Quiet on the Western Front explained war correctly. Although their explaination was quite simple, it was very acurate. As I have stated above, if there is one leader attempting to take control, just as Adolf Hitler did with his attempt at "Purifying" the world, there is bound to be a country, or better stated "Leader", who will become offended. When a country is under attack from another country, there will be other nations and countries who will either side with the antagonist or the protagonist and this is, in actuality, what creates an opportunity for a war. In my opinion, pacifying a nation or country is an unreal solution to preventing the reoccurance of future wars. When you pacify a leader, it is much like pacifying a child. When an infant cries and a person sticks a pacifier in his or her mouth, then everytime that child cries he or she will expect that pacifier. Whenever a country begins pacifying another, that country will feel that whatever they want, they will receive. So, no, I do not believe that pacifying a country will ever solve the threat of a future war. Disarming a country will work for a short time, but just like young adults, when someone really wants a weapon, they will get one. If a country wants to arm itself, it will. I am certain that disarming a country makes everyone else feel very safe, but the reality is: No one can guard them 24/7 to make sure they don't illegally arm themselves. So, once again, no I do not believe disarming a country will prevent the future reoccurance of war. I believe it may work for a few years, but only until that country becomes restless of not having arms. When I think of peaceful negotiations, I think of Suddam Hussein. As I recall, we were in a similar position a few years ago with the Persian Gulf War. Because we thought we could negotiate peacefully with Hussein, the American Government allowed him to live. Now here we are years later, involved in yet another war and who has his hands in this conflict? None other than Suddam Hussein. I believe it is easy for a leader to sit at a table with other leaders in the world, especially when they are broken and defeated, and agree to anything. The problem is: What happens in the future? I wonder if the government had decided to execute Hussien, if we would even be in this predicament. As, I watched the USA original series "Dead Zone", I learned from one episode that every action has a reaction. Since he could see into the future, John Smith knew what would happen with each action. It is impossible for us to say whether we would be here again if Suddam had be killed, but it is a very interesting question. I know that we are in this war because we were attacked as Americans, but what are we going to do with the leaders who have harbored these terrorists? Are we going to peacefully negotiate with them? A negotiation, to me, is just a way for a broken and beaten country to pull out of either a threat or a present war. For this reason, I believe that negotiations will only work for the years it will take for the beaten country to rebuild its military. No, negotiations won't prevent future wars, because negotiations only buy time.

Pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiations cannot prevent wars from ever happening again.  People protesting war, disarming countries of the weapons, and peace talks are nice attempts to work towards a resolution, however, that's just what they are...attempts towards peace.  The bottom line is that people can protest war all they want, countries can say they have rid themselves of arms, but they always stash some away for a rainy day(just in case).  Hitler proved that with the invasion of Prague.  Countries, whether they sign peace treaties or not, have gone back on thier word since before WWI began.

===message:In my view war happens for numerous reasons. The first reasson being that on leader imparticular wants to control more land or people than he already controls.  War can also happen because of religious beliefs, this is shown by our current "War on Terrorism" the religous beliefs of the Bin Laden and his followers led them to fly those planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  There is a combination of these 2 reasons with the war Isreal.  Yes, the leaders want control over more territory but religion plays a large part in the disruption.  Wars are also caused from time to time because one government "sticks its nose in where it doesn't belong."  The United States is notorious for this.  We are always trying to fix problems that other countries are having.  Yes we are a dominant world power but that doesn't mean we have to fix the problems everyone else is having.  I do agree with the soldiers, many of them didn't have the slightest clue of why the were fighting or maybe better said what they were fighting for.  Even though everyone can't be in agreement on everything I realize that but to at least let the soldiers know why they were risking their lives was the least that could have been done.  There are always going to be wars, nothing will pacify everyone, disarmerment will only be a temporary fix and peaceful negotations are pointless.  If you do something to pacify one country or leader you will only end up making another one mad.  Disarmerment is great but how can you ever be sure you have disarmed a country.  Weapons can alway be hid and even if they aren't countries will become uncomfortable being without weapons and will eventually start to make them again. If for no other reason the human way of competition.  Peaceful negoations often works like pacification.  You negoate with one country only to turn around and find you've started a problem with another country.  Negoation also allows the enemy more time to prepare for war.  Simply put these techniques are only a way to avoid war for a short period of time but it will happen at some point anyway.

===message:I believe that the causes of wars are greed, jealousy, power, and miscommunication.  Some countries want to have all the power.  They don’t want to share the their power with other countries.   Look at what’s going on right now with President Bush.  It’s not about Saddam Hussein; it’s about taking over his oil tanks to gain complete control over the oil industry.  I agree on some of the soldiers’ explanations because sometimes the leaders put the blame on the citizens instead of themselves.  How can it be on the citizens, if they have no idea why they have issues with the other countrymen?  In my opinion, pacifism, disarmament, and peaceful negotiation can prevent war if everyone, including the citizens and rulers, believes those ideas.  That's like saying all human beings are perfect which we all know is not true.

===message:Why do wars happen?  There is no definate answer to that question.  We may ask why do children fight or why do married/dating couples argue.  There are several different reasons, some are silly and ridiculous while others are serious.  I believe this is the same for warfare.  We are now in a time of greed and selfishness.  Leaders want control and power.  Wars occur because someone is trying "to prove something."  Bin Laden was trying to prove that Americans can be brought down and hurt.  With the case of Bin Laden, religious and ethical beliefs came into play.  Wars become larger and more deadly when other countries become involved just to get into good graces with a country involved.  Wars continue to occur because leaders keep pushing to "gain more ground."  The soldiers on All Quiet on the Western Front said that wars occur because "one country offends another country ... or people offend other people."  I do believe this to be true.  It is not the only cause of war, but it definately is a contributing factor.  Disarmament will never prevent wars from occuring because no country will give up arms first.  Another reason that this will not work is because individuals would find other resources to harm one another.  Take the case of Bin Laden:  he used our own airplanes to cause harm to Americans.  Then there is chemical warfare.  Disarmming a person will not prevent wars from occuring.  Peaceful negotiations will never work because someone will never quite be satisfied.  Pacifism will not work because there is to much anger in the world today.  To many individuals want to fight and others cannot keep their noses out of the situation.  I don't believe that there is a cure for preventing wars.  I just hope that something can be thought of to lessen the amount of war and destruction going on in our society today.

===message:When considering this question, I went back and reread the beginning of Chapter 3, which spoke of All Quiet on the Western Front.  The one passage that really got me to thinking was when the young soldier asked, “Then what is war for?” Another young soldier growls “The best thing is to not talk about the rotten business,” and the other solder agrees, “It won’t make any difference, that’s sure.”

Sadly enough most soldiers in the war did not understand the causes, but had no options but to fight.  After imagining the thoughts that these soldiers contemplate while on the front lines, there is really no exact answer as to why wars happen. Maybe my best answer would be dominance over all other nations. But at what cost?  The young soldiers explain the war as one country offending another.  Basically this is a competition for world dominance as I see it.  

In a perfect world there would not be a concern for future wars.  Definitely the United States in a dominant power.  There will always be other nations competing for this role.  With the increase technology and weapon production, the future is not going in the direction of world peace.  Even worse, we have to deal with the wars going on within our own nations and strikes against our own people.

===message:Wars  have happened  because  of various reasons and causes  since the beginning of time. One reason for a war could be a disagreement between two nations about some ideal, or one nation desires to add more land to their territory, while another nation might want more power. The soldiers in All Quiet on the Western Front  did touch on some of the truth of why they were fighting a war, because the leaders or rulers of the nations involved in a war against one another have failed to peacefully resolve the existing problem. I do not think disarmament is a solution because I do not think there is one nation that can be trusted to completely disarm themselves. Do you want to live in a nation that has disposed of all its arms and sit around hoping that all the other nations will be true to their word and dispose of their arms too? The only way that pacifism would work is if all nations adopted this way of life. The trouble with  peaceful negotiation is again the trust factor because it seems that history has shown us over and over again that not everyone abides by the rules spelled out in these peaceful negotiations.

===message:Wars happen for various reasons. Throughout history many wars have been started simply because a kingdom, country or group of people wanted to have more power by owning what others have. To get this they took by force which meant war. Other wars have started because people of a country or group feel threatened by economic, political, religeous or racial inequality. When these people become severely oppressed or percieve themselves to be at an extreme disadvantage compared to others around them, and become desperate enough, they become willing to do whatever it takes to ease their seemingly hopeless condition. The mass of people in general do not want war. However, when a charismatic leader, that either wants war or believes war is the only solution, appeals to the emotions of the aforementioned people, he can lead them (often blindly) into a war. We have seen this happen several times in the last century over economic situations. The major wars of the century were started this way. Still numerous smaller wars were fought because of religeous and racial conflicts.

The soldiers in "All Quiet on the Western Front" tried to explain the war in simplistic terms. The reasons for war are seldom ever simple especially at the time. Usually after the war is over the reason it was started is easier to define and it is easier to see how the war could have been avoided. Hindsight is always 20-20. The soldiers in the film were caught up in the confusion of politics, patriotism and moral conviction, as are most soldiers fighting in a war. They were trying to make sense of it all. The fact is war never makes sense when we stop and look at it. There is always a peaceful solution if people would reason together. But people are not always reasonable, they do not always try to see others point of view and are not always willing to sacrifice some in order to maintain peace. For this reason pacifism, disarmament and peaceful negotiation will not always prevent wars from happening. As the world moves toward global interrelatedness mabe we will understand each other better and will avoid many potential wars. Still there will be people that start wars and people that will fight wars to defend themselves.

===message:In my opinion war is definitely inevitable.  As long as there are “war heads” that have this greed for excess amounts of land, resources, and power in general, there will always be war.  Whether it’s a religious war, a war over territory, or gaining others resources, it all boils down to power.  I do agree with the soldiers and their reasons for the causes of war.  It is mainly those in power (the wealthier class), who have offended another country, not the general people.  When soldiers are fighting these wars, they are usually fighting for the stupidity or ignorance of wealthy, egotistical, power-seeking men.  Those soldiers did not even know the reasons they were at war.  It’s sad to say, but this is the case for many wars that have come about.  I also think that pacifying a country, or a people is not the route to take, simply because it disables them to see after matters themselves.  You always end up making unnecessary enemies.  Disarmament seems like a good idea from a moral standpoint, but realistically disarmament would be devastating to anyone’s economy, as well as causing total chaos.  Weapons can find themselves in any country, and smuggling them in or creating a black market for them would be inevitable.  I think that all negotiations are attempted peacefully in the end does it ever really end war or just postpone it. In fact most of the peaceful negotiation attempts I can recall usually end up leading to war.

===message:Wars happen because at some points in history leaders of some countries have significant disageements. These countries may have different economic ideals, religious ideals, or anything that brings about conflict. When this occurs, the leaders of these countries must find a way to compromise and avoid military conflict. When these leaders fail, war is inevitable. I agree with the outlook of the soldiers because war can involve people from different nations that do not know anything about each other. I do not feel war can be prevented by any means. Steps can be taken to limit the probability of war but war is inevitable at times.
