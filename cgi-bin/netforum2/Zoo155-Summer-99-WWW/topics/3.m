===message:Hi.  My name is Ann.  I'm currently entering the summer between my freshman and sophmore year at Iowa State University. Graphic design is my major.  My home town is Cedar Falls, IA.  The reason for taking this class is just because it sounded interesting and something that I wanted to know about for my own knowledge. I'm also very excited to take a class over the web.  I'm not sure what would be unusual about me, but I think my Mom might say it's unusual that I sit at the kitchen table to draw her pots and pans as a still-life, just for fun! :) Have a great day! I look forward to talking with people from this class.

It's a good thing that this class is so flexible in its schedule since I'll be missing a week at the end of June to go bicycling in Colorado.  In fact, one of my biking buddies is the Chief of Surgery at Mary Greeley.  He's been my prime motivation for taking this class since he refuses to treat my like a layman when discussing medical issues.  Since he won't talk down to my level I've decided that I'd better train myself to speak at his!

I have a minor in Speech, which happens to be the second class I am taking - 212 Public Speaking.  Exciting I know!  Anyway, I took this course because I thought it was interesting in high school so why not try it here.  I can't think of anything too unique about me except that I love to make people smile.  I like to have fun and hang out with my friends.  Well, I guess that's about it.  I look forward to talking to everyone, See ya later!

So I decided to stick around for another year and take some secondary education classes.  I am also taking classes like this one for a coaching certification.

I am glad to be taking this class over the web.  We live 45 minutes from campus, and it is a pain driving in all the time.  My husband and I are also starting up a home business, and we have been pretty busy with that as well!  :)

However, I think that the most unusual thing about me right now, is the fact that my best friend is currently on the road, playing shows for Ozzfest crowds.  Thanks for reading!  Angela

My name is Melissa Underhill-Lee.  I am most likely the most recent person to register for this class.  I have a B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&M University.  I graduated with my Master's degree in 1990. My home town is Grand Rapids, Minnesota (don't look too closely, there aren't really any rapids there anymore!). I live in Seattle and currently work for a large aircraft company.

I am taking this class for two reasons:  It will satisfy one of the pre-requisites I need to go back to school and study Physical Therapy, and it comes in handy in my classes.

My classes are probably a good thing to call unusual about me....I am the only Aerospace Engineer I know who also teaches group exercise classes.  I currently teach Step Aerobics and Body Pump (a one hour weight training class), although I also teach the Reebok Slide, High and Low Impact aerobics on the floor, ans stretching techniques.  The information I learn from this class will be put to good use in my work with clients even if I never get in to PT school.

Wish me luck...I'll need it since I registered 2 weeks late!
