===more:My name is Brenda Matsen.  I'm from Fort Dodge and probably 
the oldest person taking this class.  I'm a junior in the 
BLS program and I've chosen this internet class because I 
work full-time and I'm a full-time mom. This will let me 
work on assignments at midnight!  I don't have time to 
be unusual
