===message:I was wondering what triggered you to make this career move? Have you always wanted to do this, or had you been sure engineering was the way to go?  I ask this because I am studying engineering right now and don't think I want to work in industry. I chose this field because I have been told it will be a good education and I could easily do something completely different.  If you have time to let me know your opinion on the field that would be great. Thanks.
