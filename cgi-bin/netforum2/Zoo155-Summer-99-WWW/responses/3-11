===message:Hi, I hope you're summer is going well.  I'm taking this course for the same reason, so I can take it at home.  I'm only a freshman, but I'm thinking about changing my major to education, coaching sounds really fun too, since I like sports.  Have a great summer.

I'm taking this class for the same reason of it being more convient for me with working at Principal Financial, coaching gymnastics and usering at the Iowa Cubs games.  I hope you have a good summer and good luck in this class!
