===message:Wow, I can't believe that you have time on your hands to take this class with all those young ones.  I have a daughter that will be 3 in August and I think I have it bad.  I am sure glad that it is you and not me because I couldn't handle it.  Your children, hopefully, are very good and don't get into much. Mine on the other hand is too active and stays up very late.Goodluck!!!

===message:Hello.  As you know, for this class we are supposed to post a reply to someone and your message caught my eye because of your anthropology major.  Last year was my first year and second semester I did a research project with Dr. Steadman.  It was fascinating and I liked playing with the bones so I decided to declare an anthro major.  I'm very impressed that you manage both school and a family.  I can barely manage to keep myself on task.  Hope you're enjoying the summer.
