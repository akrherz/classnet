===message:Hi, Brenda

This is my first internet course too. I hope it'll be fun and exciting. I really admire the way you handle your busy life, two full-time jobs and taking classes?, wow...it must be very tough. I have a friend who has two small children and is a full-time student. She always tells me how hard it is to take of the family and worry about school at the same time. Well, I hope you'll enjoy this class and learn as much as you expect to.

===message:Hey Brenda, sounds like you are keeping busy.  I've been to Fort D. a couple of times but only to pass through.  I have an older bro that lives in Humboldt and like a good little sis I drive up and visit him.  Best of luck with zoology!

That is amazing.  It is so admirable that you can jugle all these things at one time.  I hope that you are able to get some rest amongst the hustle of daily life!
