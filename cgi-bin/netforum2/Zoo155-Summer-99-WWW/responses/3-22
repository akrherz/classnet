===message:We have a few things in common - I'm from Wellsburg, not too far from Marshalltown.  I like doing this over the internet too because it's convenient to do it whenever you want to.  I took Music 102 last fall - did you like it?  I liked some parts of it, at least I didn't do too bad in the class!  Maybe I'll talk to you again sometime!
