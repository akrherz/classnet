===message:Thanks for not lumping me into the ladies section of your introduction! Of course I am not really in the class, I am tech support, so you are still the only guy taking the class as of now! I am 3 credits from graduating in Environmental Engineering (I will graduate in August) and I am used to classes full of guys with one or two women. Of course that really doesn't make a difference and especially not in a web-course. Good luck learning the Chief of Surgery language...that is a summer project! Maybe he can help you study that week in June when
you are cycling!

===message:Brian, 
     Your trip sounds cool.  I will be going on a biking trip across Maine in two weeks.  Is this your first trip?  Sounds like it will be a lot of fun as well as educational:) Good luck with learning all the medical lingo!
