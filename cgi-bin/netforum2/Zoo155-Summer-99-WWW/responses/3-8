First of all, I think your name is pretty cool.  I'm sure you've probably heard one thing or another about it all of your life, but hey you've got an original name, I like it.  When I signed up for this class, I thought that I would be online with a lot of people whom I could pass on the street later in the day.  I didn't even think about someone from out of the state possibly being in my class.  Maine looks like a pretty peaceful place.  Mellow and laid back.  I could be wrong, I've already been caught thinking narrowly today, haven't I?  Well, I won't bore you anymore with my trivialities, I'm off!  ~Angela~:)

===message:Hi Sage-Wow, I can't believe that you graduated from SLU.  I grew up in St. Louis and I just recently moved to Iowa.  I know I must be stupid, but Iowa State is giving me a good education -- so I can't complain.  I would love to hear about lfe as a Billikin, but we have a game tomorrow and I have to be at the stadium at 8 a.m.Good Luck this year!Erin
