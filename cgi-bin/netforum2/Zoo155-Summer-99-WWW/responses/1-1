===message:Hi, my name is Erin Hiscox and I am in the Zool 155.  I still have some unanswered questions, or maybe I am not looking in the right place.  On one of the announcements you were talking about a homepage.  Where is it?  Also, someone told me to look at the FAQ's on class net.  All it is is an email form.  I still have not purchased a text.  I don't even know if we are using a text.  Also, what is the time line for quizzes and assignments and exams.  One last question, how do I go about getting a proctor for my exams.  I will be doing the web corresponding at night due to my very demanding job?  Could you please help me??????Thank you for your time.  I am sorry to bother you!Erin Hiscoxerinhiscox@webtv.net
