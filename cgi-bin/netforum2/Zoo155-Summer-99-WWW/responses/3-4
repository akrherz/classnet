===message:Hi Linn! I'm a senior too! When do you graduate? I have 3 semesters left. I haven't a clue about what type of job I'd like to do when I graduate. Are you planning on teaching zoology? I have a friend who's majoring in zoo sec. ed. His name is Andy Pelham, wouldn't happen to know him, would you? Anyways, hope this class is going well for you. Talk to you later.
