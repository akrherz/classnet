===message:Hey, Ann from Cedar Falls!  Brian, here.  Seeing as how you're the first to post a message, you seemed the obvious choice of person to whom I should reply.  Graphic design, huh?  One of my best friends was a graphic design major.  I never had the skills to take any design classes, although I've always wanted to take the Art History classes (280/281, I think?)  I probably won't, though, since the book is WAY too expensive and I've heard the slide presentations are pretty boring.  

I hope we aren't supposed to be talking about anatomy right now since I've only listened to lecture #1 so far and don't have that much to discuss.  Besides, I just took some cough medicine a little while ago and my eyes are starting to twitch so I'd better say au revoir!

===message:Hello Ann!  I just started to figure this whole internet thing out so bear with me.  Is this your first web course?  It is mine.  Something new but it makes me a little nervous about what exactly is going on.  So your major is Graphic Design?  My rooommate is in Interior Design, if that even matters.  That's really cool that you knew what you were going to do when you were a freshman because a lot of people get stuck.  I've always wanted to teach ever since I can remember, so hopefully it's a straight shot to graduation for me.  Well, that's it, I guess I'll be keeping in touch for the next how many weeks.  See ya!
