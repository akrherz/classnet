		1. Brain expansion

 
IV. Origin of neural crest cells
	A. Chick / quail culture experiments
	—Think about these questions before class on Wednesday-
		1. What outcomes are possible?
		2. What must you know to distinguish these
			 possibilities?
		3. How could you set up the experiment to allow
			 you to do this?
