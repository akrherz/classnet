I.  Reading / Concepts / Terms
	A. Reading
		1. Chapter 6: 143-150, 153, 163-176
The pages in between have nice examples, but too much detail.  Refer to them as necessary.

	B. Concepts / Terms
		1. Induction
		2. Competence
		3. Reciprocal inductions
		4. Sequential inductions
		5. Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions
		6. Juxtacrine, Paracrine, Endocrine
		7. Passive vs. Instructive interactions
		8. Cell surface receptors
		9. Signal generation pathways
		10. Signal transduction pathways
		11. Transcription factors / transcriptional
				 regulation
		12. Pleiotrophy
		13. Haploinsufficiency
		14. Gain-of-function mutation
		15. Dominant negative
		16. Apoptosis vs. necrosis
		17. Extracellular matrix
 
II. Induction and competence
	A. Paracrine and juxtacrine interactions—TTYP
	B. Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions
	C. Regional specificity-different inducers,
		 same responder--Fig. 6.7
	D. Passive vs. Instructive interactions

III. Induction and competence from the cellular prospective
		—TTYP
	A. Signal generation
	B. Signal transduction pathways
		1. Transmembrane receptors
		2. Not all receptors are at the cell surface
	C. Transcriptional regulation—Backpacking
		 and the example of the Dorsal protein
		 in Drosophila
		1. Transcriptional activators
		2. Transcriptional repressors

IV. Cell death-a normal part of development
	A. What is it good for?--TTYP
	B. An active process
	C. Different ways of causing cell death
