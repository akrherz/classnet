I.  Reading / Concepts / Terms
	A. Reading
		1. Chapter 16: 513-519

	B. Concepts / Terms
		1. Sensitve period
		2. Zone of polarizing activity (ZPA)
		3. Apoptosis vs. necrosis
		4. Dominant negative

II. Revisit AER and Progress zone experiments
	A. What can you conclude from this set of experiments?
	B. Roles for AER and PZ?  Which experiments support
		 these conclusions?  Why?
	C. Possible mechanisms that could encode proximal-distal
		 axis information?
	D. Thalidomide—TTYP—Figure 1.16
		1. When does thalidomide affect arm development?
			  Leg development?
		2. Sensitive period
		3. What does this tell us about the timing of limb
			 development along the A/P axis?

 III. Specification of the anterior-posterior axis
	A. Early establishment of A/P axis—Fig. 18.23
		 (5th Edition)—1938 experiments by Vicktor
		 Hamburger
	B. Zone of polarizing activity
	C. Sonic hedgehog (Shh)

IV. Generation of the dorsal-ventral axis
	A. Early vs. late D/V axis
	B. Role of Wnt7a

V. Cell death and the formation of digits—read
	A. “Necrotic zones” in the interdigital regions and in
		 the forelimb are actually apoptotic zones.
	B. BMPs and programmed cell death

VI. Homework#6-Thalidomide Action
	—15 points Due Monday, April 14.

VII. Think about for the exam
	A. How could you identify a stem cell?  How is it
		 distinct from a precursor cell?
	B. What types of mechanisms could be utilized to specify
		 different regions within the paraxial (or other)
		 mesoderm?  How could you test your models?
	C. What are some of the critical factors essential for
		 forming a limb?</pre>
