	B. Monozygotic twins-identical, one egg
	1. Varieties

VI. Mammalian axis formation and cell fate specification
	A. Nature News Feature—"Your Destiny"
		1. How can you reconcile the fact that we may be
			 able to generate a fate map of a very early
			 mammalian embryo, yet it is possible to
			 "split" an 8 cell embryo and get 8 normal
			 animals?
		2. If Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz is correct about
		 	what sets up the first cleavage plane of the
		 	mammalian embryo, how is this similar to
			another model we have studied?
	B. Early events in mammalian axis specification are not
		 understood.
		1. Think about the possibilities based on what you
			 read in the Drosophila chapter and the
			 Nature article.
	C. Hox genes—Figs. 11.36 and 11.40--This will not be on
			 exam 2
