		 old exam

"Students should not read this material quickly, but too
typical a scene is some poor bastard hunkered over this text
at 2:30 A.M. with a cup of coffee, frantically scanning the
figures to see if he or she can figure out what is
happening."

—Ray Keller--comments to Scott Gilbert about Gilbert’s
textbook, Developmental Biology
