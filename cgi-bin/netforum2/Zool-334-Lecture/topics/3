I. Reading / Concepts / Terms
	A. Reading
		1. Chapter 7:185-206

	B. Concepts / Terms
		1. Sperm-a highly specialized cell
		2. Ovum-another highly specialized cell
		3. Maternal contributions to ovum
		4. Protein synthesis-general mechansims
		5. Egg asymmetry
		6. Chemotaxis
		7. Acrosome / acrosome reaction
			exocytosis
		8. Sperm-egg recognition
			receptor-ligand interactions
			cell-cell interactions
		9. Capacitation
		10. Blocks to polyspermy
			fast block and slow block
		11. Aneuploid
		12. Membrane potential
		13. Cortical granule reaction
		14. Fertilization envelope
 
II. Two specialized types of cells
	A. Sperm-Fig. 7.2
		1. General structure / functions of the parts
	B. Egg (ovum)-before fertilization (oocyte)-Fig. 7.4
		1. General structure / functions of the parts
			a. Vitelline envelope (zona pellucida in
				 mammals)
			b. Plasma membrane
			c. Cortex—cortical granules
			d. Egg jelly (cumulus cells in mammals)
			C. TTYP-fertilization, roles of sperm and
				 egg?

III. Recognition of Egg and Sperm
	A. What needs to happen?-Barriers to the fusion of
		 genetic material?
	B. Attraction of sperm to eggs
		1. Chemotaxis-Fig. 7.9
			a. Species specificity
			b. Receptor-Ligand interactions and cell-cell
				 communications—Ligand-sperm activating
				 peptide / Transmembrane receptor
				 protein
		2. Acrosome reaction-Figs. 7.10 and 7.11
			a. Exocytosis
	C. Contact of gametes
		1. Sea urchin
			a. Bindin and the Bindin Receptor
	D. Something to think about—How does speciation occur?
 
IV. Gamete fusion and the Prevention of Polyspermy-Read

	A. Why is it necessary?-Figs. 7.16 and 7.21
		1. Fast block
		2. Slow block-cortical reaction—Fig. 7.24
		3. Vade Mecum-sea urchin / fertilization

V. Fertilization in mammals
	A. 300,000,000 sperm : 1 oocyte
	B. Which factors are similar?
		1. Still need to bring sperm and egg into contact
		2. Capacitation of sperm
	C. Which factors are different?
		1. Internal fertilization
		2. Mammals do not have a fast block to polyspermy.
