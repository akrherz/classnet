IV.	Mesoderm induction
	A. Animal cap experiments—Fig. 10.21
	B. Linking cortical rotation to Nieuwkoop center
		 formation—A model—Figs. 10.23 and 10.24
	C. Properties of an inducer?
	D. Nieuwkoop Center
		1. A possible molecular mechanism-Don’t worry
			 about the details, but do understand the
			 roles and relationships between the players.
		2. Xenopus Inductions TTYP-Consider the following
			 scenarios:
			a. Expression of an activated b-catenin in
				 presumptive ventral cells.
			b. Expression of an activated GSK-3 in
				 presumptive dorsal cells.
			c. Expression of a dominant negative form of
				 b-catenin in presumptive dorsal cells.
			d. Prevention of cortical rotation.

Is the outcome normal development, a second dorsal axis or suppression of the dorsal axis?  Why?

V. The Organizer
	A. Spemann and Mangold (1924)
	B. Transplantation of the region just above the dorsal
		 lip of the blastopore—Fig. 10.20

VI. Functions of the Organizer
	A. Ventral vs. dorsal fates
		1. BMPs and their inhibitors—Fig. 10.32

VII. Regional specificity of induction—Read
	A. Anterior-posterior issues

"It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation, which
is truly the most important time in your life."
	—Lewis Wolpert (1986)

"We stand in the presence of riddles, but not without hope of
solving them.  And riddles with the hope of solution---what
more can a scientist desire?"
	—Hans Spemann (1927)

"My dear fellow…life is infinitely stranger than anything
which the mind of man could invent.  We would not dare to
conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of
existence."
	—A. Conan Doyle (1891)
