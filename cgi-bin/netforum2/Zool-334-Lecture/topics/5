(2 points each)

___________________is the change in membrane potential caused by an influx of Na+ ions.

___________________is the release of a substance from an intracellular vesicle.

___________________is the term applied to an action that is adequate to trigger an entire series of downstream events.

___________________is the cavity found in a cleavage stage embryo that separates the presumptive endoderm, mesoderm, or hypoblast from the presumptive ectoderm.

___________________is the term that means division of the nucleus.

___________________are the cells of a 32-cell stage mammalian embryo that will form the embryo and some of the extraembryonic membranes.

___________________are loosely connected or unconnected cells.

___________________refers to the migration of individual cells from a surface layer into the interior of an embryo.

___________________is the movement of an epithelial sheet of cells to cover the deeper layers of an embryo.

___________________are the cells that line the archenteron of the Xenopus gastrula.

	(6 points)  (+2 points for each correct answer, -1 for an incorrect answer)










2. Label a fate map of an early Xenopus gastrula.  Mark the locations of the precursors of the following tissues on any
 of the diagrams below.  Note the left drawing represents the superficial cell layer and the right drawing represents the deep layer cells.  (8 points)
(The drawings I used did not copy into ClassNet.  Please refer to fig. 10.5 in your text.

 cleavage).
	(6 points)  (+2 points for each correct answer, -1 for an incorrect answer)










III.  Short Essay

A 9-banded armadillo gives birth to identical quadruplets.  How could you explain this phenomenon?  Describe the
 important events before implantation.  Include the number of eggs fertilized and any cleavage stage events.  (8 points)
