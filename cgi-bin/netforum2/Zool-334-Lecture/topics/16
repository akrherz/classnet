VII. Exam on Wednesday

VIII. Notes added after lecture
I wasn’t able to cover the following ideas and concepts in
	 lecture and they will be useful for you as you read the
	 articles about stem cells over the break.  These topics
	 will NOT be on Exam 3.
	A. Where do stem cells come from?
	1. Embryonic stem cells (ES) are derived from the inner
		 cell mass of the blastocyst.
	2. Embryonic germ cells (EG) are derived from primordial
		 germ cells.  These cells are the future egg and
		 sperm of the adult.
	3. Adult stem cells are derived/isolated from within
		 various organs of the adult.
		a. Hematopoietic Stem Cells-bone marrow
		b. Neural Stem Cells
		c. Muscle Stem Cells
		d. Cardiac Stem Cells

	B. What is transdifferentiation?
		1. Transdifferentiation is a direct violation of
			 what used to be a central dogma in
			 developmental biology, the progressive
			 determination of cell fate.  In its simplest
			 terms, it is a reversal of this process
			 (dedifferentiation) followed by the
			 redifferentiation of these cells.
		2. When thinking about adult stem cells, you will
			 want to consider the role
			 transdifferentiation may play.  Also
			 consider what might happen if the
			 dedifferentiation process did not actually
			 "reset" everything.
		3. There is an example of transdifferentiation on
			 pages 83-84.
