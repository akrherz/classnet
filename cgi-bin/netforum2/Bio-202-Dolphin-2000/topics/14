Study Questions

1. Describe how ATP/ADP serves as a mechanism for conveying energy from one set of metabolic reactions to another. 
2. In metabolism, what is an oxidation reaction? A reduction? Can one occur without the other?
3. How would you describe the function of NAD+/NADH in metabolism?
4. What role do enzymes play in metabolism?
5. If glucose is completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O, what is the free energy change in kcal/mole?
6. In your own words describe what happens in the 10 enzyme catalysed steps on glycolysis. Be sure to describe the number of carbons and hydrogens in the starting material, the number of these atoms in the end material, the energy changes including ATP synthesis, and the role of NAD+. You do not need to memorize the steps of glycolysis, but you should be able to describe what happens in general terms. 
7. What is a phosphorylation reaction? 
8. If it were possible to suddenly remove all of the NAD+ from a cell, what would happen to the rate of glycolysis in the cell?
9. Look at figure 9.17 and observe how some cells are able to regenerate NAD+ from NADH by transferring the hydrogens to pyruvate in what are called fermentation reactions. What do the cells gain by doing this?
