===subject:Root Hair assignment
===message:I wanted to make sure that I did the right thing in this assignment.  From an on campus computer I accessed the Library records, then went to indexes and abstracts, then to Biological Abstracts.  I typed in a search for root hairs, and it printed a small summary of an article.  I want to make sure that the record you get from a non-library computer is the same thing as what you get from the library.
