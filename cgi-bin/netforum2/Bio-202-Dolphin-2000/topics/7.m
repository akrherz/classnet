I know we've not discussed circulatory systems yet, but this question occured to me recently.  What accounts for the feeling of limbs "falling asleep"?  The layman's explanation "a blood 'shortage' to wherever" has never sounded particularly acceptable.  Could this phenomenon be caused by a temporary occlusion of the artery/ies feeding the affected limb?

===message:Dr. Dolphin,
 In relation to your lecture to day I came up with a question about saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.  You stated that unsaturated fatty acids have a double bond between two carbons hence eliminating the complete saturation of all the carbons by hydrogen and such.  What is the signifiance/benefit of this, if there is one?  Does this allow for different uses between the two types? In other words what is the purpose of having a double bond in this setting?

===message:Last semester we learned about the Endosymbiont Theory which suggests that chloroplasts and mitochondria were formerly small prokaryotes living within larger cells.  Because prokaryotes do not have membrane-bound organelles they use their plasma membrane for chemiosmosis and the ETS system.  A mitochondria has two membranes... the inner derived from the original prokaryote plasma membrane and the outer perhaps formed from the host cell's plasma membrane.  Chemiosmosis in eukaryotes is carried out in the mitochondria and the membrane used for this process is the INNER membrane.  This implies that the inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes has the same function as a prokaryote plasma membrane and this seems to me to be very interesting and convincing evidence in favor of the Endosymbiont Theory.  Is this a common argument used? Additionally, is a similar correlation found in the photosynthesis process and chloroplasts?

Regarding restriction enzymes, if an enzyme was "programmed" to cut between "AT", how would it know the difference between a sequence of "AT" and "AATT"?  #2. Is RNA just a bunch of nucleotides all attached together? Or is RNA more complex?  #3.  Does RNA ever accidentally attach to things? Because, RNA is only single stranded, its bases are un-paired, so do these bases ever want to attach to other molecules?  #4. Why is RNA processed (after transcription) before it can leave the nucleus? What is wrong with it?  #5.  Does DNA code for anything besides proteins? It can't code for sugars can it? If not, then I guess the only way humans get their source of sugars is by eating them? #6. When proteins are being synthesized (translation), does the ribosome move across the RNA, or does the RNA move through the ribosome? (understand?)  #7. I know how introns are "junk" DNA found in between genes, but are there introns found within a gene? If yes, how does the RNA skip over that?  #8.  Why does the triplet that codes for START also code for MET? Does that mean that every amino acid begins with MET?  #9.  Why is there more than one triplet/codon for a certain amino acid? Perhaps it was selected to act as insurance against mistakes made? (If a mistake is made, hopefully it won't change the amino acid sequence?) But then why do some a.a's have more triplets than others?  #10.  And, why is there one start triplet, and THREE end triplets?  #11. Even though a mistake is made only once in a billion, aren't there 6 billion nucleotides per chromosome? So there are SIX mistakes every time the DNA gets replicated? Isn't that ALOT?!  #12. When an insertion or deletion is made, the number of nucleotides is not a multiple of three anymore. Does this affect any other genes?  #13. And finally, is a triplet that codes for "end" another way of saying the triplet doesn't code for anything? In other words, because the triplet doesn't code for an a.a, that must mean that it tells the the protein synthesis to stop? Thank you for your patience!

I was wondering about the end products of glycolosis.  In the lab manual it explains that aerobic respiration yields  Co2 and H2o.  But in the Campbell book it says that CO2 is not an end product of glycolosis.  I dont understand if the lab  manual is including glycolosis in the aerobic respiration. What part of aerobic respiration produces co2 and h20.  Was it referring to glycolosis?

For example, I've noticed that tomatoes from parent's garden taste much better than those from a store that were probably ripened rapidly with ethylene.

I learned today that the food in the stomach spends 2-6 hours there, and then it its converted to acid chyme.  Well so the whole theory when you were little about bubble gum staying in your stomach when swallowed for 7 years is totally crazy right? So everything you eat stays in your stomach for 2-6 hours then?  And than the acid chyme is discharged into the small intestine.  I was just wondering about all those myths out there. Thanks.

My question is whether or not this thinning of the blood affects processes such as oxygen transport and the transfer of nutrients to cells.

It showed how they took a mouse and put it in water so it's lungs filled and breathed in the water.  They did this to a premature baby because her lungs were drying out.  You said that water washes out the surfactant which in turn creates too much resistance to open the alveoli.  Does this work because the babies lungs were drying out?  Do you know why filling the lungs with water can help a baby breath but can drown us?

===message:Dr. Dolphin, this doesn't have anything really to do with what we have been talking about but I have had freckles all my life and I was wondering what causes them.  I know it is genetic, but I find it odd that I can go out and spend a couple hours in the sun and then go back inside and find out that i have a billion more freckles.  I know it must have something to do with skin pigment, but why don't i just turn into one big freckle?  What makes a freckle pop up in a certain spot and not in another.  For instance my face, arms and legs a full of them, but when my stomach is exposed to the sun, i don't have any freckles pop up.  Is that due to the fact that my stomach isn't exposed to the sun as often as other limbs?  Just wondering if you knew.  Thanks

===message:I had a cacer in my right ovary for five years ago.
My doctor in student health center said I might have a pre-
cancer in left ovary too when my body couldn't stop 
bleeding.
According to her explanation, the cancer cells in right 
ovary before I took the operation to take out it, already 
metastasized to the part of the left ovary, then I still had 
the problem until I start taking the birth control shot
to stop my period. I wonder how the cancer cells 
metastasized to the left ovary and why the pre-cancer was 
gone by stopping the period. I'm thinking B and T cells can 
work well while the ovary has been inactivated, especially,
T-cells as cell-mediated immunity
