Study Questions
1. Draw the structure of a saturated 16 carbon fatty acid.
2. Show in a drawing how one fatty acid condenses with glycerol to form a monoglyceride.
3. Are triglycerides (triacylglycerols) hydrophilic or hydrophobic? Why? 
4. How does the structure of cholesterol differ from that of a fatty acid? 
5. What is the difference between a triglyceride and a phospholipid?
6. What is an amphipathic molecule? 
7. Make a sketch of the fluid mosaic model of membrane structure.
8. What is meant by membrane fluidity? How can cells adjust their membrane fluidity? 
9. Distinguish between integral and peripheral proteins in membranes.
10. What are six functions of proteins found in cell membranes?
11. What is meant by the membrane permeability?
12. Be able to describe diffusion and three factors that influence the rate of diffusion.
13. Describe facilitated diffusion. How does it differ from active transport? 
14. Describe osmosis in terms of diffusion of water down a concentration gradient. 
15. Describe how active transport mechanism act as "pumps?"
16. How do large molecules get into or out of cells?
