Study Questions
1. In simple terms describe transcription and translation, indicating how they are related to each other in the synthesis of a protein.
2. Describe how a gene that is made of nucleic acid can contain the information necessary to make a protein made of amino acids.
3. Why is messenger RNA called a transcript of gene? How does a codon differ from a whole mRNA? Is mRNA a protein? What is its relationship to a protein? Describe how mRNA is made in a cell?
4. Estimate how many different types of tRNAs are found in a cell? Does each one bind to a different amino acid? Where is the anticodon on the tRNA? What is its function?
5. Describe how codons and anticodons interact? Why is this important?
6. Describe how ribosomes, mRNA, and tRNA with their associated amino acids interact during initiation, elongation, and termination in protein synthesis.
7. If a gene has AAA at the fifth position, what tRNA anticodon would bind at the fifth position of the mRNA made from this gene? Draw it out, do not guess. What amino acid would consequently be positioned at the fifth position?
8. Sit down with a friend and describe how a protein is made by a cell using a transcript of a gene.
9. Name three types of point mutations and give hypothetical examples of their effects on the type of proteins produced in gene expression.
