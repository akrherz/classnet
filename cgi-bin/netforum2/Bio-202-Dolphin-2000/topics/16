Study Questions

1. What are the products of glycolysis? Describe what happens in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. Where does the pyruvate come from? Where does the acetyl CoA go? 
2. In your own words, describe what happens to the organic molecules (acetate) that enter the Krebs cycle. Look at figure 9.11. You do not need to memorize it!
3. What is produced by the Krebs cycle? Why are these products important? 
4. What happens to the reduced electron carriers that are produced in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle?
5. What is the electron transport system? What does it require to function? What does it produce? Where is it located? 
6. In your own words, describe the chemiosmotic theory of ATP production during electron transport. Where in the cell does it happen? Why is it important? Look at figure 9.14, but you do not need to memorize it. 
7. What is the role of ATP synthase in the chemiosmosis? 
8. In aerobic respiration where glucose is the substrate, estimate how many ATP are produced from each glucose molecule broken down (Figure 9.16). If  the energy content of the terminal phosphate bond in ATP is 7.3 Kcal, what percent of the 686 kcal found in glucose is captured for cellular work? 
9. Why do we need to have oxygen in order to live? The oxygen that we breathe in leaves our bodies in chemical combination with which of the following: hydrogen or carbon?
10. What is anerobic respiration? Of the three groups of reactions studied in this chapter, which one is most involved in anaerobic respiration? How many ATP are gained from each molecule of glucose broken down anaerobically? 
11. Describe how the enzymes of glycolysis, Krebs cycle and electron transport do double duty in the breakdown of fats and amino acids.
12. In the three metabolic pathways studied, give examples of where substrate-coupled phosphorylation occurs and where oxidative phosphorylation occurs.
13. What are the roles of electron shuttles in respiration? Where are they reduced? Where are they oxidized?
