Study Questions

1. Draw the linear and ring structures for glucose. There are many different kinds of sugars. In your own words, describe how they differ from each other. 
2. What are the functions of carbohydrates in biological systems? 
3. Would you hypothesize that carbohydrates are hydrophilic or hydrophobic? Why? What experiment that supports your position is conducted by most coffee drinkers each day at coffee break?
4. What functional groups are found in carbohydrates? 
5. Give examples of storage and structural polysaccharides. . 
6. Describe how condensation is involved in the synthesis of carbohydrate polymers and how hydrolysis is involved in their breakdown.
7. Both cellulose and starch are formed from the condensation of glucose units to form polysaccharides. Animals can digest starch and use the sugar content, but they cannot digest cellulose. Look at the bond structure of these molecules in your textbook and in your own words explain what differences you see. These differences explain why animals cannot digest cellulose because the digestive enzymes are very specific and can attack one type of bond but not the other.
