Study Questions

1. Using symbols for deoxyribose, the four nitrogneous bases, and phosphate draw a simple picture of one DNA strand. 
2. Why was the Watson-Crick hypothesis that DNA is a double helix significant?
3. How are the two strands of a double helix held together?
4.  What are the base-pairing rules? 
5. Describe how helicase opens the double helix into two separated strands. 
6. Describe the direction in which  DNA polymerase works on the leading strand. Why?
7. Describe the direction in which  DNA polymerase works on the lagging strand. Why is it different from #6?
8. What are Okasaki fragments and what does ligase do to them?
9. What is the role of primase in the replication of the lagging strand? 
10. Sit down with someone else in the class and carry-on a conversation in which you both discuss how DNA replicates. Refer to Figure 15.14 as a visual aid. 
11. If you need a simple tutorial to understand the replication concept,  look at the one contained in my folder on Biosoftware.
