===more:I decided on the grade cut-offs using the following procedure.(

1) I subtracted the lowest test score from the total points earned. 

(2) I temporarily subtracted the extra points earned from the total earned. 

(3) I took the total points earned (no extra credit) by the best student in the class and set that equal to 100% to adjust for my idiosynchroncies in grading. 

(4) I used the total points by the best student in the class and divided that into the total points earned by each student to get a % for each student. I looked at the resulting distribution of %s and decided that I would use a 90, 80, 70, 60 % grading scale relative to the best student, not the total points that could have been earned. I decided that + and _ grades would be equal to being two points above or below the cut off line. 

(5) I added the extra points back into the total and recalculated everyone's % and then awarded grades. 

The resulting grade distribution for the class is: 33A, 6A-, 3B+, 30B, 11B-, 8C+, 18C, 6C-, 7D+, 12D, 4D-, 21F.
