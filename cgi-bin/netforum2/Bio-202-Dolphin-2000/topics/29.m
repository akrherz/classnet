Breaking Research on Space travel's effects on the immune system presented by the 56th annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology....
Three leading scientists are doing research on the effects of space travel on the immune system. A scientist that did research on the effects of containment on T-cells of subjects during the long 10 month Antartic winter. This isolation was considered to be equivalent to that of space travel. When humans are isolated thier T-lymphocyte system is altered, which may predispose them to infection with common and latent viruses. Another one of the scientists, who did research on the effects of sleep deprivation on the immune system, found that the immune system is also altered by lack of sleep. An increased susceptability to infection, combined with small living spaces within the space stationcould quickly lead to the spread of infection in the crew. Evidence currently points to the fact that space travel may make astronauts more prone to infection by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, and possibly reactivate viruses already present in the body.  The scientists feel that the solution to the immune problems during space travel could also lead to helping people on earth that have immune problems.The site address is...

===message:For many years recurrent pregnagncy loss was often labeled as "unexplained," but recent research shows that as many as 80% of these losses may be attributed to antibody response problems.  In autoimmune problems the immunologic response of the mother to her own proteins causes the rejection of the pregnancy.  This problem can be treated with low-dose heparin, aspirin, and prednisone prior to conception.  Alloimmune problems are those in which the mother's immunologic response to the man's genetic contribution/protein causes the rejection of the pregnancy.  This problem can be treated by immunizing the woman with her husband's white blood cells.  Both of these problems can be determined through blood tests and treatment results in a 10-80% increase in the chance of a live birth.

It is the CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes that help people overcome infections, and AIDS. While it is not clear how they help the immune system, it is apparent that they are needed. Laboratory experiments with mice have found that in the shortage of CD4, the mice were not able to combat any illnesses or immune stresses. In people, soon after HIV is contracted, HIV specific CTS's are made to combat the virus. The odd part is that these CD8 lymphocytes seem to be effective with little or no help from CD4 T-Cells. It is the Walker Hypothesis that suggests that HIV specific T-cells are made that do not need the CD4 cells help. The CD4's are still there, but the T-cells just dont need to utilize them.

characterized by "extacellular deposits" of protein 
materials around one or more organs.  these proteins are

===message:Autism is adevelopmental disability that appears in childhood, usually in the first three years, which curtails the normal development and functioning of the brain in the areas of reasoning, social interaction and
communication. There may be emotional, motor, and sensory disturbances. Frequently a developmental pattern is described depicting a period of normality, then a regression
or loss of skills. Autism is typically defined by practitioners no further than a reference to its neurological basis, together with a list of its outward characteristics or symptoms. Causes of autism have been sought only in the area of genetics, from the time the
condition was first described by Kanner in the 1940s. 

Recent scientific findings have shown, however, multiple immune system abnormalities in autistic individuals. Scientists have alsoembraced the idea of the complex integration of the immune, nervous, endocrine, and other systems of the body; in particular the notion that early and severe derailments of the immune system can lead to profound neurological damage.

T cells are antigen specific, and only a few T cells are made for each specific antigen.  When a T cell encounters a pathogen, the first thing it does is multiply.  Most of the cells become effector cells, which attack the invader, but a few develop into memory cells, which don't attack, but remain behind so the cell information is not lost, and can replicate if more effector cells are needed.

Two reasons are known; there is something wrong with the pregnancy itself(possibly chromosome abnormality) or immunological problems.  The known immunological problems are autoimmune and alloimmune factors that block the acceptance of the pregnancy.  They tested women that had mutliple miscarriages and found that their body would reject the embryo as being forgien.  There are certian phospholipids and anitbodies associated with this.  They ran test on the women after a miscarriage to find how their body responded.  They encourage woman to have tests after a second miscarriage instead of after the third as done in the past.  There are as many as 80% unexplained pregnacy losses so research like this will continue.  The researcher urges couples with miscarriages to take the immunological tests since their chance of miscarriage will increase each time.

One study focuses on the regulatory mechanisms of HIV. It is known that only a handful of genes constitute the HIV genome.  In order to stop the virus, researchers focused on blocking the enzymes needed for the virus to replicate, such as reverse transcriptase and protease.  They are deciphering how the HIV life cycle is controlled.  The activation of HIV structural genes requires the activation of the tat protein and an unidentified cellular cofactor.

One of the projects under the first topic deals with T cell activation.  Cyclosporin A is know to stop the transcription factor NFAT, in the T cell.  They have found however that T cell stimulated by endothelial cells produce NFAT even when cyclosporin A is present.  There reseach is focused of finding the surface receptors that mediate the resistance, and how this resistance is transmitted from cell to cell.

===message:The is the web site explains the virus's progression, viral and T-cell counts, and the difference between HIV and AIDS. It talks aobut that the human body is under continuous attack by a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The immune system's job is to remove or control these intruders and to protect the body from their damaging effects. One of the immune system's most important parts is called a CD4 cell or a T cell. T cells lead the immune response against infections. Specifically, they direct other cells to find and destroy bacteria, fungi, and viruses that cause infections.

This website concentrates on how viruses steal genes from cells, and some have stolen genes that allow them to be unrecognized by the immune system's defenses.  The viruses pretend to be the part of the cell that combines with foreign objects.  These viruses interrupt the immune system response at the very beginning of their cycle.  Proteins from these viruses could be used as gene therapy to cure or treat various immune-based diseases.

Lyme disease is a disease that was discovered in the 70's.  Patients came in with unknown disease characterized by skin inflammation, heart problems, arthritis, and neurological disorders. The bacterium is transmitted only by deer ticks. Researchers induced E. coli bacteria to produce a protein that would kill the spirocyte of the disease before the person infected with the disease even gets symptoms of the disease. A pharmaceutical company has taken over the development of the vaccine to move it through clinical trials and toward the marketplace.

      This site deals with tissue typing.  This is the detection of antigens on the surface of lymphocytes (a particular type of white blood cell.) These antigens make up the HLA System.  The function of the HLA system is that HLA antigens restrict and regulate the immune response in a specific way.  The amino acid sequences of all but the rarest variants of antigens have now been decoded, allowing molecular typing processes to be used. This tissue typing is used in finding matches for donors.

When the body responds to a foreign antigen, one of the most important things that happens is the B cells mature when somatic mutation of immunoglobulin genes occurs. The researchers that made this website are studying the response of B cells in mice because there are many things that are not known about this response.  The mice's B cells recognize the amino acid residue of mouse cytochrome-c or CYT.  This is a protein containing 104 amino acids that has been used to analyze immunoglobulin specificity. It is  
a very important respiratory molecule in the electron transport chain and is normally found between the inner and outer membrane of mitochondria.

===message:The site "http://mcb.berkeley.edu/faculty/IMM/allisonj.html" reports the research interests and findings of Dr. James Allison.  Dr. Allison is currently examining the molecules and processes involved in the differentiation and activation of T-cells.  It was previously thought that the activation of such T-cells was caused by interaction and stimulation of the TCR by only a specific antigen, however, research now shows that another interaction with a non-specific antigen, the "co-stimulatory" receptor CD28, is also necessary in activation of the T-cells by antigen receptor B-cells.  Working with mice, Dr. Allison has observed that a lack of CD28 can lead to detrimental effects in the immune response.  In addition, Dr. Allison is looking at another receptor molecule related to CD28, CTLA-4.  This molecule appears to be involved in inhibition of T-cell development.  This molecule may have potential in fighting primary tumor development.

This was about an Australian research project to investigate the stability of Hepatitis C in the environment using a surrogate virus, the bovine viral diarrhoeal virus.  This project was just recently finished, but its report isn't readily available yet.  However, it did have three major aims.  First, it set out to measure the stability of the Hepatitis C and BVDV genetic material in blood and serum solutions at room temperature in closed plastic tubes, which simulate used syringes, over four and nine weeks respectively.  Secondly, it was to measure the infectivity of the BVDV from the above samples being studied.  Finally, it estimated the amount of time Hepatitis C may be infectious in the environment, with specific reference to injecting drug users.  This was all to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of the spread of Hepatitis C in the injecting drug user population.

They have determined that NK cells play an important part in the defense against early herpes virus infections, but their research suggests that herpes posses some mechanism of evading the subsequent immune response.  They have studied this mechanism by observing the mouse-equivalent to herpes, mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), as it avoids NK cell immune attack on the virus.  Researchers have isolated a protein, m144, that seems to protect infected cells from NK cell killing.  Their experiments suggested that m144 may prevent the normal recruitment and activation of NK cells at the site of infection.
