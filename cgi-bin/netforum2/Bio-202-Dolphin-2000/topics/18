Translation and Protein Structure Assignment

In an attempt to repeat the Jurasic Park scenario, you return from central Siberia  with a tissue sample from a Wooly mammoth carcass that was exposed during excavation of permanently frozen bog. After some simple extraction procedures similar to those used in lab to isolate DNA from onions, you are able to precipitate some DNA in a test tube. You take the DNA to the DNA sequencing lab in the Molecular Biology Building at ISU and ask them to sequence it for you. They start to work and get some result immediately.  They show you a slip of paper with this sequence of nucleotides on it: 

CCATCAGTTTCCATATTACCAGGAAAAAATTAATATAACACT


 What is the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide made by this gene? 









Is the first part of this polypeptide hydrophilic or hydrophobic? 




If this is just a DNA fragment, and not an entire gene or genome, is the fragment from the beginning, middle or end of a gene?</pre>
