===subject:Extra Credit Question
===message:On my last physics exam there was a question about blood pressure in aneurysms.  It stated that an aneurysm is an abnormal enlargement of a blood vessel like the aorta.  For the problem we were to assume that a person with an aneurysm here was lying down so that his aorta was horizontal.  We were then to compare the speed of blood flow and the pressure on the walls in this area to that in the rest of the aorta.  Thinking about this biologically, I knew that the blood would flow more slowly through this enlarged region.  However, it also seemed to make sense to me that the pressure in this area (the area of the aneurysm) would be less than that in the rest of the aorta because the blood would be traveling more slowly and in a much more voluminous area.  The exam answer key said otherwise.  Could you please explain to me how this is biologically possible?
