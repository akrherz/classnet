Study Questions
1. Explain how potential energy differs from kinetic energy.
2. Why is the second law of thermodynamics important in biology? Does it place any limitations on organisms? Does it mean that there are constraints on life? Why? 
3. What is the difference between free energy and entropy? Why is free energy important in biology? Would an exergonic reaction be a source of energy for work or would it consume energy? 
4. Describe what is meant by energy couplingthat  can occur between exergonic and enedergonic reactions in biological systems using ATP as an intermediate.
5. Describe how an enzyme catalyses a reaction. Include in your description a discussion of the substrate shape, active site, and change in activation energy.
6. In cells, there are thousands of different enzymes. How do they differ from each other? How is a cell able to make so many different enzymes? 
7. Why do changes in temperature and pH frequently change the rate of enzyme catalysed reactions? Explain the mechanism. 
8. What is allosteric regulation of enzyme activitity? Why is it important? 
9. What are cofactor and coenzymes? 
10. What is a metabolic pathway?
