Study Questions

1. Look up the the atomic number and atomic weight of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen in your text. Draw the atom for each element showing the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in  each shell.
2. Make a drawing showing the covalent bonds among the atoms found in water. Is the molecule polar or non-polar? Why do you say so? 
3. Make a drawing showing the hydrogen bonds between four water molecules.
4. What is it about carbon that allows it to form so many different chemical compounds? What is a carbon skeleton of a molecule? Do Tinker Toys provide any kind of an analogy to structural organic chemistry? 
5. What is it about functional groups that makes them so important in biological chemistry? Do any of the functional groups convey a polarity to the organic molecules in which they are found? 
6. Why are hydrogen bonds important to living organisms? Name at least four situations where hydrogen bonds are important to the normal functioning of an organism.
7. Use your knowledge of hydrogen bonds and molecular polarity to explain why some chemicals are hydrophilic and why some are hydrophobic. Why do some chemicals dissolve in water and others do not?
8. Approximately what per cent of a cell's weight is due to water?
