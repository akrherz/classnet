Study Questions
1. Describe how RNA may be spliced after transcription, including descriptions of introns and exons. 
2. Describe why a frameshift mutation is of greater consequence than a base pair substitution.
3. Describe the mutation associated with sickle cell anemia. 
4. Describe the role of restriction enzymes, sticky ends, and ligase in making recombinant DNA molecules. (Fug 19.2) 
5. What are cloning vectors and why are they important?
6. Outline the 7 steps involved in using bacteria to clones genes. (Fig 19.3)
7. If you are interested in cloning a particular gene, what are some of the problems that you will encounter in trying to isolate that gene? How could you overcome some of these problems.
8. What is reverse transcriptase and why is it important? 
9. What is the value of the polymerase chain reaction? 
10. Describe how DNA technology is used in the production of vaccines and in human gene therapy. 
11. Describe the steps involved in preparing a DNA fingerprint.
