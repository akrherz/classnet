===more:I believe that there are many ways at looking at this new research.  It all depends on what your values are towards animals or humans.  For me, I consider myself as being a conservationist, so I would have to say no on this new research do to the killing of the butterfly.  To most people a butterfly is not much but to people like me, we know that the butterfly does play a role in nature.
