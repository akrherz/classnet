===more:BY April 24, read a research paper in a physiology journal which was published in 1998 or later. A list of physiology journals is at the end of this note.++++++++++++++                       The subject must be about research into the function of some aspect of the digestive, respiratory, circulatory, excretory, movement, nervous or endocrine systems of an animal either vertebrate or invertebrate. It cannot be about a disease, a treatment for an injury or a medical practice. It must report basic science. I would suggest that Lab Topic 1 in your lab manual would be good background reading before you start.                     

++++++++++++++++++++++++
 On Monday, April 24, you should turn in the following information printed on a single sheet of paper. 


1) Full citation for the paper--See lab manual Appendix D for information on how to properly cite literature in a scientific paper. 


2) A paragraph that in your own words gives the hypothesis being tested and summarizes ther results.


3) A paragraph describing your thoughts about being asked to read this article both before and after reading it.
