===message:With regards to genetic engineering of crops, the same level of caution is appropriate as with any other new, powerful scientific technology.  To be sure, the great amounts of fear that are circulating regarding GM foods are as of yet totally unfounded.  This point aside, we are still compelled to proceed with great care as we work with the most fundamental mechanisms of life.  If we properly and carefully utilize this new technology, the benefits to human society could be enormous -- less reliance on pesticides, higher crop yields, more nutritious foods, and better ag technology in those nations that most desperately need it.  In the end, moderation is the key point.  We would be equally foolish to rush products onto the market without sufficient testing to ensure safety, or to reject this technology which could help so many people merely on the basis of emotionally charged, knee-jerk fear reactions.

===message:This is an interesting topic that is very important to address. From what I read, these crops aren't harmful tohumans. But farmers need to worry if weeds will get a gene to fight against the GM crops. Then it can damage the crops. Also, there needs to be more research to see what amount can kill species. See if they can code the amino acid sequence with the known allergens. There are so many, you want to be protected before they kill.

===message:The articles about Genetically Modified crops gave many indications that not enough research and testing has been done to make sure such crops like Bt corn are safe.  This safety factor applies not only to humans, but for insect ecosystems as well, which can affect other ecosystems in the long run.  Although, it has been asserted that humans are not at risk, much evidence points out that the monarch butterfly is in danger when the GM corn is available.  The idea of GM plants can be an exciting technology which can benefit farmers and consumers, but before any production is carried out, more research needs to be done to ensure the safety of any creature that comes in contact with them.  Also, even though not many immediate adverse effects have resulted from implementation of GM crops, the long run effects should be consulted.  When GM products come to market, the public should be made more aware which products are which with labeling on all food.  This doesn't necessarily mean people will not buy the GM products.  The public can only support what it is aware of.  With more knowledge of GM crops, we can eventually be able to put them on the market and not wonder about their safety.

Due to the fact that humans are growing in population so rapidly I don’t think there would be enough food for everyone to eat. With the way we are growing there is barely enough land to live on, so how are we to feed our selves. But if there could be a bigger yield out of one cornfield that was genetically mutated, to the three fields of normal corn that would have the same yield. I think that it is necessary to use the least amount of land and get the most food out of it. Because we hold a key to helping everyone does not mean that it is wrong. I feel that “God” would not have given us the technology if we weren’t to use it. So in short I feel that modifying crops is the good thing for everyone!

Potentially harmfull effects could possibly magnify as the chemicals pass through the food chain.  Perhaps scientists should look into the health of the birds and rodents that eat the monarchs and the other insects.  That way, any hidden dangers may show up more clear higher up in the food chain.

===message:Genetic manipulation of crops and other things, such as animals and people, has been a hot topic in the last few years.  These GM plants have great possiblities, such as cutting down on world wide hunger, because by producing these engineered crops, we can make them more abundent in the nutrients they already have, we can make them larger and even put different nutrients into the crops that were not originally there but essential to human life. Though the Bt is a great help to the crops I feel that there is easily about 5-10 more years of testing to do on this, considering that basically anything that comes in direct or indirect contact with it dies.  Take for example the monarch butterfly larve that feed on the milkweed near the crops dusted with Bt, over 44% of them died within 4 days (in a labratory experiment).  There are then the insects who eat the insects that have eaten some food with Bt on it, a good percentage of these critters died as well.  I think that for now we need to do two things, test the already known genetically engineered plants and pollen for more adverse effects, and also, before putting it out on the market, test up-and-coming products for adverse effects in humans and other animals.

There has to be some way to make a crop that won't hurt any animals, or the environment.

This was in the laboratory.  Then in a field study they found that milkweeds that are within 1 meter on corn are very unlikely to get dusted with toxic pollen.  It also states that a very small percent of the corn planted has the gene in them.  I feel that we should allow them to be used in corn if it increases the yield or allows for less insectide to be used.  The facts that the protein kills butterflies in untested in the field and the risk for them remains very small.  Also genes that protect against viruses or bacteria are being developed and I believe that should be continued.  Our future is in gene therapy and anything that can help out our agriculture yield without hard facts that the change is harmful should be implemented.

It would be a great thing to not have to worry about the many diseases that plague the crops we grow and be able to grow crops that wouldn't be harmed by the diseases.  It could increase the total amount of crop produced and even produce better crops and it also could cut down the cost of fertilizers, but there is the other side of GM crops.  Some downers of GM crops are, studies have been done that show that monarch butterflies are effected by eating the pollen off of milkweed from GM crops.  Also, the diseases and bugs could eventually become immune to the GM crops and then it would be pointless to use the GM crops.  In some areas, co-ops and corn milling plants, like Cargill won't take bt corn or soybeans, or they will charge different prices for the crop because it is a GM crop. That wouldn't be beneficial to the farmer or for the consumers.   I think we should do some more studies and test the GM crops more and try to get a different and better approach figured out.

===message:While GM crops may help to increase crop production, quality, etc., they are simply not needed.  Advances in technology for taking care of existing, non-GM crops have made productivity so high that the farm land in Iowa can feed more than half the world.  The problem, if it is considered a problem (raging capitalists and those who apply Darwinian theories to human populations certainly don't think of this as a problem), is distribution.  We already have tons of food rotting in warehouses while children starve.  Science can't do anything about that.  While I advocate feeding the world's existing populations, I don't believe upsetting the ecosystem in completely unpredictable ways is the best way to go about it.  Frankly, we can put the whole GM project back in the closet and work with what we already have.  There are simply too many risks involved for those with food allergies, those who think we may not be able to deal with the changes in the ecosystem which we ourselves are about to bring on, those who are bothered by eating food about which very little is known, and anyone who is concerned about putting proteins where they just don't go naturally.  If we want to help people, we need to take political action, not start tinkering with genomoes when do not and cannot have any real concept of what will happen.

THE real problem here is not production of food, but production of humans.  Yes, we need to feed people who already live, and yes, we need to improve the quality of life for the starving masses, but spewing out tons of food which could kill them (by allergies or by long-reaching and unforseen effects of the genetic modification) isn't going to do it.  What really needs to be done is to limit populations to reasonable levels.  It's simply not practical to believe the earth can continue to support huge numbers of bodies.  If we are one day forced to use GM crops in order to produce enough for ourselves to just survive, we will know we're screwed.  For now, we're still at semi-reasonable though well over optimal numbers.  I don't believe in forced birth control or anything along those lines, but if something isn't done (education and distribution of birth control would be my ideal), we're all going to be pretty miserable.  Imagine the earth being nothing but patches of farmland in a sea of Los Angeles-style city; that's where we're going to go if we don't do something to curb populations.  Why should we be encouraging the types of crops that would make that all possible?  Besides, the current GM crops don't even all increase productivity; why take risks with the ecosystem when we don't have to?

OVERALL, GM crops are more a hinderance to human life (and life on earth as we know it) than they are a boon.  If humans as a race want to survive, we would do well to drop the idea for now.  And if we don't, well, life goes on with us or without us.  It's simply a matter of how much we want to be here to witness it.

New technology and advances in genetics point to exciting new possibilities.  Theoretically, they can be used instead of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, helping the environment.  They can be used to increase production, making better use of the land available and reducing the need to clear new land for farming.  But also, little is known about the consequences of tinkering with genetics.  There could be unforseen effects, not only on the plants and humans who eat them, but on the animals and other plants that interact with them, and on the environment as a whole.  The interactions within an ecosystem are unbelieveably complex and it is impossible to understand them all completely.  This means that we cannot know the full effects this new technology will have.  It poses a very difficult question:  Do we continue on with GM crops and risk the potential side-effects, or do we halt the use of GM crops and give up the benefits they offer?  I think perhaps the best course of action is to proceed cautiously with any new products, testing them thoroughly and considering the possible effects, while keeping close watch on the existing products to see the kinds of effects they have in the long run.

The article mentioned that Bt toxins could indirectly threaten benificial insects such as the green lacewing caterpillar.

===message:I find it hard to take a stance on this subject because even the experts cannot agree.  For some reasons I believe that GM crops will have a positive impact on our society.  Based on evidence presented in the article, GM crops benefit the environment because farmers do not have to use as many pesticides, and they do not have to till the soil as much leading to less soil erosion.  On the other side of the issue, there is not enough research that says that these crops are good for us.  I think that we need to take into perspective that there are many unknown effects from these crops.  Who knows, maybe twenty years down the road they'll find that these crops pose serious health hazards not only to humans, but to other organisms on earth.  They have already discovered some potential heath hazards to monarch butterflies, as discusse in this article.  Another issue that concerns me is that the industry is concerned about how much money they are making on the crops and they think that if labeling is required, they will lose money.  Does everything have to be about money?  What are they going to do if all of the consumers die because of some unknown health hazard?  I know that is an extreme statement, but they are going to extreme with the money issue.  After all, if they didn't have consumers, they wouldn't make a profit anyway.  I think that labeling should be required because it will allow consumers to make up their own minds instead of money-hungry industrialists deciding for us.  If consumers do not buy the products, it will give the industry a reason to put all of their strenghts into ong-term research so that they can reassure the consumers that their product is safe.

===message:I think that until we know more about the different affects of genetically modifying crops, we should proceed with caution.  The monarch butterflies are an example because a gene that coded for a protein harmful to the butterflies was inserted in the corn.  It gave the corn the added benefit, but it could be argued that there were adverse affects on the butterflies.  So until we know more about the effects on the environment, adding a gene that might benefit in one way, might actually be toxic to the environment.  I have to say I find it ironic that humans have made mistakes before on this kind of project.  When everyone thought that DDT was the greatest thing in the world for killing insects, they were wrong.  The same can be said for genetically modified crops because we are tampering with something that still evades us to how it all works.  For me this is a signal to stop and reevaluate how important it is to produce one more kernel of corn.  It may sound preposterous that all the details would have to first be known, but it makes sense at least to me.  Because sometimes it is the details that count.  There are endless examples where someone has forgotten detail and the end result is catastrophe.  There is the benefit of the genetic crops, but at what cost is basically what I am saying.

===subject:GM crops should be treated like they are drugs.
===message:     GM crops, like many engineered substances, have the potential to make life a little better in a number of ways--many of which were discussed in the article.  However, consuming foods which are genetically--and thus, chemically--altered should be approached with the same caution required for the public use of any artificially synthesized substance.  
     When a pharmaceutical company comes out with a new drug, extensive testing must be done.  The acute toxicity, long-term toxicity, behavioral and physiological effects, and tolerable human dosages must be determined with animal studies using several different species before extremely controlled human studies can even begin.  Then, years of carefully documented studies are conducted on a range of sample types.  Finally, after all of the testing and documentation, all of the paperwork (usually an entire truckload of some 50-100 large volumes) is shipped off to washington to be approved by government pharmaceutical agencies.  If anything is incomplete or unsafe or improperly documented, the drug is rejected and the company must continue studies or start over from scratch.
     I am not suggesting that this stringent of policies are necessary for GM crops, but it is clear that years of extensive research should preceed public consumption of GM crops.  After all, they do contain chemically synthesized compounds that meet the strictest definitions of a drug.

===message:From reading the article, I have come to the conclusion that genetically modified crops are not such a good idea.  There are many problems that arise with this idea that become a concern to the environment and the public.  There are health risks that have to be considered and potentially harmful resistant genes that could develop.  As stated in the article, one example that is greatly effected by this opposition, is the monarchs.  Even though it is revealed that they are at a minimal risk, migration patterns can be interrupted, and food chains threatened.  This will then lead to an even more dangerous pattern.  Also, there is no need to create a so-called super-weed which inturn will disrupt the natural ecosystem and pose potential hazards to lowering the crop yields.  Yet still, another point I would like to state is that only a few independent studies have been conducted, so if this issue would be even considered atlarge, then of course more research would have to be taken.  As in the case of the Bt corn seed, the increased profits from higher corn yields did not cover the extra costs.  We could be better spending our money on a more useful aspect in today's society.  However, I agree, since we have this technology to overcome these obstacles in our way, there is no need to make a perfect world out of it.  There is a better way to use our resourcees.  Much more drastic measures should be taken in other fields to improve our lifestyles.

It is beneficial to the farmers that have treated their crops, but I believe that we should let the crops grow in their natural state.  I dont think it is necessary to have these super-crops that are resistant to many pests.  The treatment has been found to be harmful to some species such as the monarch, and they also may create some allergies.  This will just create more issues and arguments within the biological field.

If any product, from food to toys, has the ability to harm anyone/anything, it should be labelled and people should be told.  If farmers are just going to use Bt corn for their profit and not care whether it is killing off a population of butterflies, we have a problem.  If pests become resistant to Bt toxins, that is an even larger problem. The insect population would get out of control and the Bt would serve no purpose. The Bt toxins could also get into the foodchain and eventually have a harmful effect on humans.  Overall, if researchers are unsure about a product's effects on health and the environment, it should not be out on the market. GM Crops should be banned.

===subject:Europe thinks we are crazy
===message:One of the simplest ways to judge how worthwhile the use of something is, is  by weighing the costs and benefits.  The benefits are very strait forward in GM crops.  The crops are less expensive to grow because they do not have to be sprayed and because yields are higher.  (For some reason,it always seems to come down to money.)  The cost is where a gray area occurs.  How much is the ecosystem hurt?  How much is a human body effected?  Because data is just now starting to emerge, these questions are just beginning to be answered.  As with any new idea, there are extremists. And for some reason bad news penetrates into the mind with more force than good news.  Therefore, a general panic sets in.  In Europe GM franken foods are all over the news.  They have gone so far as to label all foods with modified genes.   In addition, they have created a strong demand for the organic green grocer.   (They think the US is crazy for eating these foods.  I think the US just doesnt know they are.)  The public has decided the cost is stunted growth and no butterflies.  In their mind GM foods are not safe.  With out a demand the market will not be profitable.  The scientist are not declaring a decided cost with out more research.  So for the next couple of years GM food will be a hot topic and new studies will be released until a general census is found.  And then, years from now we will look back and wonder why it was ever so controversial.

===subject:Putting GM Crops on Trial
===message:  Whenever a trial is presented before a jury, the opposing sides will each lay out their case and present the evidence that supports their claim.  The jury then weighs the evidence and votes in favor of the side that is most convinving.  It is key that sufficient evidence be gathered in order for the jury to make a wise decision.  I believe that this is also true in order for the world to reach a conclusion on the existence of genetically modified crops - more evidence needs to be gathered on both sides of the debate.
 So far the anti-GM movement has raised several concerns, but research has led to mixed conclusions.  For example, the issue has been raised that the B+ protein that some GM plants produce could be harmful to monarch butterflies.  Experiments that were done in labs proved that this statement was true, however research in natural environments led to mixed conclusions.  The results of one experiment showed that even milkweeds that were within 1 meter of the crops were unlikely to be dusted with toxic levels of the B+ pollen.  Some scientists ruled this as a positive sign, while others claimed that damage could still be done, even if it was to a lesser degree.  
 Other concerns were raised as well and led to data that resulted in a variety of conclusions.  one of these issues was the risk of pesticide and virus resistant genes being passed to weeds that could then outgrow ordinary plants.  Some scientists believed that this was unlikely, while others argued that there was a sufficient risk.  Another dispute involved the industry claims that GM crops would cut down on a farmer's costs for pesticides.  Some studies showed that while the costs for pesticide applications were lower, so were the yields.  A lot of the evidence gathered on these issues has led scientists to more questions and mixed opinions than it has to accurate scientific conclusions.
 While scientists debate, the public opion has been carried away by rumors and fears that genetically modified crops would be harmful to human health.  The public opinion has carried a lot of economic weight, especially in England, where the consumers have demanded to be more informed.
 If I were to be a jury member in a case putting GM crops on trial, I believe I would have trouble making a wise decision based on the amount of evidence that scientists have discovered thus far.  I believe that there are many benefits of GM crops, including improved yields which could lead to efforts to reduce malnutrition in the world, environmental protection due to the use of fewer pesticides, and an improved economy. However, I also believe that there are valid reasons to be concerned, including health risks to both humans and creatures such as the monarch butterfly.  At this moment in time, I believe that the benefits outweight the risks, however, I agree with Cook from Washington State that, "We can't ignore the risks."

These plants cost less to grow and yeild more than their original organic predecessors, which leads to the overall wealth maximization of our country; or does it?  If butterflies are dying, shouldn't we think about the harmful side-effects of these GM crops before we decide to turn them loose on the unsuspecting general public?  What has the agrucultural economy gotten itself into? We don't know, and that is the problem.  Maybe the butterflies are the only beings that are harmed by these GM crops, and then again, maybe they are harmful to humans.  Who is to say until extensive tests are done on these plants?  Here is the problem:  we are faced with an issue in which we do not have enough information.  Tests need to be run on these plants to discover if in fact they are harmful to humans or other organisms (besides the butterflies that is) and then preventative measures must be taken.

These costs include labor, machinery, and the chemicals used to treat the regular varities of crops.  The article also did not mention the effect of Europe not buying these crops from the U.S.  This is part of the reason that the commodity prices are so low this past year.  That has really set back the farmer, so he must make a decision between planting a regular variety and paying more production costs, or planting a GM variety and taking a hit in the market.  I think that if companies want to do anything to make the consumer aware of these crops, just label the package and let them make a decision. If some of these things don't change, the farmer will be paying after everything is said and done.

GMO's definitely have some beneficial outcomes, but nobody knows all of the side effects they create- it is just too new.  Genetically altered food should definitely be labeled when put on the shelves for consumers.  There may be many reasons consumers may not support them.
	First of all, GMO's alter the ecosystem.  For instance, the effect bt corn causes on the butterflies goes farther than just the monarchs.  There are organisms that eat these insects, etc- the food chain is disrupted, and a little effect down the line can create a tremendous one eventually.
	Also, scientists think GMO's don't prove detrimental to the consumers directly, but they do not know for sure.  For example, the Brazil nut gene added to the soybean.  This line was never marketed, but this shows that side effects can occur.
	Alternatives should be looked at, such as organic farming.  The conventional farming practices used in the US today are detrimental to the health of people, animals, and the environment.  Organic farming is an alternative that helps sustain the land, and organisms and the streams do not receive the excess chemicals.  Organic farming can be as productive as conventional farming if the farmer is properly educated.  Why don't we put more money towards this instead of new biotechnology?

While the ideas of being able to genetically modify crops to increase productivity and efficiency not to mention the prospects of increasing the nutritional value of foods or producing foods that lack certain allergenic proteins are certainly appealing, the repercussions of such actions must be carefully examined.  I believe that much more research is needed in this area and that perhaps the EU has the right idea with its labeling and moritorium efforts.  Until we are more clear as to the long term health effects of GM crops and their impact on the environment, I believe that we should hold off on their mass production.  GM crops hold what could be a very promising future for both farmers and consumers, however, with the current lack of substantial evidence that they are safe we must simply be patient as the potential negative effects are incredibly grave and far reaching.

Monarch butterflies should not have to be harmed.  Their

an extremely low survival rate.  If other plants, likes

===message:The debate over GM crops is one of key importance in the this rapidly developing science as its outcome will likely have an overwhelming effect on the GM science's future.  The first and foremost concern with the development of any new organism should be how it will exist in that natural world.  We must be mindful to not forget that the organisms which are being produced are exibiting completely new attributes and have a great potential to exhibit unplanned and unexpected attributes aside from benefit of their target modification.  The problem of Bt toxin effects on monarch butterflies is a perfect example of such unknown side affects which may develop.  It seems to me that right now, the major concern of most companies which are developing GM crops is monatary benefit and not ecological impact and this is a dangerous attitude.  Although the mortality of the Bt toxin from GM crop pollen in monarchs has not yet been proven, there seems to be substantial evidence to support the idea.  And other concerns are building, such as the spread of antibiotic resistance to other species via cross-pollenation.  The great potential for mankind's benefit from GM organisms must not be overlooked, but at the same time, care must be taken to ensure that this relatively new science is fully understood in terms of the environmental and health affects it can manifest.  We have examples of very postive and very negative results from GM crop use and it may be that the good must be taken and the bad thrown away.  GM in cotton has thus far exibited excellent return, showing few problems and a much higher yield while allowing a substantial limit on pesticide and herbicide use.  However, GM corn use in the midwest seems to show opposite results, costing farmer more than it is worth.  In the end, careful testing and attention to detail are areas that cannot be ignored if GM science is to be implimented in the future without fear of unforseen problems or open opposition by consumers.

There is reason to be scared of the possibility that the antibiotic-resistance gene could spread to humans through the corn.  This could cause bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics and could eventually lead to an epidemic of diseases.  Even though this thought is a long shot, is our society ready to deal with the possibility?  Also, there is substantial evidence that GM crops have an effect on monarch butterflies.  Does our fragile ecosystem need to be upset more?  It would be great to play "hero" and find a way to make enough food to make sure everyone in the world had enough to eat at all times, but the risks associated with this thought aren't feasible just yet.  Until the makers of GM crops can assure the consumers that these products are safe, I don't believe that they are ready for market.  However, this idea does have good intents and with a little more research...who knows these producers may have found the answer to the problem of hunger.

===message:The benefits of GM crops can be a very good thing, but it is also a very new idea.  Most of the worries that have arised from different researches have been studied further and they were found to be not not so harmful after all.  I think if things are taken slow enough and enough time is taken to observe not only short term effects but also long term effects, GM crops can be an outstanding addition to not only our nation but the world.  Giving GM crops a chance is the only sensible thing to do.  I really liked Bruce Chassy's comment on how putting GM products on the shelf is basically the same as putting any new product on the shelf.  I also feel very strongly, however, that the public has a right to know what they are buying and eating.  I think that if GM products are put on the shelves, they should have a label that identifies them as a GM product.  I can't say whether or not this will effect the products' sales, but I think it is the right thing to do.  If the engineers of this product are so sure that they are giving the public something safe to eat, they should have no problem standing behind their product.  I also found it very interesting that certain products had much more to gain from the genetic modifications than others.  I also think this should be taken into account.  For example, the modifications on cotton had very big benifits.  The modifications on corn, however, were not that much more beneficial if benificial at all.  Why should we do something to the crops that could be harmful to humans and the environment, if it is not going to undoubtedly benefit us.  But if something is going to really help everybody out, why not use that to our full advantage?
I am for GM crops, but only if it is approached at a safe pace, deeply researched, and used with caution.  Once something starts to go wrong, it is most likely too late to stop and fix it.

Not to mention what it is happening to the life that used to depend on farm crops to survive.  So what if a few worms or butterflies die, no big deal but when a  chain reaction in the food web occurs, which might be a posibility it is going to be really bad.

have to wonder, when is nature going to decide that we've 
messed with it too much? One day, our attempts to modify 
something may backfire. Likewise, plants have been growing 
on their own, without help and genetic assistance, for quite 
some time. I just have to notice that some of the biggest 
advantages have to deal with more production, making more 
money, and saving money based on the decrease of pesticides 
used on plants. I think that this simply supports the fact

Before us lays a "new frontier" of sorts and it is indeed human nature to not only seek to understand the unexplainable but also to take advantage of what knowledge we do acquire.  The industrial revolution is a prime example.  Although we are now almost totally dependent on a dwindling fossil fuel supply, it is hard to argue that humankind has not progressed by means of this revolution.  And so it will go with the biotech revolution.  Harnessing the power of the gene will advance our species but most likely at a dear cost.  Assuming that the "Age of Biotechnology" is here to stay, it is imperitive that we proceed with both confidence and cautiousness.  At each new step we must weigh all possible benefits and disadvantages.  This of course involves considerable long term research and also, and perhaps more importantly, consumer/public education.  The GM crop debate is only a foreshadowing of what is yet to come.

I agree with the example of the monarch butterflies obtaining pollen from GM plants.  We can't predict very well how far the pollen will travel from the GM fields that it was produced in; therefore, organisms such as the monarchs and other insects are continually at risk of being exposed to this modified pollen.  Another reason I don't think the GM crops are very beneficial is because of what the article mentioned about how the farmers of GM crops didn't make a substantially larger amount of money than with normal crops, due to the higher cost of GM seeds.  If they don't make more money with the GM crops, then what is the point of using them, especially when they pose risks to other living organisms?  Also, the effects of the GM crops could eventually enter our food chain and create dangerous situations for those individuals with food allergies.

GM crops work on some crops but not on all crops and the crops that they don't work well on include: corn and soybeans Iowa's two primary crops. I believe that farmers should continue to plant conventional crops because the GM soybeans had lower costs and lower income so weren't benificial. I think that GM crops don't give farmer's that much of an advantage and if conventional crops have been working for this many years let's not disrupt a good thing.

===message:GM crops definatly have the potential to be a great benefit to the world.  Before they are introduced to the public though there needs to be extensive testing done on the GM crops.  There are potential risks that need to be adressed.  For example, there are opposing views on whether or not the GM crops will effect the ecosystem.  Another potential risk is whether or not the GM crops are harmful to humans.  On the other hand, there is also a potential for GM crops to benifit more than just the producers.  GM crops can be made to have more protiens and vitamins, a benifit to the consumer.  I believe that these issues among others need to be adressed before the GM crops are marketed to the public.  Until then the GM crops should only be used for testing and not for the consumer. People need to look at all of the facts about GM crops instead jumping on the Greenpeace bandwagon and saying that they are all bad.

===message:I believe that genetically modified crops are definetly a potential danger to humans and animals.  Although they present many advantages such as becoming resistant to pests, they also pose many dangers.  Presently, I don't think that genetically modified crops should be consumed by animals or humans because there is just not enough research proving to me that these are safe to consume.  I agree with the article when it stated that consumers will be the ones to choose if genetically modified crops will be used in the future because if the consumers refuse to buy these products, they will not have enough money to continue to produce them.  With more research and developments, and possibly more technology, I believe that one day genetically modified crops will be safe to consume, but until then, I am wary of their effects.

===subject:GMO's are going to create monsters
===message:GMOs seem to be a great idea. What farmer wouldn't want a feild that can be sprayed for bugs and weeds without killing their crop? It increases your yeild by lessening the destruction by insects and or weeds. Sounds great right? What about the environment? Introducing a crop like this one will make it resistant to things like round up weed killer, but by doing this it will change the ecosystem. Initially, the crops will do well and the insects and weeds will die off. Eventually, the weeds and insects will become stronger and more resistant. It will become like the DDT incident. It will kill off the insects initially but the insects become immune to the effects. Whenever you change an aspect of the ecosystem there will always be changes to other species in that ecosystem. Everything in the feild's ecosystem will be thrown off balance. This is seen already in the fact that it is seen to be killing off certain moths and butterflies. It wasn't originally engineered to do this so there is another change that will occur in the ecosystem. The dissapearance of these insects will cause other animals and insects to die off since these insects are a food source for them. Changing this one part of the ecosystem will lead to other greater changes that can not be calculated at this time. So, while GMOs seem to be a great idea, they will end up being bad for farmers and the environment later on along the road. At this time I believe that GMOs should not be used. They are not investigated enough and the future effects are not yet known.

===message:Genetically modified crops ,GM crops for short, sound like a risk to be used right now.  They should not be totally gotten rid of though just because they have been shown to have negative effects on the surrounding organisms.  Right now there should be more testing.  This testing should be done to see what can be done to avoid these negative effects.  Also not all the effects of these types of plants are known.  So how are people supposed to know what will happen in the long run from the effects of the plants?  There needs to be more testing.  Plus if it is found that the crops are not that harmful ,then they need to be made more economically efficient.  Right now the GM crops produce more ,but because of costs they are not that great to high yielding farmers. So the main thought right now should be testing.  There just needs to be more of it.

I have worked in a genetics laboratory over the past two summers, and I know that the research that is done in genetic engineering is extensive and all possible precautions are taken to make sure that a new product will not be hurtful to nature. If the product is, it is possible to alter it so it will not be in the future.

It has been stated that there are minimal risks to human health, but it poses a threat for animals. It is fatal for rats and butterflies when injesting the plants.  Plus, the genes may spread to wild plants and produce new strain of weeds, which poses to be a problem.  Even if these new GM crops were to pass FDA, the question among food alergies arises.  But when you think about it, many people had problems with WOW potato chips and other products, so it has to be taken into account, but one can't throw the idea out the window just because one might be alergic to it.

They can make more money with GM crops.  Farmers are already paid not to farm part of their land to keep surpluses down.  This limits their profits (at least that's what it seems to them) They figure if they can increase production on what land they can use, they get more money.  Yay! Greed at work.<p>
However, that does not mean GM crops are bad.  They can be used for good.  (this is starting to sound like starwars) If we were to produce a crop that would crow willy nilly in a place like india, for instance, and then take those happy little seeds over there and teach them how to farm with those crops. Boom, hunger problems solved.  However, that isn't going to happen because our greedy little capitalist society doesn't like giving away money, time, or seeds.  But that is what the real potential of GM crops are.  Making things able to grow where they can't grow easily and finally making places like india or somalia or wherever else there is famine self sufficient.

===message:I believe there are some significant benefits to using genetically modified food crops, particularly in developing countries where most of the agriculture is currently at subsistance levels.  Many of the crops currently used there are bred for growth in the United States or European nations and are susceptable to local diseases in the third-world countries (Agrios, George N., <u>Plant Pathology</u>, 1988 ed. p. 27).  More crops are lost to disease and pests in Africa, Asia, and South America than in more highly developed countries.  Part of the reason for this is that agriculture is not the large scale business that it is in the developed countries.  Subsistance farmers cannot often afford to treat their crops with the necessary pesticides to ensure a substantial yield, and the climate of these countries is often not ideal for the crops being grown.  Engineering crops more suitable to hot, dry climates and less reliant on pesticides could, over time, decrease the costs to farmers in these countries and could allow them to become more developed, helping stave off the problems of world hunger.  <br>
Obviously there are problems inherent in the genetic engineering of plants.  By increasing testing of these crops and by funding studies to ensure their safety, we can decrease the environmental concerns associated with the GM crops.  Also, we can regulate use of these crops on a local/regional basis.  For example, BT crops which are potentially harmful to monarch butterflies could be more strictly regulated in areas where the butterflies live, but would be relatively safe in areas not included in the monarch habitat.  Additionally, those crops which were shown to produce little increase in yield or which did not significantly reduce the use of pesticides will not prove to be economically sound for use by farmers.  Most farmers will not continue using these crops and will switch instead to safer or more effective crops, thus ensuring that seed companies must continually improve their crops.  <br>
Overall, I feel that most GM crops offer excellent advantages for farming or at least prospective advantages.  As with any product, a certain amount of research must be done into its environmental effects, and I think that the biggest problem with the GM crops is not their potential hazards but the lack of research being done on these hazards.  More work must be funded to research the crops so that they can be continually improved and so that money is not wasted on poor-yielding, environmentally unsafe crops which do not have the promised benefits.

Although the opponents of genetic engineering can make a few good points about the lack of diversity it causes and about some of the harmful side effects that it also creates, I am firmly in favor of the genetic engineering of crop species in agriculture.
First of all, the largest reason for all of the debate can be traced, to a degree, to a simple terminology problem.  These crop species are currently called "Genetically Modified Organisms."  I believe that this term scares many people out, because it sounds like we're playing God.  That's why I believe that these crops should be classified into a category of technology called "Selective Breeding Techniques."  This term sounds much less offensive and less controversial.
Finally, there's the fact that these genetically engineered crops will greatly improve crop yields, thus greatly increasing the world's food supply.  There are millions of human beings that are malnurished around the world, and genetically engineered food is the only chance we have to feed all of them.  This new technology also allows the farmer to make more money, which will allow more farmers to stay out of debt, and thus create more food for the world.
Thus, since the harmful side effects suppossedly associated with these crops can't be proven true, there's no way that we can afford not to adopt them, for these products are the one chance we have to truly feed the world.

Yeah The question here is where are we going to draw the line between technology and creation. Sure we will benefit from GM crops but we have to ask ourselves, Are we all? Is it really necessary?. The answer is not really, the only ones who are going to benefit from this technology are the persons in charge of the big corporations and in a larger scale the industralized countries. Why do I say this because farmers are not going to see a huge diiference in their income because of GM crops the companies they sell it to are not going to allow them to get more money out of it than what they make so they are going to continue buying it for the same price if they're lucky because they will probably buy it for less. The other point is that if we would say that this technology would be one that will be free of cost and that it could be reached by anyone then this will be wonderful. Unfortunately we live in a world full of greed and ambition for power and this technology will soon be commercialize and have a price, a very high price.

Even if the monarch butterfly is not killed off by the corn pollen, it is still harmed in some way. (Some say that the effect is that the butterflies can not make their journey south to Mexico.) 
The second question that arises is whether the gene will transfer to the surrounding plants. 
One item that has been overlooked with all of these questions is the benefits of genetically modified crops. For example, GM cotton  reduces the amount of chemicals used for eleminating harmful insects. This helps the environment by reducing the amount of  herbicide runoff. 
The only problem with that is the idea that maybe the farmers will still apply the "faithful and trusty" herbicides that have worked before along with the new genetically modified sprays. "Roundup Ready" corn is a good example of farmer doing just that. The farmers would plant the roundup ready corn and then apply the single dose of roundup to the field, but still spray the same chemicals they did before.

All in all, I believe that Genetically Modified crops is a good idea, but one that needs to be developed more. It MAY be ready to be on the market, but not for the ammount of crops it is used on now. Those plants where the genetic modification can truley help without serious side effects should use the new modification, ut those that don't help shouldn't use it. (An example would be that cotton should use it, but corn needs more development.)

===message:I think that GM crops have both advantages and drawbacks.  They can allow farmers to use less pestacides, which has very beneficial environmental effects. They can be used to increase the nutrition of various plants, which is good for people in general and can make major improvements in the general health of developing nations which rely on one or two crops for thier food and are too poor to trade for other kinds of food much, leaving them subject to poor nutrition due to unbalanced vitamin intake.  They can increace food yeild per plant, allowing more food to be produced within a given acrage. They can also give viral resistance to beneficial plants that are being wiped out by disease. (some fear that the viral resistance may transfer to weeds, leading them to compete against the plant they were initially trying to save, but i think that it will cause much less damage than if we were to simply let the "good" plants die out of disease.)  On the other hand, some GM crops may be less nutritious, (ie: the rat-stunting potatoes) some may be harmfull to local fauna, such as the Bt corn, which may be harmfull to Monarch butterflies.  Some people fear that the herbicide-resistant plants may transfer resistance to weeds, leaving the weed resistant to herbicides.  Also, some may contain protiens that can cause allergic reactions.  Overall, i think that GM crops have great potential benefit to the human race, but we need to be carefull about how we use them. Extensive, long-term testing should be a requirement that is strictly enforced, and i think that products containing GM plants, or at least the ones with potantially allergenic protiens, should be labled.

===subject:What a load of crop
===message:I do not agree that we should be genetically modifying ANY organism until there has been enough research done on the subject. Without fully understanding the consequences, we cannot honestly say that GM crops are a good thing. Perhaps, (as of right now), they are good for OUR species, but they can be and ARE also detrimental to other species. I believe that to be very selfish of us, to pretend that we are the only organisms that matter. Not to mention the fact that everything we (humans) do to affect the environment, affects us. To argue that GM crops yield more and therefore will end world hunger is preposterous. We could end world hunger NOW if we chose to do so. There is more than enough food for everyone. To me, it always seems to come down to money. The more yield, the more profit. However, I DO feel that GM crops can help benefit humans AS WELL AS other species. I am a genetics major so I see the power and promise genetic engineering holds, but as of today, we are not prepared to effectively g-modify our crops. When we have done enough research, then I will support GM crops if the TOTAL benefits out way the detriments.

===message:It seems to me that the question of the whether or not the growth of Genetically Modified crops should be regulated can be answered fairly simply. In light of the exponential population growth that we will be experiencing in the next century, ways to increase the food supply such as GM crops will have to be explored.  Of course we should make sure that scientific testing is done to prevent problems.  But GM crops could go a long way toward feeding a lot of people.

     I believe, in the long run, the future of GM crops in the market will be placed on how the consumer "feels."  A lot more research needs to be put into the affects of GM crops on the environment AND the human body.  The positive aspects of using these products can be hypothesized out the ying-yang, but the consumers will need proof.  More money must be invested into obtaining this proof and making realistic properties for using GM crops.  Until that happens, all this hype will lead to a dead end.:(

===subject:GM Crops???
===message:I think that there are some advantages for some people and disadvantages for others. Plants can make more nutrients and vitamins but it can also spread to other plants and that wouldn't good for them. It could be bad for humans that are allergic to some foods that are normally grown and the foods that are genetically grown may have the same genes that normal food has and those people could become severly ill or die. There are a lot of opinions that are floating around, but if they can come up with something that can be all around safe for humans, animals, and all types of plants then I am all for it, but if there is any doubt that there could be any way that it would be harmful to any organism then I think they should ban it. Right now there is hearsay that it stunts growth in rats and messes up their genetic plans then I don't think that it is safe enough for humans.

Let me tell you that there are thousands of people not only in China or India, but around the world that go hungry every day.  If GM Crops can help few of those people out then they are worth it.  It also, help us in coding different types of proteins that have not been coded for.  If we push forth the idea of GM Crops then, we may solve the problem of hunger.  To be honst, I am kind of tired of all of the commericals that deal with stavings nations.  We have a common goal of making sure that there are no more hungary mouths of children from around the world.  We can say that there is a moral effection in GE Crops, but let me ask you this question, what part of society doesn't have a moral effection?  If we can help just one person, then why don't we?

===message:My opinion of the article is that I do not believe in genetic engineering on crops.  The reason I do not agree with genetic engineering is because I feel that we will do more harm than good.  Like it said in the article, by coming up with ways to have antibodies in crops we could also by mistake make a super-weed.  This will cause more problems than it's worth.  It also stated in the article that this could cut back on pesticides which would be good for atmosphere.  But at the same time is something went wrong and we came up with new types of weeds, then we would have more problems than we started with.  In result, more harmful pesticides will have to be created.

===message:Humans may be able to produce enough food for themselves already but if we can icrease the yield per plant perhaps the impact by farming on the environment may be reduced.  Now to further this possible goal we may also engineer plants which are resistant to pests but with Bt perhaps a bad choice was made.  An agent that kills such a large swath of the insect population will almost surely cause a great impact.  Also the amount of the protein that is produced may need to somehow be regulated.  With further study we may begin to more fully understand the process of differentiation in early development.  It may be possible to restrict the Bt protein to the vulnerable areas of the plant or to simply remove it from the widely dispersed pollen.  Sadly the goal of reduced impact may not be the goal of the seed companies.  Their goal is probably a better profit but with an open discussion maybe the seed companies would be forced to follow goals more harmonius with the people with a little economic pressure.

I think that this could only help man by making it possible to do away with chemicals as a means for getting rid of pests such as insects or weeds, etc.  Also, the plants will be able to produce food in conditions they would not normally be able to survive in.  This would provide both financial support for those areas struggling from poverty as well as a assistance in starvation situations.  There seem to be endless opportunities for the GM crops to help mankind in several ways.

===message:I believe that GM crops are a good idea, but we need to do more research before implementing drastic genetic changes.  Its always good to reduce and eliminate the need for pesticides and herbicides unless the means of doing this creates a bigger problem, as the article suggests.  GM crops need to be tested and refined until we know they are safe.  I do not believe that they are significant health risks, but they should undergo trials (much like prescription drugs) before they are introduced to the mainstream.  Even then, they should be clearly labeled so we have a choice and can avoid GM food if we wish.

===message:Hello Everyone.  I feel that GM crops are a problem and should be limited if not eliminated.  WE can all believe that the species of monarchs that are resistant will advance by natural selection and it won't be a problem anymore.  However, we have to think of how long we want to keep weeding out those individuals of species that are less fit.  Sooner or later we might end up being the ones selescted against.  However, I guess I am setting a double standard since from an economic point of view they are helpful and we also need to realize that we need to produce more food to handle the increase in world population.  
In the end I don't like them but I think we have to accept them as a neccesary evil which has to be allowed as the world "advances."

Inorder to do this we will need to become more efficient in our crop production.  GMOs are one of the answers to increasing crop production.  Much more testing needs to be done on GMOs.  We should have no tolerance for things we create that destory or harm other species.  Further testing needs to be done on all genetically modified organisms to see how they affect other organisms.
