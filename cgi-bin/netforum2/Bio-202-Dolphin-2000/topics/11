Study Questions

1. Name at least two differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. 
2. Make a list of all of the organelles that you would expect to find in a plant cell. Write one or two sentence description of their functions. How would an animal cell differ from a plant cell? 
3. Describe the path through various organelles that a protein takes as it is synthesized, modified and finally secreted by a cell. 
4.Describe how lysosomes function in the digestion of materials in food vacuoles. 
5. How do chloroplasts and mitochondria differ from other organelles found in cells? 
6. What proteins are important building units in the cytoskeleton?
7. How do flagella differ from cilia? 
8. Compare the cell walls of plants to the extracellular matrix of animal cells and indicate important differences.
9. Describe how membranes are important in defining the structure of a cell and its cytoplasm. Define compartmentalization. 
10. What role do proteins play in cell structure? What is the role of lipids?
