Study Help: 

A study guide is available on the WWW at http://www.biology.iastate.edu  Click on Course Materials, then Biology 202.  These guides include the terms that I expect you to know and questions about the topics to be covered.
Biosoftware, only available though the campus Appletalk network,  on the Darwin server in the Bessey Micro Fac Local zone will have Powerpoint copies of all of my lectures and some study aids mentioned in class. 
Katie Bock will be the supplemental instructor for this class with weekly sessions to be announced. 

Weekly Assignments 

Extra Credit: On Classnet, there is a discussion topic called Extra Credit Inquiries. Students posting thoughtful questions about science topics covered in lecture will receive an extra credit point for each question up to a maximum of 5. I will post answers to the questions in a timely fashion.   

  1.	By Jan. 14, register for this class on ClassNet at http://classnet.cc.iastate.edu   1pt
  2.	By Jan. 19, draw structures of glucose (ring), valine, serine, and palmitic acid.  Indicate molecular weights and whether each molecule is hydrophilic or hydrophobic.  Submit in class on 1/19.  6 pts
  3.	By Jan. 31, complete worksheet on energy relations in metabolism.  Submit in class.  5 pts
  4.	By February 9, transcribe and translate the 30 nucleotide DNA sequence I give you into a protein.  Indicate whether the beginning of the protein is hydrophilic or hydrophobic.  Submit in class.  5 pts
  5.	By February 14 read essay on genetically modified crops and post opinion on ClassNet.  You may respond to others postings for extra points.  3 pts + up to 2 pts
  6.	By February 21, find out how many base pairs are found in a human HIV virus isolated from Burkina Faso, an Australian with AIDS.  To do this, open Netscape, and under File menu, highlight 	Open Location.  Type http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov into the query box.  When the National Center or Biotechnology Information homepage appears, enter the name Faso in the query box and then hit go. On the next page to appear, click on display all.  Scan to entry  # AF064699.  Open the GenBAnk report and scan to the sequence for the HIV genome.  Submit to CLassNet the total number of base pairs and the last four bases found in the HIV genome.  4 pts. 
  7.	By February 28, use Biological Abstracts in ISU Library to locate an abstract of a scientific paper written about plant root hairs in the last two years.  Read the abstract, xerox or print it, write your name on it, and submit in class.  4 pts
  8.	By March 6, run photosynthesis simulation and answer questions on worksheet which will be given out in class.  Submit in class.  5 pts
  9.	By March 27, locate a WWW site describing a respiratory disease.  Post a short summary and the URL for the site on ClassNet.  3 pts
10.	By April 3,  locate a WWW site reporting on some aspect of immunological research.  Post a brief summary of the site and the URL on ClassNet.  3 pts
11.	By April 10,  locate a site on the WWW that has a picture of synapse or a myoneural junction.  Post the URL for the site on ClassNet.  3 pts
12.	By April 17, run action potential simulation and answer questions about threshold and refractory period.  Submit in class.  5 pts
13.	By Apr 21:  Read a paper in a primary scientific journal that publishes research reports about animal 	physiology.  Give me a full citation for the paper (use format in App D of Lab Manual), and in your own words, tell me what the paper is about.  Include what you got out of reading this paper.  Submit in class.  10 pts	
14.Unannounced quizzes could be given anytime during the semester.  When attendance is low, those attending will earn an additional point.  Up to 10 pts
