Metabolism Problem Set for Biology 202-Dolphin

1. Protein (and enzyme) structure result from complex chemical bonds that include two types: covalent and hydrogen bonds. In a peptide bond, where the carbon of a carboxyl group covalently bonds to the nitrogen of an amino group on another amino acid, the bond strength is on the order of 70,000 calories per mole. When hydrogen bonds develop between R groups on amino acids, the typical bond strength is about 5,000 calories per mole. 
When you heat proteins, as in boiling or frying an egg, the protein is denatured, i.e. its three dimensional structure changes because bonds in the original structure are broken. Which types of bonds are most likely broken during denaturation?

 
2. Glucose has a molecular weight of 180. A gram molecular weight (= 1 mole) contains how many molecules of glucose? 


3. When a mole of glucose reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water , the exergonic reaction releases 686,000 calories of free energy. When a mole of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) combines with a mole of phosphate to produce a mole of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the endergonic reaction requires 7,300 calories of free energy.
Theoretically, how many ATP molecules could be made if the breakdown of a mole of glucose were somehow coupled with the synthesis of ATP?




4. During aerobic metabolism of a mole of glucose (free energy = 686,000 calories/mole) in a cell, measurements show that 38 moles of ATP (free energy = 7,300 calories/mole) are made through complex coupled reactions (glycolysis, Kreb's cycle, electron transport system). 
In per cent, what is the efficiency of aerobic respiration, i.e. what per cent of the energy in glucose is captured in ATP? 




What happens to the energy that is not captured in ATP?  

5. In the digestion of proteins, the hydrolysis of a peptide bond releases about 2,200 calories of energy. The addition of a phosphate group to ADP to make ATP requires 7,300 calories of energy, both on a mole basis.  
How many moles of ATP can be made from the breakdown of a mole of peptide bonds (think a moment about this one)?





6. Humans have the following approximate daily energy requirements: sleeping 1,000 calories/hr/kg, relaxing 2,000 calories/hr/kg, normal activity 4,000 calories/hr/kg, and running 10,000 calories/hr/kg. Assuming a female student, who is a distance runner, weighs 50 kg and follows this daily schedule:
Sleeping 		8 hours
Normal activity 	10 hours
Relaxing 		4 hours
Jogging/running	 2 hours 

How many calories will she burn in a day? 




How many moles of ATP does she consume in a day? 





How many molecules of ATP does this represent?
