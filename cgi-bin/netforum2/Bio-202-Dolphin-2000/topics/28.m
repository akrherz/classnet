===message:Cytsic fibrosis is a genetic disorder.  It affects chloride uptake, causing abnormally thick mucus, which in turn affects the functions of most major organs.  With modern treatments, the greatest threat to the life of a CF patient is the respiratory impairment caused by the mucus, which not only directly blocks intake of air, but also harbors bacteria which can cause recurring respiratory infections.  This article discusses a protein, CFTR, which may hold the key to treatment of CF patients.

Emphysema is a degenerative disease developing after years of cigarette smoking.  The toxins in the cigarettes destroy the air sacs in the lungs, or alveoli, which stretch as they carry oxygen from the air to the blood and then shrink as they force out carbon dioxide.  As a result, the lungs lose their elasticity and exhaling becomes difficult.

It progresses through three stages.  The first stage, called "early infection," is where bacteria lodge in the lungs and the body forms a tubercle as an immune response.  This stage often heals without being noticed or might be passed off as a "cold or flu".  The second stage called "Dormant TB," is the dormant stage where germs may be widespread throughout the body, but don't cause any symptoms.  The third stage causes sores in the lungs and other parts of the body.  It is referred to as "Active TB".  Antibiotics can be used to treat TB, but there is a resistant strain of TB that is developing due to improper use of antibiotics.

Because the cilia isn't functioning, infection can develop.  Mucus forms and causes the coughing usually associated with bronchitis.  Bronchitis can be caused by a virus, bacteria, smoking, and breathing chemical pollutants or dust.  If the symptoms of bronchitis are ignored or are not treated, it can turn into acute bronchitis and then chronic bronchitis.  Acute bronchitis can be caused by a severe cold and can last for 10 days.  Attention for this disease is required so that further spreading of the disease down the bronchi and into the alveoli sacs is stopped.  Chronic bronchitis is when there is an excess of mucus secreted into the bronchi.  Coughing can last up to 3 months and the disease occurs year after year.  The bronchial layer thickens and the airway is narrowed, making breathing difficult.  The bronchial passages are more susceptible to more infections and tissue damage.  Cigarette and marijuana smoking have been found to the the chief causes of chronic broncitis.  Other causes are untreated acute bronchitis and the inhalation of pollutants.

     Tobacco smoke and other pollutants are thought to cause the release of chemicals within the air sacs of the lung that damage the walls of the air sacs. The damage becomes worse over time, affecting the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs. More info: http://www.emphysema.net

===message:http://www.acf.org.au/respir.htm
Smoking can cause many respiratory diseases.  Such diseases like emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which are known as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD).  23% of smokers will die from emphysema and chronic bronchitis.  Most often then not, these two diseases occur at the same time in humans.  Emphysema cannot be cured.  The best way to help it is to stop smoking because smoking more just makes it worse.  
Smoking damages the lungs of humans.  The tiny hairs in the lungs that protect against infections are damaged, the airways narrow, and carbon dioxide gets in the blood.  Most smokers get some dose of emphysema, either it be extremely bad or minor.  They can live for several years after being diagnosed, but it is not pleasent.

===message:Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that is often accompanied by sudden attacks of constricted airway. People who have asthma exhibit almost continually inflamed bronchial tubes, which make it hard to breathe normally. When an attack occurs, the air passages become extremely inflamed and clogged with thick secretions. A few factors that may trigger asthma symptoms include: dust, pollen, cold air, smoke, airbourne molds, exercise, air pollutants, and stress. Asthma is treated in two ways. Relief of symptoms often involves the use of inhalers to deliver beta-agonist medications to help relax the smooth muscle of the airways. Prevention of attacks utilizes anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids and non-steroid anti-inflammatories. These are also delivered by inhalers.

===message:www.lung.ca/pneumonia:  
    Pneumonia is the inflammation or infection of the lungs. Air sacs fill with pus, mucus, or other liquid, which makes it difficult for the lungs to function. Oxygen can't reach the blood, so body cells can't function either. Pneumonia can be lobar, when it affects a section or lobe of the lung, or bronchial, when it affects patches in both lungs. There are over thirty cause of pneumonia, including bacterial, viral, and mycoplasma. 
  Bacterial pneumonia attacks all ages, but children under 2 and adults over 65 are more likely to get the illness. The most commom cause of it is the bacterium Pneumucoccus, which cause the formation of pneumococcal pneumonia. It occurs in the lobar state, caused by the entrance of bacteria in the lung. The air sacs inflame and tissues of the lobes become filled with liquid matter. Infection spreads through the bloodstream and affects the entire body. Symptoms include cough, chest pain, chills, high temperature. Bacterial pneumonia is the only form with a vaccine available.
  Viral pneumonia is caused by primary influenza virus pneumonia, which invades the lungs and multiplies. Flu-like symptoms occur along with breathlessness.
  Mycoplasma pneumonia affects all ages as well. It possesses characteristics of both bacterial and viral. This type rarely causes death. Other kinds of pneumonia are caused by the inhalation of food, liquid, gases, dirt, or foreign bodies. It may also be caused by a bronchial obstruction, such as a tumor. 
  A quick recovery will more quickly occur if a person is young, it is diagnosed early, the immune system is in good condition, infection hasn't spread, and there are no other illnesses present at the time.

===message:The Anthrax disease is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a gram positive, non-motile, spore-forming rod.  The disease can occur in three forms depending on how the bacteria infects the body.  Diseases caused by bacteria entering through skin breaks or ingestion of infected meats can lead to serious infections, but both can be treated if caught early.  However, if the diseases is contracted through inhalation of the bacteria or its spores, death is almost certain within 2-5 days.  When B. anthracis is inhaled, the symptoms of a common cold usually arise within a day or so.  This is followed by the development of severe breathing problems and sometimes shock, both leading to a quick death.  There is a very small chance for stoping the infection if it is diagnosed and treated exteremely early, but because the disease occurs almost exclusively in underdeveloped countries of middle and south america, the middle east, asia, and africa, such diagnosis is unlikely.  The respiratory form of anthrax is commonly known due to the fact that B. anthracis is one of the most feared organisms for use in biological weapons.  Aside from such weapons, the organism is usually contracted by those working with or around rural areas where the bacteria may be present in infected animals or its spores in the soil.

The disease cystic fibrosis used to be known as a childhood disease, but now the median age of people with the disease is 28 years.  Cystic fibrosis is genetic, resulting in a mutation of the delta F-508 gene.  This gene was discovered in 1989.  There is about 20,000 people with the disease in the US.  There are several target organs in the body that cystic fibrosis effects; the pancreas, the intestinal glands, biliary glands, bronchial tubes and sweat glands.  The mutation of the gene  results in the lack of an essential protein that makes a cell unable to funnel out chloride ions in the body.  As a result, in the lungs, a thick mucus builds up.  The mucus is mostly composed of bacteria, the stuff already in mucus and dead white blood cells.  It is believed that the dead white blood cells and their DNA is the main reason why the air pathways clog.  However, there is medicine to help reduce the symptoms.  Research has also shown that the mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is resistant to cholera, a bacteria that causes diarrhea.

There is a lack of alpha-1 antitrypsin production by the liver.  Normally this is released in the bloodstream and provides protection to the lungs.  With suboptimal levels, neutrophil elastase is free to damage lungs.  Smoking is not necessary to have emphysema that is due to this protein deficiency.  If you have ever talked to anyone that has said they have emphysema and have never smoked in their life, this could be the cause.  If a person does smoke, the disease progresses even faster.  With smoking, the body makes more white blood cells to protect the lungs, which increases neutrophil elastase levels resulting in even more lung damage at a faster rate.

With pneumonia oxygen is inhibited from reaching blood because of flood build up in the lungs.  Virsuses and bacteria are the causes of fluid build up.  And can affect anyone of all ages.  Many people can protect themselves from getting pneumonia by recieving vaccinations.  But some people will recieve outbreaks from the vaccinations.

===subject:Emphysema
===message:Emphysema is a degenerative disease that occurs after years of assult on lung tissue.  The most common cause of this disease is smoking and can also be caused by long term inhalation of other air pollutants and chemicals.  Emphysema causes a decrease in lung elasticity b/c the alveoli, which transport oxygen from the air to the blood and then shrink as they force out carbon dioxide, are destroyed. Exhaling becomes difficult with the lungs not able to effectively exchange air in the lungs with fresh air.  Emphysema is also reffered to as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
	Lung tests acan be administered in the determination of Emphysema.  These test include, Spirometry, Arterial Blood Gas (ABG), Pulso Oximetry, and X-ray.  X-Ray is not helpful in early stages of diagnosis.  This information can be found at http://healthexcite.com/content/dmk/dmk_article_39610809.

The most useful way of preventing pneumonia is with an influenza vaccination.  The pneumococcal vaccination is a good protector against pneumococcal pneumonia.  An antibiotic treatment for high respiratory tract infection does not prevent pneumonia in children.  Pneumonia is caused by a virus, and antibiotics indicate only if there is likely to be a second bacterial infection.  Since pneumonia is caused by a bacteria, antibiotics are useful.

                               Emphysema is a respiratory ailment in which the air sacs in the lungs, aveoli, are severly damaged.  This distruction of these air sacs leads to shortness of breath and tiredness even after tasks as simple as walking up a flight of stairs.
One of the effects emphysema has is hadening of the lungs. This is one of the main reasons why patients have a hard time breathing because the lungs are no longer elastic enough to expell air.  Because of this one of the treatments for the disease is to simply have those suffering from it strengthen their diaphram and abdominals which are muscles used in breathing.  Other treatments include prescription drugs and oxygen treatments.

RSV is a major respiratory illness in young children.  In children and adults three and older symptoms are usually similar to those of the "common cold," stuffy/runny nose, sore throat, mild headache, mild cough, and low-grade fever.  In children younger than three, it mainly causes bronchiolitis and pneumonia.  This may lead to respiratory failure.  The symptoms usually include high fever, severe cough, wheezing, rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, and bluish color of lips and fingernails.  Infants withs severe RSV often have abnormal retrations of the muscles between the ribs.

The disease targets the air sacs in lungs which allow oxygen to flow into the bloodstream and allow carbon dioxide to leave the body. Eventually inflation of the lungs occurs which hampers a person's ability to breathe, and becomes a fatal. There is hope for a cure, in a special type of surgery called lung-volume-reduction-surgery. This technique removes parts of the infected lung in a way that the rest of the respiratory system can function at a better rate. Currently, this surgery is only performed on people with advanced emphysema, not any other respiratory diseases.

cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease in which transport of 
Na and Cl with epithelial cells, which line organs such as 
the lungs and the pancreas, to their outer surfaces is 
defective.  the effect of this defect is that the body 
produces mucus that is abnormally thick and sticky.  this 
mucus does not function properly in aiding the removal of 
antigens from the body, and is difficult to dislodge from
the lungs and respiratory pathways.  in addition, the mucus
interferes with the function of the pancreas, obstructing it
and preventing enzymes produced by the pancreas from 
reaching the intestines.  this results in poor digestion and
nutrient absorption.  treatment of this disease includes 
postural drainage (aka chest physical therapy), which 
involves pounding the back and chest of the CF victim
several times a day to dislodge the thick mucus from their
lungs and trachea/bronchal tubes, and also antibiotics and 
nutrient/vitamin/enzyme supplements.  however, although
research has advanced substantially since the disease was
first discovered in 1989, CF is a fatal disease: there is no
cure. the median age of survival for a person with CF is 31
years.

It is caused by organic and inorganic dust, gas fumes, in rare cases;antibiotics, radiation, residue from an infection, Lupus, and Rheumatiod arthritis.  The pattern ILD takes is usually an injury, followed by inflammation that spreads to the alveoli, then fibrosis of interstitium and the lung stiffening.  It can be treated with medication and can be removed if caught early.

===message:Emphysema is a disease in which the air sacs in the lungs are damaged or destroyed.  It is an irreversible condition and leads to poor exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air in the lungs and the bloodstream.  Causes of emphysema have been related to smoking, air pollution and occupational exposure.  It can be characterized by fatigue and shortness of breath.

===message:Respriatory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the common cause of bronchiolitis and pneunomonia among children under one year of age.  RSV begins with symptoms of fever, runny nose, cough, and occasional wheezing.  Up to 40% of the children show symptoms of bronchitis or pneunomia and 2% require hospitalization.  The RSV can also cause infections repeatedly during life.  
  RSV is an RNA virus and is variable in shape and size.  It is unstable in environment and is inactivated with soap and water.  It is spread in respiratory secretions.  Contact with mucus of eyes, mouth, nose, and sneezing can cause infections.  For mild cases no specific treatment is used but treatment of the symptoms helps.  If there is a severe case there may be a need for oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.  Development of of a vaccine is being researched but is not yet available.  To prevent infections wash hands frequently and do not share eating utensils.

Chronic Bronchits affects about 5% of Americans.  This disease is characterized by a cough  that continues for three months of a year or for two years without any known pathogenic cause.  Commonly brochitis is a precursor to emphesyma.  Bronchitis is comoonly caused by overexposure to dust or smoke.</text>

===subject:Pneumonia
===message:Pneumonia is a serious infection or inflammation of your lungs.  It is caused by the filling up of the air sacs with pus or liquid.  Because of this blockage, oxygen has trouble reaching the blood-and without enough oxygen the cells can not work properly.  There are over 30 causes of pneumonia.  The top five causes are bacteria, viruses, mycoplasmas, pneumocystis, and various chemicals.  Common symptoms of pneumonia are the chills, severe chest pain, and a heavy cough that produces rust-colored or green mucus.  Within 12-36 hours of these signs pneumonia can cause a high fever, muscle pain, weakness, and an increase in breathlessness.  In order for pneumonia to be treated, the patient needs to report these signs early, otherwise it can be difficult to overcome, and actually can end up resulting in death because of the infection overtaking the body.  http://www.lungusa.org/diseases/lungpneumoni.html

It is a disease that could affect a person every day, or only occasionally.  It affects more than 14 million people in the United States alone.  It is not known what causes asthma, but it must be treated in order for a victim to lead a normal and productive life.  There have been some recent advances against asthma, but no cure has been found.  If untreated, it can cause death.

This article addresses the fact that mine workers had to form unions to prevent being taken advantage of. One major reason for this was the pressing issue of health. Workers would develop black lung due to the accumulation of coal dust in their lungs. This would prevent the exchanging of gases to take place. The article states the different kinds of Black Lung Disease: Simple and Complicated, as well as their corresponding stages. </text>

===message:Emphysema is the fourth largest cause of mortality in the U.S., yet it is not a highly publicized disease and , consequently, little is known about it by the average citizen. Almost 16-30 million U.S. citizens are afflicted with emphysema... and every year approximately 100,000 sufferers die of the disease. Smoking is the major cause, but with ever increasing air pollution and other environmental factors that negatively impact pulmonary patients, those numbers are on the rise. There is no denying it, we must continue our work to reduce the suffering and the toll emphysema is taking.

===message:I looked at the american Lung association website. In here I looked at the effects of Lung emphysema. I saw that this disease is related with long time consume of tobacco products. This diseases destroys the alveoli in the lungs causing more difficulty in breathing because there are less alveoli carring out the gas exchange. It gets to the point that this person cannot carry out enough respiration and as it gets worse more complications occur.

Hyaline Membrane Disease (aka Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is a disease that affects newborn babies, especially those born prematurely.  It is caused by a lack of pulmonary surfuctant in the alveoli, a substance that reduces surface tension in the alveoli.  Without this substance the alveoli collapse at the end of every respiration, resulting in respiratory failure in the newborn.
