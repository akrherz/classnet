There you will find a nice big picture of a synapse, but you can view it 2 different ways-300 dpi or 72 dpi. I chose the 72 dpi image because that was big enough. It is a nice picture.

===message:On the Harvard Medical School web page one can find a slide of a myoneural juction.  In the slide you can see the braching of the neuron until it reaches the terminal bud. Below each terminal bud on the muscle fiber it is associated with you can see the motor end plate (circled in the slide).  Various neural chemicals pass from terminal bud to end motor plate, creating communication between the neron and the muscle, and ultimately the brain.

This page shows a myoneural junction in a muscle.  In synapse the neuron "speaks" to the muscle fiber via chemical mediators which cross the synaptic cleft between the two cells.
