Study Questions
1. In simple terms describe transcription and translation, indicating how they are related to each other in the synthesis of a protein.
2. Describe how a gene that is made of nucleic acid can contain the information necessary to make a protein made of amino acids.
3. Why is messenger RNA called a transcript of gene? How does a codon differ from a whole mRNA? Is mRNA a protein? What is its relationship to a protein? Describe how mRNA is made in a cell? What is an exon? An intron? Why are they important?
4. Estimate how many different types of tRNAs are found in a cell? Does each one bind to a different amino acid? Where is the anticodon on the tRNA? What is its function?
5. Describe how codons and anticodons interact? Why is this important?
6. Describe how ribosomes, mRNA, and tRNA with their associated amino acids interact during initiation, elongation, and termination in protein synthesis.
7. If a gene has AAA at the fifth position, what tRNA anticodon would bind at the fifth position of the mRNA made from this gene? Draw it out, do not guess. What amino acid would consequently be positioned at the fifth position?
8. Sit down with a friend and describe how a protein is made by a cell using a transcript of a gene.
9. Why does the synthesis of some proteins start with a signal sequence? 
10. Insulin is a protein synthesized by the beta cells of the pancreas. Using you knowledge of protein synthesis, describe all of the steps from the time the gene becomes active until the protein is secreted.
