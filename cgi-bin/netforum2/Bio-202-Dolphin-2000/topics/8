Study Questions

1. What are eight general functions of proteins in cells? 
2. Describe how an amino acid differs from a sugar?
3. Describe how an amino acid differs from a fatty acid?
4. What are the differences between a protein, polypeptide and an amino acid?
5. Draw the structure of two amino acids, serine and valine. What is the difference? Which one would you predict is hydrophilic? Which one hydrophobic? Why? 
6. Redraw the structure of the two amino acids in #3 and show how a peptide bond would form between them. 
7. All proteins are made of the same 20 amino acids. How can there be so many different types of proteins in nature? How does one type of protein differ from another? 
8. What causes proteins to have unique shapes, and why is shape important? 
9. Explain why proteins are considered to be polymers. 
10. Are nucleic acids polymers? Explain. 
11. What are the functions of nucleic acids in cells?
