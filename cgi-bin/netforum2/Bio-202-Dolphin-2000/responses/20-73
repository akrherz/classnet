===message:I agree.  People say they are so worried about the planet.  What they should be saying is they are worried about them selves.  Earth will not fall off its axis and cease to exist because of GM Foods.  Humans may destroy what they need to live, but a planet is pretty hard to destroy.  I just think people shouldn't make their 'preserving the world' sound so noble when all they are doing is saving human's and what ever else we need to keep reproducing.

===message:You ended your message with, "Will we never be satisfied."  GM Crops are just another way humans are trying to make life easier and with a little more research and application a better place.  With out the innate drive to explore and discover we possess as humans we would still be living in cold dark caves.

===message:I agree with you.  I think it is painfully obvious that some 
of the motivations for GMOs include saving time and money.  
I think we should first be certain that there are no ill 
effects from this process.  Shouldn't we be concerned that 
we may be eating something which could affect us negatively 
in the long run?  Or that we may be hurting our environment?  
I think more research needs to be done.  Genetic 
modification may prove to be extremely beneficial for 
everyone, but I think we should be certain of this before we 
proceed.

===message:I agree with your idea that nature will soon retaliate against our constant attempts to " better" our lives.  I don't agree with the fact that the way we have played with technology before has worked out the way we planned.  I refuse to believe that human kind forsaw the coming of the ozone layer depletion, or the coming of runoff from the use of pesticides on crops.  The price of convience has proven to harm the ecosystem time and time again.  There is no reason to believe that this time there won't be negative effects to GM crops.
