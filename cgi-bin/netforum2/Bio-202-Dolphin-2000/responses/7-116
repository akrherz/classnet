===message:New leaves form at new locations. Take a careful look at a twig on a tree on campus. You will see where last year's leaves were attached by finding a little crescent scar with several vascular bundle scars in it. Note no new leaves are forming there. All of the new leaves are forming at the tips of  the many little branches coming off a main branch.
