===message:If you hyperventilate, i.e. breathe in and out rapidly and deeply, you will drop the CO2 concentration in the blood. This can raise the blood pH because CO2 is carried as H2CO3 and HC03 ion which if removed causes alkalosis. Alkalosis leads to constriction of cerebral arterioles and blood flow to brain can be cut off. Breathing into a paper bag causes the person to rebreathe higher CO2 levels than in air and restores carbonate balance. Because respiratory rate is also governed by CO2 concentration in the blood, breathing rate will increase as you breathe and rebreathe air from a bag. You may hyperventilate as a result, but you are hyperventilating air that is CO2 enriched and it does not have the same effect as hyperventilating fresh air.
