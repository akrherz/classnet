===message:I sounds like your option for fixing the problem with genetically modified crops is to change the name and do nothing else. you believe that higher yields result from a changein the genetics. This statement is only partly true. For example, plants today are modified by corn breeding, where the pollen from one corn hybrid is mixed with the silk of another type of hybrid and then bagged. There are many farmers that do not agree with this statement, and will do anything in their power to stop those kinds of mixtures without even realizing that they plant the results. Changing the name of something will not necessarily change the people's response to the new hybrid lines. They need to be proven to be safer and less harmful to the environment. 

As for the idea of feeding the world, what about all of the corn stores that go to waste in storage just because the US is unwilling to sell/give it away to countries that need it. That is part of the reason why farmers get sch a low sell rate on corn and go bankrupt. The leftover corn in storage lowers the value of the corn. A higher yeild will only harm the farm economy and cause more farmers to go in debt and loose their farms. 

The new genetically modified crops should at least be studied more and made safer. This may help to lessen the fear against the crops and to create a bigger market (baby food companies, Europe, ect.)
