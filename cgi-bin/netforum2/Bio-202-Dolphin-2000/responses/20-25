===message:	GM crops do have their problems, but as we see in the article these problems are being researched as we speak.  Besides we can't simply discontinue research on something because it is controversial.  Abortion, gay rights, and cloning are all controversial yet they are still debated and researched.  Perhaps GM crops will someday provide the necessary increased yields to feed our rapidly growing population.  Research in this field needs to continue.  Only through continued research can we find answers to the problems posed by GM crops and possibly diminish starvation throughout the world in years to come.

===message:I agree that there are many faults to be found in GM crops, but I don't think that we can totally discontinue their use until further research is completed.  Also, it is hard to base a fair opinion of them based on one article.  We have to take into account that the attitude in the argument of this article is against GM crops.  Because of this, many other aspects of research may have been left out that would have supported the opposing view of the article.  It is not fair to deny what may be a beneficial discovery to the entire world, based on the findings of one article.
