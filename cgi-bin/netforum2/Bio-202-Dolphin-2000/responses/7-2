===message:Amino acids when bonded together to form peptides, can be broken apart by breaking the peptide bonds between amino and carboxyl groups of different amino acids. THe type of reaction that breaks these bonds is called a hydrolysis reaction and it is catalysed by different enzymes. For example, peptidase in our guts is such an enzyme that causes the hydrolysis of the proteins we eat yielding amino acids that we absorb and use.
