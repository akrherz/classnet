===message:Lungs do collapse for reasons that I do not know, but it is not normal. It may be due to insufficient amounts of surfactant so that the surface tension in the lungs is greater than normal and the alveoli completely collapse. There are medical procedures for restoring collapsed lung but I am not certain what they are. It is possible to live with a single lung, but activity is impaired. The one lung must be inflatd twice as much as allow for the oxygen exchange that a pair of lungs normally performs or the person must use oxygen-supplemented air.
