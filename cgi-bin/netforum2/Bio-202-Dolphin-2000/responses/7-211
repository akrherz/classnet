===message:I am not that familiar with the effects of steroids on the kidney and liver and cannot explain the side effects in detail. However, you state that because it is natural, you wonder why all of the effects are not good. Steroid hormones penetrate into cells and enter the nucleus where they directly affect genes. The amount of steroid hormone normally in the blood is regulated by feedback mechanisms that keep them at low levels so that certain genes are only expressed at low levels. When you artificially raise the levels, you are artificially changing gene expression. If a person believes that they can improve on several million years of natural selection, then they might want to tinker with their hormone levels. This might lead to certain effects considered desirable by the person doing the  tinkering, but what about the side effects? THe one thing that we know about natural selection is that it works on the total phenotype. To that extent, if the tinkering behavior is beneficial and geneticly determined, I would expect the behavior to increase in the population. If it is not, I would expect it to decrease due to the tinkering phenotype failing the test of natural selection, i.e. those people do not function as well and leave fewer offspring because they get sick and die.
