===message:YOu are describing the results of a test for visual acuity using a Snellen test chart with lines of type of different sizes which is read from a distance of 20 feet. A person with 20/20 in one eye can read the line most people can read at 20 feet. If a subject standing at 20 feet from the chart can only read what most normal people read from 40 feet then the person has 20/40 vision. This would not be better vision than normal. I presume that some people might test 10/20 which says they can read at 20 feet what others can only see at 10. This would be better visual acuity. However, I think the angle of view goes down when this happens and people do not have normal field of view although they can see greater detail in the narrowed field. Is this better vision? Depends. It would be harder to do athletics, to drive a car, or to be aware of what is happening around you without constantly moving your head or eyes.
