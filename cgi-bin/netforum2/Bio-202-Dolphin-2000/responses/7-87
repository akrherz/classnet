===message:This is a confusing use of terminology. We usually think of cells as living when they function but this is not always the case. Skin "cells" at the surface are dead and filled with the protein keratin that gives us a good protective wrap against invasion and fluid loss. Botanists refer to xylem as cells, yet when xylem is functional only the cell wall remains as a conduction conduit, i.e. a pipe. Think of it as the protoplasts function is to make a cell wall. The cell wall could not be made by other means. When the wall is complete the protoplast dies and leaves the structure that it made in place. The cell walls exist for long periods of time. WHat is the age of the oldest tree: thousands of years. However the xylem made a thousand years ago is probably plugged with resins and salts and no longer conducts. Only the most recently made xylem is functioning in conduction in plants that old. WHen the protoplast dies, it lyses and probably adjacent cells absorb the molecules that are released, but I am not absolutely sure of this.
