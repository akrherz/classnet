===message:All neuron cell bodies are in the CNS. Axons of motor nerves extend out to the extremities as well as  do dendrites for sensory nerves. In the CNS there are many cell bodies that do not send axons and dendrites out to peripheral body parts. Instead, their axons and dendrites extend to other parts of the CNS. The circuits are in the CNS among these cells and the peripheral inputs/outputs. Rough analogy: think of the CNS as a computer. You can connect your computer to the peripheral nervous system by hooking it up to the internet and various peripheral devices such as a printer, scanner, etc.
