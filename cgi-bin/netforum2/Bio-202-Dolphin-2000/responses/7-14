===message:I do not think that viruses should be classified as organisms. They are not capable of independent existence because they essentially are a genetic system without a metabolic system. This is not to say that we should not have a way of identifying them because this is most useful in the treatment of diseases as well as in genetic engineering. I just don't consider them organisms. 


All viruses do not pick up pieces of the host cell DNA. A group which does not do this is called the virulent viruses. They enter a cell, make the cell manufacture virus parts and then the cell lyses releasing new viruses. Another group of viruses called temperate viruses will invade a cell and insert into the host cell's DNA. There the DNA will quietly sit for a long time without affecting the host cell. If the host cell were to divide, the viral DNA is replicated as if it were host cell DNA and it is distributed to daughter cells as is it were host cell DNA. At a later time, the viral DNA can activats and take over any cell that it is in (whether it directly invaded the cell or was passed through cell division) and can direct the host cell to make viral parts. The parts assemble and the cell then lyses releasing viruses.
