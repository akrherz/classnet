===message:Damage to tissues as in a brusise, cut or infection causes cells to release a substance called histamine. HIstamines incresse capillary dilation and cause them to become "leaky." MOre fluid leaves the capillaries and enters the interstitial spaces. THe lymph capillaries cannot remove it as fast as it leaves, hence it accumulates and swells. Swelling further blocks lymphatic drainage. INterestingly, histamines are released in the nasal sinus when you have a cold or allergy. Increased cipillary leakage leads to mucous release by cells and congestion. Can you guess at the effect of "antihistamines?
