===message:Your liver has an enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase which converts alcohol to acetate that enters the Krebs cycle. If you ingest alcohol on a regular basis the alcohol dehydrogenase level builds in the liver. If a person usually drinks unti they are high, this means that they drink more and more to reach the same end point. AS you conusume more and more alcohol levels inthe blood build, THis can kill some of the liver cells which are replaced by scar tissue that does not perform normal liver function. The liver will begin to enlarge even though it might not function well. Eventually,  you can die by liver failure. While all of this good stuff is happening, the person may develop a craving for alcohol and will get into alcoholic behavior patttern that usually does not result in success. Individual genetics probably accounts for the differences seen as well as diet just before alcohol ingestion. Fatty foods slow the absorption of alcohol.
