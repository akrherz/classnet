===message:I'm not too sure if it was the most interesting article that I have ever read on the subject but, I do agree with the American view.  I think that the Europeans may be taking percautions and all, but they may be taking it too far.  Although I didn't grow up in Iowa, I too feel for the farmers.

===message:I also agree with the idea that GM crops would benefit the farming industry.  Mainly because the farming industry is in a bit of a crisis.  Because the prices are extremely low, perhaps an increased yield in their crop production may boost up the amount of money they recieve after the sale.

===message:Joe,
 I would have to agree with your opinion, as I too thing that the benefits of GM crops are well worth the time and effort and should not be shun based on aligations.  I think that both the US and European associates with this concern need to do further study to really see the pros and cons of GM crops, but I am already looking at the positive side of it over the negative.  I didnt know that you knew so much about farming, coming from a community of a quarter of a million people. :-)

===message:I will have to agree with Joe on the issue of growing up in Iowa and having the agriculture community surronding me.  It would be a very hard descision for many farmers to make on if they should grow and even support the GM crops.  It could make their production better, but also could make them worse.  As said before there obviously needs to be more research on these type of GM crops.
