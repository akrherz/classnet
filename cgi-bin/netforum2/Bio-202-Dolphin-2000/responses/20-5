===message:I think the biggest problem that Bt crops currently face is the amount of public fear and ignorance that surrounds the technology.  Labeling of Bt crops should NOT be required; it provides an unfair hindrance to those farmers and corporations that have properly tested their products and have already proven them safe.  On the other hand, if producers of non-Bt crops want to advertise the fact that their product is non-Bt, that should be well within their rights as well.  (This is essentially the way that BGH in milk was handled).

===message:I do not consider myself overly liberal but the fear of hindering the producers of GM crops is not high on my priority list.  GM labelling should be as mandatory as nutrition information.  People have the right to know what they are eating.  If the idea of GM crops scares people then it scares people.  Companies and farmers will just have to take this into account when they choose what to plant in their fields.  I think Europe is on the right track as far as this issue is concerned.
