===message:The proteins that you refer to are called single strand stabilizing proteins. They will bind only with single strnaded DNA and will be displaced when it replicates and again becomes double stranded. I am not sure excactly how the displacement occurs, perhaps the DNA polymerase is able to push them off as it moves along the parental DNA strand. I assume that once released, they stay in the nucleus and may be used over at another site where the DNA is opening up and replicating. In a cell that is no longer dividing, say our brain cells, I think they must break down and are not synthesized again for the life of the cell. This, of course, leads to lots of intersting questions of how protein synthesis is regulated, which is really to say how is gene expression regulated.
