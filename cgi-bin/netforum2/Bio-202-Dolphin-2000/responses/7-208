===message:Speaking of nitrogen here as a N2, a gas, it must enter into organic chemical linkage to be used by plants and animals. Monerans are the only organisms that can do this. THe "problem" is that nitrogen is not very reactive. N2 atmospheres can be used to put out fires or protect steel from combining with oxygen during welding. It takes some special biochemistry to use nitrogen gas to make NH3 or nitrite or nitrate and this has evolved only in prokaryotes. Eukaryotes can use the hydrides and oxides of nitrogen to make organic molecules containing nitrogen, but depend on prokaryoters, lightingg, or volcanoes to make the starting material.
