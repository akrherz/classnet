===message:MAny animals have eyespots that do form an image. There is no lens to focus light, only light sensitve cells: sort of like a photocell on your patio light that turns the light on when it gets dark. Vertebrates and many invertebrates have image forming eyes. The difference can be easily demonstrated. You are reading this with image forming vision. CLose your eyes, but not too tightly. MOve your head so that your face scans around the room. Can you tell where the light that penetrates your eyelid is coming from? I would say that is equivalent to what a planarian or jellyfish "sees" with its eyes: just light areas and shadows of different degrees.
