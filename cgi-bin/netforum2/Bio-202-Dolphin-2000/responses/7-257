===message:Somebody knows this but I don't off the top of my head. Here is an experimental procedure to measure it.  You could measure it by looking at what needed to be replaced. Put the rat in a sealed container. Introduce and inlet and outlet. Send dry air in the inlet and collect air coming from outlet. Run it over pre-weighed anhydrous CaSO4. Do this for day. Reweigh the CaSO4. It will pick up the moisture in the air that the animal was breathing. The weight difference is the moisture lost through respiration. ALso have a screen floor in the container so any urine passes through. Measure the volume of urine. If the animal is weighed before and after the experiment and the food in the container was weighed before and after, by subtraction you can figure out amount of water absorbed from the air (lost by the animal), whether the animal stayed in a constant state of hydration (its before/after weight), and how much food it ate (the metabloic input). You should also test the food itself for moisture apart from metabolic water which it generates in the rat.
