===message:I used PKU as an example of mutation. For a person who has PKU, the actually problem could be at one or more of several levels. ----If there was a frameshift mutation caused by the addition or deletion of a nucleotide in the coding section of the gene, a mRNA and then a protein is produced that has very different amino acids than does the normal enzyme. A substitution mutation could have occurred so that one codon and therefore one amino acid is changed. If this was in the active site region, the enzyme could be non-functional. Either of the above types of mutations could occur in the control regions of the gene--in the promoter this might not allow mRNA synthesis to start so no mRNA is produced and no protein. You could have chromosomal breaks that occur in the gene so that is non-finctional and so on. THer is not one answer to your question because the disease may have multiple origins.
