===message:Proteins do not hop into and out of membranes. They are confined to the membrane because they have regions of hydrophobic amino acids that make it energetically unfavorable to leave the non-polar membrane environemtn and enter the polar aqueous environment of the inside or outside of the cell. However, they do move from side to side, i.e. they diffuse in two dimensions rather than three. Diffusion is not purposeful; it is simply the result of thermal motion of molecules. This movement is not then a mattter of advantage, it simply happens. 

Having said all of this, read the section on pino/phagocytosis in your text. In these processes, certain receptor molecules, proteins, can cluster in regions of a membrane that are internalized. Clustering is the opposite of diffusion, and one has to wonder how it happens. Could it involve the active participation of the underlying cytoskeleton?
