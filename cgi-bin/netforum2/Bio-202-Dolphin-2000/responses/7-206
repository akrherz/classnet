===message:The cells in small vessels and those lining the major vessels exchange materials with the blood they are carrying. The middle and outer layers of major vessels are supplied by minute vessels collectively called vasa vasorum that branch off smaller arteries and return the major arteries/veins where they penetrate the vessel wall to supply the needs of cells.
