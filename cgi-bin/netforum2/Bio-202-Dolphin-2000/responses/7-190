===message:It is not a matter of knowing. Vitamins are transported into cells and are reclaimed from the urine by transport mechanisms. If you ingest such large amounts of vitamins that the transport mechanisms are overwhelmed, the excess will show up in urine. Think of the blood as a conveyer belt on which there is food leading to a dumpster (kidneys). IMagine some people, the cells, sit and eat food from the conveyer belt to satisfy their needs. (everything is clean and nicely presented but nonetheless is on a conveyer belt) Once food passes the people it goes into the kitchen, where cooks try to reclaim it. If the belt has too much food on it they cannot reclaim all of it as the belt passes and some food goes to the dumpster despite the fact that it is good food. The reclaimers are simply overwhelmed. Shutting down the cponveyer is not an option because it it is the blood. I hope the analogy does not confuse you. Esentially you are looking at a kinetics situation: the rate of intake versus the rate of usage, versus the rate of reclamation from the kidney tubules versus the rate of output
