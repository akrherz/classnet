===message:Actually potatoes are stems that are specialized for storage. You might reason that they are roots because they are underground, store carbohydrate and are non-photosynthetic but if you follow the development of a potato it arises from a stem branch that pushes underground. THe give-away are the eyes. They are the axillary buds and in a freshly dug potatoe the leaves will be present as small scales.
