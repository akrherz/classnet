===message:Polio is caused by a very specific virus that attacks the central nervous system. A person who contracts polio cannot be treated; they will suffer the consequences of the disease. However, it can be avoided by taking a vaccine.  The surface of the virus has proteins on it and these serve as antigens. If the proteins are isolated from the virus (and it is not infective because no nucleic acid is present), they can be used to make a vaccine that can be  injected into humans who will make antibodies and memory cells against the proteins in the vaccine. If the person comes in contact with a polio virus, the memory cells mount a quick response and inactivate it before it cause any disease symptoms. This medical strategy works because the polio virus does not undergo mutations that change its surface proteins and because the virus that causes the disease is very specific. IN theory common colds could be avoided in the same way: note I said avoided not treated in much the same way polio is avoided and not treated by a vaccine. The problem is that the common cold is npt specific disease and is caused by many different types of viruses that invade the respiratory system and these virus are always mutating into new forms. Therefore, one vaccine does not work to give immunity. Each year you hear about this or that strain of flu (influenza) and that you should get a "shot." The shot is a vaccine made from proteins of the strain of influenza is thought to become epidemic in a given year. Each year the vaccine is different. Some viruses are able to hide from the immune system by entering cells and living there. When they exit the cell they often cover themselves with a piece of the host cell's membrane. The body "sees" the virus as "self," a wolf in sheep's clothing.
