===message:I complete agree the largest problem GM industry is facing right now is a rush to establish profits before assuring consumer confidence, and their own confidence, in their product.  GM crops have such a great potential to benefit us, but the way in which companies have gone about handling the introduction of these new products is poorly thoughtout.  It is not suprising that GM crops, being new and not well understood by the public, are going to raise significant controversy.  The corportations involved with GM science should realize this and takes steps to ensure consumers and growers of their products safety, rather than rushing to aquire profits before competitors do.  A few years ago, cancer research stumbled upon a few proteins that at first showed amazing ability to retard tumor growth in mice.  However, the media took pelimerary results and ran with them, creating a medical/media uproar over the new drugs.  Unfortunantly, little has come of the supposed wonder drugs since the story broke.  The same media phenomenon may be at work here.  If companies producing GM crops are careful and thorough in their development, their is a good chance that these products can benefit everyone.  However, the carelessness which such corporations appear to exhibit toward their products is creating a media stir and rapidly degrading consumer confidence.

===message:I agree.  GM crops are something that some people haven't even heard of yet. This is a very new topic and although the crops have been tested for short term effects, there has not been enough time to test for long term effects. In the next few years, people may be buying GM crops from grocery stores. But before then, science needs to be sure that these crops will be safe for the public.

===message:I agree with what you are saying (and very nicely written too!). I believe that GM crops can be helpful to not only humans, but the environment as well. When there has been much more research about the effects of genetic engineering, I will totally support GM crops.
