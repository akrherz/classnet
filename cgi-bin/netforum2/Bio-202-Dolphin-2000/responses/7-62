===message:You are correct in thinking glycolysis does not produce CO2. THe confusion comes in the words aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. ---Aerobic metabolism is a collection of reactions, glycolysis, acetyl shuttle, Krebs cycle, and the elctron transport system. Collectively, these reactions breakdown glucose while using oxygen to produce CO2 and H2O.----Anaerobic metabolism is also a collection of reactions, not just glycolysis. In anaerobic glycolysis produces pyruvate (as in aerobic), but the pyruvate is changed into something else before aerobic metabolism is complete. In bacteria and animal muscle, pyruvate is changed into lactic acid (lactate) and no CO2 is produced. In yeasts, it is changed into acetate. For this conversion, one carbon comes off as CO2. Therefore, in yeasts anaerobic metabolism yields
CO2, but not in other organisms. If this does not answer your question, talk to me in class.
