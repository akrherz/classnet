===message:THe Na/K pump that we talked about in cellualr trapsort back in February restores the ion concentration gradients in nerve cells. Thge actual number of ions that traverse the membrane during an action potential is small in comparison to the total amount, so the pump does not have to work hard under normal conditions. It is, however, possible to overstimulate a nerve and have it become "exhausted." This means that the pump is overwhelmed and cannot pump fast enough to restore the ion gradients needed for a resting and action potential. I do not think  that this is encountered frequently in normal life.
