===message:although there are some downsides to the GM crops one must look at the benefits as well.  i have family members who would greatly benefit from not having to purchase herbicides and pesticides. this increased profit at harvest time would help inprove their livelihoods greatly.

===message:I agree with Jonah up to the part, where the crops can affect humans I don't believe this is true.  The only time we will have to worry about anything is if the food chain falls.  Plus people will never think science has gone mad they already know it has!
