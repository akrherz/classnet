===message:As you know proteins consist of amino acids. The amino acids have side groups in the "R" portion. See page 69 in your text. Serine, threonine and tyrosine have OH side groups. It is rather easy to find a dye that has a side group  that will react with OH groups  under certain chemical conditions that do not harm the protein. THerefore a dye can be covalently linked to a protein. If the protein binds to something in the cells, the location of the protein can be seen because of the dye. If the protein is an antibody and only binds to one kind of molecule (the antigen) you can see where in the cell that molecule is concentrated. Of course to do this, you must produce the antibody first. Read page 856 of your text for one way to do this and a practical application.
