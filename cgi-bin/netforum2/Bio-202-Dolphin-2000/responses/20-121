===message:I don't think the whole fuss about these GM crops just applies to America. The technology would most likely be applied to other countries that cannot grow their own crops, or are having problems with feeding their poulation. For us, the technology would probably just be used to make our crops stronger and more efficient by cutting down their need for fertilizer and such things.

===message:Right on Chuck. The use of GMO's would be felt world wide. The article refered to multiple global uses (the Rockefeller Foundation investing 100 million in genetic research benefiting the rest of the world) this isn't just something for the United States.

===message:GM crops are not only used in the US. Indeed, they are most likely to have profound effects upon poor/develpoing nations.  These nations, unlike the US,  do not have nearly enough food, and would laugh at the concept of paying people to NOT grow crops. Also, they can make GM crops that are more nutritious (ie, more vitamins), which has the potential to Vastly improve general health in nations that reply on one or two crops and thus are often deficient in vitamins that those plants do not contain.  As for the US, while improving yeild may not be a terribly huge concern, the environment is. And some GT crops have the potential to reduce pesticide and/or herbicide usage, which can have huge environmental benefits.
