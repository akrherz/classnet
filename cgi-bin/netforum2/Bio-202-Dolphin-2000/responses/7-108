===message:As unrealistic as it may seem, long night plants will not flower if the night is interupted by a single falsh of light. This has been tested in cockleburs, strawberries, primroses and poinsettias. In the Bessey greenhouse where they raise pointsettias for Christmas, opening the door at night into a light/dark controlled room will cause "crop failure." Your observation about lightning is an interesting one and is a logical extension of the lab work that has been done. Failure to flower does not necessarily mean extinction for annuals. Many seeds of annuals do not germinate in the first season but in the second or third (seed carryover). Also a flash of light simply resets the clock. If nights continue to be long in a natural setting, the plants will flower. For poinsettias in commercial greenhouses, having them flower in late January does not carry the same financial reward as having them flower a few weeks before Christmas.  Perennials ar enot in danger of extinction because they will come up the following year.
