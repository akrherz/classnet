===message:I totally agree Cheryl.  These questions are going to have to be answered before a lot of people will accept GM crops. I also agree that sometimes scientists have used new techniques before really knowing the long term effects.  I think scientists should really take a lot of time to deal with this topic, so they can take a step back and see all of the possibilities that come with GM crops, both good and bad.
