===message:Different species of wood have different properties. All woods that are used are composed of secondary xylem but it can differ in cell size, number or radial rays, sizes of cells, amount of lignin, as well as many other basic anatomical differences. This makes some woods resistant to splitting, others very flexible, some light and some heavy, etc. There is an interesting book for woodworkers called "Understanding Wood" by Bruce Hoadley if you would like to pursue the subject in more detail.
