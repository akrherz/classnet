===message:As the frequency of muscle stimulation increases, a point is reached when the next imcoming impulse affects the muscle before it can relax from the previous contraction. Summation of contractions begins to occur. See Figure 49.31 in your text. The muscle keeps getting shorter and shorter until it reaches a limit. Therefore more force is developed by the muscle than in a single twitch.  This condition is called tetany and comes from the same root word as tetanus, a bacterial poison that causes your muscles to contract in the same way as highly frequent stimuli.
