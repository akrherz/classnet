===message:Experiments show the ganglia are coordination centers; processing of information occurs there. You could think of them like a new design for a brain that scatters different parts of the brain throughout the body. Presumably the cells that are bunched togethter in a fused ganglion exchange impulses with one another. Having them fused together reduces conduction time (distance) from one location to another and allows for faster responses.
