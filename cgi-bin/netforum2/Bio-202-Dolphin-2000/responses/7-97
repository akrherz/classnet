===message:When we say plants need nitrogen, it is not as nitrogen gas. The nitrogen must be in a usable form as NO3, NO2, and NH3, or something such as urea that soil bacteria will convert to one of these compounds. Animal manures contain urea and ammonia, and other compounds that soil bacteria convert to a usable form of nitrogen. Plants have the enzymes (metabolism) to make all of the organic chemical compounds found in their cells (autotrophs). To make amino acids, bases such as those in nucleic acids, and other nitrogen containing compounds, they use the NO3, NO2, or NH3. A really simple way to think of it is that an amino group in an amino acid comes from sticking a  NH3 on an acid at a particular position in the molecule. To do this, of course, requires that the plant have the enzyme that catalyses the reaction. WHIle this not exactly true, it is close enough. Sometimes the synthesis of amino acids is much more involved and requires several enzymes.
