===message:Muscles will make or lose contractile proteins according to level of use. Therefore a muscle gets bigger (stronger) from exercise by adding contractile units within existing cells. A person who does not use muscles will experience contractile protein loss from cells. Persons with spinal injuries causing leg paralysis often see their leg muscles wither. Artificial movement of the legs may keep some of the muscle mass. There may be some division of muscle cells in healing from wounds, but  this is limited.
