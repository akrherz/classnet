===message:I agree with you.  The public has critized something many of them know nothing about.  This could benefit them in many ways yet they refuse to hear the benefits.  If people would be given facts of both sides their thoughts may be different. The public needs to be educated not only on the bad points of gm crops but also the benefical points of gm crops.

===message:I somewhat agree with you that the good things do outweigh the bad, but I really think that much more long term research needs to be done before we can really make a strong descision about this.  For all we know we could be reeking havoc with the ecosystems of the world.  even our own.
