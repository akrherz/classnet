===message:I know from seeing some reports on GM crops on tv, that some countries in Europe do have labeling on the products made from GM crops. Over there they are supposed to tell the consumer whether or not the product is made from GM crops. A lot of countries in the EU don't agree with GM crops and are  banning the products made from them and won't allow them in their countries.  Some countries are not letting imports of GM crops from the U.S. because they are against GM crops.

===message:I am in complete agreement with what was said.  We, as consumers, have a right to know what we are putting into our bodies, even if there aren't any health risks.  But if there are any potential health risks, we should be informed.

===message:Yeah, i agree that products should have labeled whether or not they were made from GM crops.  Many companies don't have the GM crops labels on their products simply because they are afraid that if they label their products, comsumers are not going to buy them.  But, we consumers sure have the right to know what the products are made from and what we are eating.   If their products are sure safe, they don't have to hide anything or afraid consumers won't buy them.
