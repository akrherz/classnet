===message:As far as I know it makes no difference whether you use a male or female as a nuclear donor for cloning animals. Cells from dividing tissues seem to work better as sources of nuclei than others. Perhaps these are not at as high a state of differentiation than others. The starting over question is the big one that is being researched now. Read the cocnpet of the cell cycle in your text. The G subzero phase is the key. I don't think the fragmented DNA has an efect. You can microsurgically pop the original nucleus out of the egg and get the same results.
