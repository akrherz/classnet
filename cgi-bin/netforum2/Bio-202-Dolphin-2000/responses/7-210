===message:Sharp blows to the kidneys can tear tissues in the kidney. Remember the large amount of vascularization in the kidneys and the high blood pressures expected there. If RBC get into the filtrate because the filters (glomerulus and Bowman's capsule)  are torn, there is no mechanism for reabsorption of the RBC and they will pass out with the urine.
