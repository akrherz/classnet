===message:I wondered when someone would ask this question after I planted that little factoid. The yellow is from the breakdown of hemoglobin which yields a product called urobilinogen. Levels of this will be elevated in liver disease, bile duct blockage, or RBC breakdown. It may also be concentrated during times of dehydration.
