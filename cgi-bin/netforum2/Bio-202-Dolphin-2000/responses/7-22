===message:When peptide bonds form to make a polypeptide, the backbone is not a stratight line so there is not necessarily a top and bottom. Sometimes a spiral is formed and sometimes a straight line, and sometimes a zig-zag pleated sheet. Therefore, the R groups can project at a variety of angles from the long axis of th polypeptide. Remember the secondary structure level? HOw the cell might do this should be subject of some of the lectures next week.
