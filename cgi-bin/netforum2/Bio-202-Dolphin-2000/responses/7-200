===message:I said that muscle movement is what moves blood in the veins. This mechanism works because there are directional flap valves in the larger veins. See the right-hand side of Figure 42.8 in your text. It is both muscle and these valves that work together to speed blood return.  WHen you are sleeping, you are usually prone and there is little pressure difference between your feet and your heart. Even while sleeping you may twitch muscles and breathing movements would aid return of blood the heart. The mechanism is most effective in overcoming the pressure differences that develop when you are standing. DO a little experiment. Measure the height in feet from your heart to the floor while standing. Get a pipe or hose and cut it to that length. HOld in vertical and fill it with water, keeping your finger over the lower end. Note the pressure building as the column of water gets longer. This is the pressure that must be overcome to get blood from your toes to your heart while standing. Repeat with the pipe/hose on its side with a few inch rise from one end to the other. Note the pressure difference from the previous experiment.
