===message:You are correct in stating my belief based on the metabolism test. When I say viruses are "moving around" this is not to imply they have powers of locomotion. They move by being transmitted by fluids passing from individual to another as in a sneeze or by an insect bite or by being excreted and then the liquid evaporates so that the virus becomes airbourne like dust (they are smaller than the smallest cells). They may also become airbourne when an infected cell lyses, the contents dry, and the viruses are swept away by air curents. Similar scenarios can be created for cells dying in water and the virus particles being water-bourne to a new cell as when contaminated water is ingested. They invade because they have receptors on their capsule surfaces that bind to the host cell. This somehow activates nucleic acid injection into the new host cell. As for the lifecycle question, I have followed convention in using the term. You might consider it an analogy to what happens in living organisms. When you read about viruses, you should realize that different authors may have the living or non-living perspective. Don't get hung up on which is right and wrong. Accept the dualism and then try to understand the underlying biology that can be learned from these fascinating "organisms" or for consistency should I say mobile genetic systems?
