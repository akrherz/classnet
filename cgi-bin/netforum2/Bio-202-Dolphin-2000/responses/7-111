===message:Ethylene causes biochemical chages to occur in cells of a fruit, probably by activating certain genes and turning others off. Chlorophyll will break down revealing orange and red pigments during ripening, much like what happens in leaves in autumn. Cell walls are broken down and soften. Consequently fruits are soft when ripe. Abscission is promoted and the the fruits fall off the plants. If you neeed further details, you might want to look up ethylene in Biological Abstracts as you did root hairs. (Catch that sap in a bucket and gently boil it to concentrate it: you may get enough maple syrup for a pancake breakfast.)
