Cramping of muscles occurs when muscles contract spasmodically and do not relax completely in between contractions. THis condition may be due to the lack of ATP which is needed to move Ca ions back into the endoplasmic reticulum after a contraction occurs. When Ca++ is removed from the cytosol, actin and myosin will break the linkages that they  develop during a contraction.
