===message:I agree with what this person said.  Before these products are put on the market more research needs to be done to ensure the consumers that no harm will come of animals as well as humans.  Research also needs to be conducted to make sure that antibiotics will still work on the bacteria found in humans so that no epidemics will occur.  I also agree that the GMO's seem to be a good idea, but I think we need to be leary about putting these products out on the market before more research is done.

===message:I agree with what you have to say about GMO's.  The consumer needs to be warned, but not scared.  I think that there are risks when you purchase any new products, but GMO's are beneficial in so many ways that the risks are minor compared to the benefits.  I know that their needs to be more testing, but I hope that the public isn't too scared off by the labels and the hype going on about GMO's so that by the time they are testing 100% safe and successful that it'll be too late.
