===message:I fail to see the large downsides to other technological advances that you refer to. I don't think you understand what life would be like without technological advances.  This is an another advance we need to make the world a better place.

===message:If there hadn't been technological advances in the past, you probably would have died as a small child from some disease because you wouldn't have had a vaccine for it. The risks of the past have made us the great animals we are today.

===message:I can understand the concern behind GM crops altering the environment, but I cannot understand why we should just brush aside such an advancement which could better our lives. As far as knowing more technologically, I think that the only way to find out more about what is possible and what is not is simply by trial and error, and seeing what works without consequence and what does not.
