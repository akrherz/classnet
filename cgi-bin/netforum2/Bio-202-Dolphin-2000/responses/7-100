===message:Magnesium, as Mg++,  is part of the functioning chlorophyll molecule. Without it chlorophyll will not absorb light and transfer the energy to an electron. Plants placed in a magnesium deficient environment, suffer chlorosis: they are yellow and not green because the chlorophyll does not absorb red and blue light, reflecting green. They tend to be weak and do not grow well. Add magnesium and they were turn green and resume normal growth. ALthough we have not emphasized it, metal ions are often parts of molecules and are necessary for their function. Iron is part of hemoglobin and an iron deficiency will lead to reduced oxygen transport in the blood. Cobalt ions, zinc ions, and copper ions are necessary for the functioning of many other molecules in biological systems.
