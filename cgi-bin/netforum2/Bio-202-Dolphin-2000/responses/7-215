===message:NOt being a surgeon, I have to reason an answer. First they probably take a region of vein that has not flaps. If there were flap valves as long as they installed them so that blood flow was in a direction so that the flaps did not open, there would be no problem. Your grandfather may have some minor circulation problems in his leg as a result of the operation, but what was the alternative? Also when they took this vein section which would not be very long, were they able to stretch the leg veins to close the gap or to do some rerouting of veins to compensate? It is my understanding that when a vein is put in place like this that the wall of the vessel thickens over time and the vein becomes very artey-loke.
