===message:I do not know the answer to your questions. It could be that people that experience this have a problem secreting insulin from the pancreas and not a problem synthesizing it (mutation). Some factor could trigger its release. Also, although we talk about hormones as if they worked alone, they often work in tandem or triplets. There are a number of hormones that influence blood sugar levels. They include glucagon, adrenalin (epinephrine), and glucocorticosteroids. THe change in blood sugar level  may not be due to an insulin "dump," but a change in the rate at which one or more of these hormones are produced. Dr. Eugenia Farrar in Zoology is an endocrinologist and may be able to answer your questions. She was not in today as I answered your questions, otherwise I would have consulted with her.
