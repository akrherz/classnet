===message:It is true that there needs to be more research done, this field is still a bit new.  There is ongoing research in regards to weeds getting a gene that will fight against the GM crops.  The best research is monitoring the weeds and the crops out in the fields and it can also benefit the food output for the meantime.

===message:I agree that the factor of new varieties of weeds as a result of GM crops is important to be aware of.  They can affect ecosystems just as the stability of the monarch butterfly can affect other ecosystems.  More research should be done to be able to suppress any consequence of the new technology.
