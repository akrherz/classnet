===message:I was thinking the same thing when I was lecturing on the topic. While ethylene treatment may cause color development, does it cause the softening of tissues in the same way as field ripening? I do not know. Many tomatoes that are planted in commercial fields for the supermarket are also special varieties that have been bred for a number of characters: size, color, quick growth, shelf life, and  ability to withstand shipping. Perhaps the difference you note is due to different genetics as well as ethylene induction of ripening.
