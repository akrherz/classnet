===message:I am not sure that I can answer this. Certainly lactic acid plays a part. When a person gets in shape it involves changes in the metabolism of muscle cells, addition of muscle mass within cells, and changes in the vasculature supplying the muscle. The first and last in this list will influence how much lactic acid accumulates in a muscle. This not only can effect the muscle cells but nerves in the area as well.
