===message:I think that by saying that GM crops should be banned is a bit too extreme.  At least at this stage of development.  I agree that the consumer has a right to know if the food that they are eating is a genetically modified product or not, there are also many benefits of GM crops.  Such as the GM cotton, which increased farmers yields by 85 million pounds.  That's a lot of cotton.  It made 92 million dollars more than farmers that did not use the GM cotton.  It also allowed farmers to use less pesticide use, which benefits the environment.  Not all GM products will be this beneficial but to just say ban all GM products would be wasting some great tecnology.  There should be strict regulations and studies on the GM crops before they are allowed to be used, so that any GM crop with potential harmful side effects be banned.

===message:Yes, the effects of GM crops are not yet known, but completely banning them seems a little extreme. Not only would this lower production and increase costs, but you would be destroying all the farmers and companies who had invested their future in these crops.

===message:I completely agree that the implication of GM crops in consumer market while developers are still unsure of their complete affects is absolutely irresponsible and unacceptable.  The power that is contained in the GM sciences has the potential to inflict a great deal of harm on our environment and ourselves if we are not careful.  However, at the same time, i must say that a complete ban of GM products is not the right anwser.  GM science is very similar to nuclear technology in that it has the potential for great advantages when it is used with care.  Such a fledgling science as Genetic modification should not be handled so clumsily as it many profit-driven coroporations do.  But, this is a call for more regulation and better testing, not absolute abolition.
