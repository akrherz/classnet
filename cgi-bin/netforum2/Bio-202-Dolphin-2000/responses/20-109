===message:i agree, a zero risk policy might be the only way to go until we can effectively analyze the new crops to decide if they could cause health problems to plants or animals. new GM crops could be slowly killing people right now, and we wouldn't know it, so it really depends on how much you trust the current checks they use right now

===message:Good point about the WOW chips.  I think that many highly-processed/engineered food products could be more harmful than GM crops.  I think those products need to be highly tested and regulated as well.
