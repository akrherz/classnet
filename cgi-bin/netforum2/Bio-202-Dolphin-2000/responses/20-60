===message:Although labeling initially seems like a good way to deal with GMOs until further testing has been done, I can't help but think that it is being given too much credit.  In the first place, I dont think that the general public has been introduced to enough information regarding GM crops to make an informed decision.  Maybe I am naive, (though certainly less so after reading these articles) but I often assume that if the FDA is allowing foods to be sold, it must be safe.  I think that most people would assume this as well and while a select few may take a GM label into consideration, most consumers would probably ignore it.  Unless the government is planning on educating the general public as to specifically what the GM label means and the potential risks involved with it, labeling is (at least in my opinion) essentially ineffective.  Also, I would like to respond to your comment that "a few butterflies dying" would be no big deal.  If I've learned one thing in biology, it is that all organisms are unbelieveably interconnected, leading me to believe that "a few butterflies dying" could potentially become a more massive problem.

They should be informed about the product that they are buying.
