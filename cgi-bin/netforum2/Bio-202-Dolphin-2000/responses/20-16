===message:There is no telling how long it will take scientists to modify a crop that will not harm the environment. Until then, farmers will continue to use the genetically modified seeds and potentially damaging the ecosystem. By creating genetically modified crops, the scientists are in a way playing the role of God. They are dictating what should survive and what shouldn't. What happens when all the Monarch Butterflies die and the organisms that feed on the butterfiles start disappearing? This creates a domino affect that will not be able to stop. How many animals will have die before people will recognize that GM Crops might not be so safe? Hopefully not many.
