===message:AN interesting question and one to which I will make a few speculative answers. First read page 763 in the text for some information. I would add to that by saying that vines can grow up other plants and gain advantage by responding to touch: they climb. Also plants that are crowded next to other plants can grow away from them and thus gain the advantage of not competing directly for sunlight. Remember that responses can be + or -.
