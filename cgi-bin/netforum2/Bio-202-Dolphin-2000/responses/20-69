===message:I do not agree with you.  I do not want to sacrifice butterlies and nature either but these tests haven't been proven to affect butterlies and weeds all of the time.  There is a possiblity something else could have killed the butterflies.  Yes, corn prices are already low but these crops don't have to be used in the united states.  There are plenty of families starving in areas were crops can't grow. With gm crops we can possibly created a crop to grow in harsh conditions giving these people the food they need and their own independence.  I believe the gm crops have more good points than bad ones.
