===message:I suppose that it theoretically could benefit aquatic plants exposed to high light and therefore having high internal oxygen levels. However, the stomatata could stay open in such plants all of the time becuse of high water availability, allowing oxygen to leave so that it should not build to excessive levels. I do not know if there are aquatic C4 plants.
