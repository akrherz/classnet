===message:Priamry growth results from the activity of apical meristems that cause an increase in length of roots and shoots. Secondary growth results from the activity of cambiums--dividing cells in the stem and root--that cause an increase in girth. In a growing dicot plant both types of growth occur at the same time as the plant gets larger. Monocots lack secondary growth.
