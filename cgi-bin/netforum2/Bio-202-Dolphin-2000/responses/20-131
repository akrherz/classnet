===message:While I can see your point about the corporations becoming rich off of this thing, I must strongly disagree about the benefit of them that will be felt all around the world.  The population keeps on growing larger and larger, and we currently don't have enough food to feed very many of them at all.  That's why we need genetically engineered crop species, because they're the only thing that we have out there that could even possibly give us a chance to increase crop yields, and to truly feed the world.  Anything that helps all of humanity to live a better life can't possibly be bad for the world.
