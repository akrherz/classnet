===message:Clotting is not the same as plugging. Clotting is a rather complex process starting with several soluble proteins in the blood that become fibrous and insoluble during clotting. As I understand P protein, it is there as a kind of gooey plug. When fluid flow in the phloem is rapid it is swept along with the flow until it hits the sieve plate where it plugs the holes in the plate preventing further loss of fluid.
