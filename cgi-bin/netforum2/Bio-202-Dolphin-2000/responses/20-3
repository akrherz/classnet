===message:But when these products come to market, and are labeled as being GM products, the only thing consumers know is the harmful affects.  The media is sure to relate the harmful outcomes of using this product but does not expand on the positive side.  As in the example of BST milk.  Consumers would not buy this milk because it was a GM product.  Even though there was no coverage on the positive side.  All the public knew was that it was a genetically engineered steroid to producte more milk.  They didn't know that there are no harmful side effects and that it allows a small farmer to earn a better income.

===message:I completely agree. Without more testing and research, it makes it difficult for us as consumers to trust our lives and environment on the GM products. I also agree that there may already be and potentially be a number of benefits to GM crops, but I don't think that it is something that needs to be rushed. In order for the American public to trust GM products, we need to be informed, and we must be able to trust that our producers are telling us the truth and that they are not just trying to shove their products off on us by not labeling them.

===message:There is no reason to inhibit research that is very beneficial to humans just because it might have a negative effect on butterflies.  There is a reason that there are so many insects on the face of the earth.  They know how to adapt to survive.  This case is no different.  Natural selection will select the butterflies that are immune to this and life will go on for the butterflies as always.  Human life will be better too.

===message:I agree, however, I don't think that we need to ensure safety to every creature that comes into contact with a GMO.  That is the whole point of Bt corn, to destroy pests.  But, I agree that before we make wide use of these plants, the long-term effects should be considered.  I also strongly agree that the public should be informed not only about which products have been genetically engineered, but also about the entire issue so that they can make informed decisions about these products.
