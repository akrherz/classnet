===message:I spoke with Dr. Charles Drewes, our resident invertebrate neurobiologist about your question. Not a lot of research has occurred on Cnidarian nervous systems. They are non-directional as I stated. The synapses are different in that they work in both directions, not just one direction as I discussed for vertebrates in class. The nerves conduct like vertebrate nerves, but implulses can initiate at either end not just one end as in vertebrates. A nerve impulse entering the net, spreads diffusely through out the body, although there may be some tracks to certain muscles. JUst how movement is coordinated is an interesting but not not well understood question. Behavior is slow because the muscles are slow acting compared to vertebrates. THey have what are called musculoepithelial cells, a combination surface layer and muscle cell.
