===message:Decreasing sensitivity comes from constant stimulation of a receptor. WHat you call increasing senstivity is probably training. As a visual person, when you now look at Chinese characters do you recognize all of the differences for the thousands of characters? Probably not, but you could LEARN to do so by learning what to look for and where differences typically occur. Likewise if your sight were removed so that you had no other choice, you could LEARN to recognize the different patterns of Braille because you would know what to feel for, how to hold your hands, and how to interpret the "feel pattern" for which you now have no training.
