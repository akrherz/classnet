===message:I am hesitant to be too definite on this topic. The Amer. Med. Ass'n has gone back and forth on the value of aspirin and wine (not the combo!). You could use the WWW to see what they now are saying. Aspirin does thin the blood, no question. Whether this results in short or long term inprovement in life for an average person, is the subject of the debate. My personal philosophy is avoid fads and things that are not natural. If you are going to ingest something on a long term basis, ask yourself if research has been done that lasted as long as the time you plan to take it (months, years, decades?). Were side efects seen over that time? As a biologist, I believe that if thinner blood were an advantage to humans, natural selection would have provided us with thinner blood. Since we do not have thin blood, there must be some advantage to thicker blood. Having said this, I do not argue that thinning the blood may is bad all of the time. I can visualize certain pathologies where thinner blood may allow a person to recover from a sickness/injury or live a normal life. However, this is based on an abnormality of th eblood being too thick to start.
