===message:If I am thinking correctly, the trend is for more recently evolved organisms to greater requirements for amino acids, that is more are essential and must be part of the diet. Bacteria, plants, fungi and may protists can make all 20 amino acids. Mammals require 7 and can make 13. AS far as I know, all critters usse the same amino acids in making proteins, although some organisms have some strange amino acids included ntheir proteins, but I do not think this fits any kind of a molecular evolution pattern.
