===message:Your perceptive question is a good one. Membrane that is added to the surface by exocytosis is removed by endocytosis of small vesicles, possiblt pinocytosis-type vesicles. These vesicles pass from the cell surface to the Golgi Apparatus where they are recycled and used in packagaing new secretory material that passes to the cell surface and is forms new exocytosis vesicles. If this did not occur, the cell would get larger as you observe.
