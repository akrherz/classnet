I assume that there is a theoretical limit to the pH differences than can develop across the cell membrane. Remember that the pH difference arises as a result of electron transport. Let's look first just at the building of the gradient. The first hydrogen ions would be easy to tranport because there is no gradient. As the gradient builds, the energy difference across the membrane builds. I would think at some point electron transport would not have enough energy to add any more hydrogen ions: that would be the theoretical limit. Of course in natural situations, an equilibrium is established between the transport of hydrogen ions out and their leakage back in through the ATP synthase enzyme imbedded in the membrane. Therefore, most mitochondria/chloroplast probably operate at some equilibrium pH value and do approach a theoretical limit.
