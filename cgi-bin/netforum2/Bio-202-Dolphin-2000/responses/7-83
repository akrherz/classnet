===message:In trying to make the assignment simple, I did bend a few principles, but it was a workable problem. First we were dealing with a very short DNA fragment and because a stop codon was included, we know that it was from the end of a gene, not the start. I asked for the polypeptide sequence that was coded for by the fragment. Because it was short, we knew that we were looking at the end of the protein and not the whole thing. If we had the whole gene, I would expect about 150 nucleotides or more because most proteins are 50 amino acids or more. You are correct in observing that it would have had a start codon at the begining of TAC in the DNA to yield the mRNA with a first codon of AUG. WHat were also missing were some other segmetns of DNA that I have been lumping under the term control elements.
