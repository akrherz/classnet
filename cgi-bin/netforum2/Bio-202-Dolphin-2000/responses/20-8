===message:I agree, Gm crops have their positive side as well as their negitive side but what we really should be looking at is; is is needed.  Don't we already have enought food?  Using GM crops could cause a surplus which would have a very negative affect on food prices thus hurting the farmers who grow it.

===message:	Just because something isn't needed now doesn't mean it won't be needed in the future.  GM crops have the potential to be a wonderful addition to the growing list of "new and improved" items.  With the world population growing at an alarming rate, crops which produce higher yields seem practically necessary!!  Still, I believe more testing needs to be done to insure that these crops are not harmful in any way.  At any rate, the fact that economic conditions are not peak should not hinder the continued use and experimentation with GM crops.  If we wait untill GM crops are completely necessary before implementing them it might be too late.  We need to think ahead and perfect these organisms now.
