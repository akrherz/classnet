===message:I will soon talk about viruses. One whole group of viruses, of which HIV is a member, has RNA as its hereditary material instead of DNA as in cells and other viruses. When these viruses invade a cell, the reverse transcriptase of the virus, makes a DNA copy of the RNA from the virus. The DNA copy can then be copied again and again by using the cell's enzymes and sources of nucleotides.
