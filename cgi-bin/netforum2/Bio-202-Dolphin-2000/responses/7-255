===message:Rods tend to work cooperatively to provide sharp vision. Having more receptors for the dim light of night increases the chances of seeing something in the dark. Bright light on the other hand does not require as many receptors to trigger action potentials in the optic nerve. For similar reasons, cones do not work cooperatively.
