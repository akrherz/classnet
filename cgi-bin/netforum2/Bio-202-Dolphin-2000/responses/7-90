===message:In nerve cells, the nerve impulse is a momentary change in the charge that occurs across the nerve cell membrane. The charge is not due to H+ differences, however. Nerve cells pump Na+ out of and K+ ions in to the cell. The differences in the mobilities of these ions sets up a charge difference across the cell membrane with the inside being negative relative to the outside. This is called the resting potential. When a nerve inmpulse moves along a nerve cell, Na+ are allowed to leak in and K+ out causing a decrease in the voltage across the membrane. The mechanism is somewhat similar to proton pumps, but it it is really a very different mechansism. We will cover it in detail later i the course.
