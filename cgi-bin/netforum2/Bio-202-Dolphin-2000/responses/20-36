===message:So how do we know when something is safe or not, what you think is safe, I might think is unsafe.  We test other drug for usage but for some people it is safe and others it is not.

===message:I am not sure why we need to genetically alter foods to make them more nutritious.  Currently, food production technologists do a darn good job of making food more nutritious using good ol' breeding techniques to make various varieties.  For example, the soybeans used for tofu are varieties that have more protein than soybenas used for feed.  It is possible for humans to create much healthier foods without depending upon gene modification, so why should we consider it?  Also, if something contains an introduced gene that does not belong in the plant naturally, it may lower the nutrition value of the plant.
