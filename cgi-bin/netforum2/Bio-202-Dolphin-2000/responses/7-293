===message:THe medulla is where the vomiting reflex is coordinated. Sensory nerve inputs into the center will trigger motor impulses going to the muscles of the throat, esophagus, stomach, and abdominal muscles. WHen you stick your finger down your throat, you stimulate sensory receptors that set the vomiting reflex in motion. I do not think that the virus is affecting the medulla although I could be wrong. I think it is causing irritation in the stomach that stimulates receptors which send a sensory input to the vomiting center.
