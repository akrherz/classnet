===message:BActeria can be harvested and killed to release their contents. The insulin can be extracted from the resulting protein soup. It is also possible to add some control elements to the insulin gene that will designate it as a protein to be secreted. In that case, the insulin is taken from the culture medium. Fortunately, there are laws about grinding up human males for milk, although they most likely have the gene to begin with but it is not expressed!
