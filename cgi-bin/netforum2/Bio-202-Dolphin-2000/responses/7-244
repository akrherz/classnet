===message:Yes this type of thing happens. In fact my mother-in-law who lost a leg, use to get what felt like an intense cramp in her amputated foot. The interpretation is rather straight forward. The nerves that use to go to the limb are still in the upper leg. Prior to the amputation, and information coming from that nerve was related to the foot. When the foot is removed and  for some reason the nerve spontaneously conduct spurious action potentials, the CNS interprets the information as coming from the foot that is not there. THis is called "phantom pain." I cannot imagine what goes throughan amputee's mind when this happen: pain from a limb that is missing?
