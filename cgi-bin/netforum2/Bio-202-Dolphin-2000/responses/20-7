===message:Okay, so we go for the whole GM crop deal and make all this food, enough to feed everyone, all 6 billion plus.  A noble cause, the world will be fed on franken foods.  Right now the USA has all this surplus grain and is paying farmers not to grow crops, but they cannot get the food to the people.  Or maybe it is they won't get the food to the people (wouldn't want to hurt the market by giving out freebies).  So who benefits?  Those who already have enough to eat.  You may have made the food, but the problem is not solved.  In short, I feel that GM foods are a good idea for only a few.

===message:Not to be rude, but there is currently no world food shortage.  Starvation in 3rd world countries is the result of an inadequate distribution system rather than any real shortage.  Frankly, food distribution is governed by the laws of economics more than anything else.  Poor countries can't buy U.S. crops so the U.S. doesn't give them food.  It is as simple as that.  GM crops are not going to solve world hunger and may lead to a number of unforseen problems.  (I seriously doubt that many people worried about global warming at the start of the industrial revolution.)  Perhaps it is time we slow down "progress" for the sake of long term security.

===message:     I really don't think we should bring God into the issue of human error.  Man has put so many limitations on nature and caused enough extinctions.  Do we really want to be another problem for another species?  By altering the genes of crops, we in turn alter the habitat of the next species.  I'd love to solve some of those food problems, but we have to wonder if we aren't creating an even bigger one.

===message:I agree that GM crops have benefits, but there is a fine line between what we should do to increase yields and what could potentially destroy our environment.  We don't know the long term consequences and should show caution before we start mass producing GM crops.  Remember the saying "Don't mess with Mother Nature"?

===message:I don't think you realize how much food the US produces every year. We could feed everyone now if we chose to do so. However, I see your point about saving land-space by having more yield per acre. This could be one of the good things about having GM crops, but does saving a little space make up for all the detriments it would cause? Like, do these GM crops harm any other species? Do GM crops have any long-term effects on humans (to say the least)? I don't like the idea of "all for one, and all for me". Just because it seems that GM crops benefit humans, doesn't necessarily mean that it benefits other species. We are not the only organisms on this planet that matter.
