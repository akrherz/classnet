===message:THey are different in function and often chemical composition. As you said hormones are messengers. Target cells will have receptors that bind with the hormone if it is present. The hormone-receptor complex may activate and enzyme or it may activate genes in a cell leading to the synthesis of enzymes. The hormone is not a catalyst and does not bind with a substrate which it chemically changes. Mammalian hormones may be steroids, amino acid derivatives , or proteins. Plant hormones are not proteins but small molecules. Enzymes are for the most part proteins. They bind with a substrate and promote a chemical change in the substrate. They are catalysts and as such lower the activation energy required in a reaction. If this is not clear, see me after class.
