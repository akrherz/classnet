===message:Tyree- I read your opinion on GE foods and I agree with you about being a little leery on the subject.  Everything is here today and the way it is b/c of evolution within certain species.  However, some biogeneticists are trying to cross different species with one another without knowing the end result. For instance, fish genes are being crossed with plant genes to try to improve our food supply.  Is this the same thing as evolution?  I think you know that answer.  This is stuff that is happening and posing great fear in some, especially vegetarians who don't know when they eat a plant if it contains a gene from an animal or not.  Who knows if this could be a threat to our entire ecosystem, I hope we don't find out the hard way.

===message:My messege is very similar to yours. I would like to see the end to world hunger and it would be great if these "miracle plants" did it. There have been some studies made on the effects that these GMOs will have on the environment. No studies will totally prepare us for what nature may do. Changing a plants genes will change not only that plant but everything that interacts with it. There is no way of predicting the adverse effects of these crops. Maybe sometime in the future they will be found to be safe and effective ways of producing food for humans but what about other effects they may also have? These plants may end up killing off species or creating a stronger more powerful weed or insect. So, as of now, while there is little information known about GMOs I believe they should not be used.
