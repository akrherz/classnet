===message:Yes, they did find a well preserved carcass of a wooly mammoth in Siberia--stuck in permafrost. I do not know the condition of the cells, however. For the genome in various cells to be preserved, it would have to have cooled rapidly which might not have occurred for an animal so large. Nonetheless, assuming they can get a nucleus with all of the DNA intact, they do not have an egg. My guess is that they would use an elephant egg as a closely related species. After inserting the nucleus into the egg cytoplasm, the egg could be put back into a female elephant for development. Hormonal treatment of any female mammal will make her uterus capable of receiving and implanting a fertilized egg. Work has shown that you can cross species lines, putting the fertilized egg of one species in a female of another related species and getting live offspring. Realize if the mammoth work is successful, that the nuclear inheritance will mammoth, but the cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) inheritance will be elephant or whatever they use as a egg cytoplasm donor.
