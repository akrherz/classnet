===message:One effect does not dominate nor is there really cancellation. Instead there is blending. Think of it like heating and cooling water. 100 degrees C is a threshold. When you reach it the water boils. You can add heat (a + neurotransmitter or ice a - transmitter). If you add enough heat, the threshold is reached. Otherwise the temperature simply changes as the balnce of heating and cooling is approached. As Na flows out and K flows in, the membrane potential changes like the temperature in the anaalogy. If the threshold is reached, an action potential is triggered.
