===message:My question to Andrew is how do we know that the upsides completely outweigh the downsides if we don't fully know the downsides yet?  We may not know all of the downsides for another 20-50 years.  Right now it does look like the downsides would be few, but how can we really tell for sure what time is going to bring?  We can't just embrace GM crops because they sound like an easy solution.  There has to be much more research and a good test of time before I can say that I don't have any fears about GM crops.
