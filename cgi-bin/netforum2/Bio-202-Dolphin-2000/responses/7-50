===message:The basis of genetic engineering is to take DNA from one cell and put it in another. How do you get it in the other cell? You must use a vector--something that will "transport" it into the new cell. Plasmids are used to transport genes into bacteria and yeast, and viruses to transport DNA into many different types of cells including plant cells. ALternative is to inject DNA, but this is really tedious and yields few cells with new DNA in them. You can use electric shocks to get it in some cells as well.
