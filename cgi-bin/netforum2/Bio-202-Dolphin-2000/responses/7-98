===message:I am not sure that I understand your question. Root pressure due to osmosis can push water up the xylem, maybe only to about about a meter or two according to your text. THAt is the root pressure theory. The negative pressure associated with this is psi, the water potential. In the TCT theory, there is a negative pressure that draws the water up the xylem column from the roots (or beyond the 2 meters of root pressure) and this can be a 100 meters or so in a tall tree. This negative pressure is genenerated by the radius of curvature of the meniscus on top of the water column in the xylem trace from root to tip of stem. As the curvature increases, the negative prressure increases drawing water upward so that the meniscus flattens. If this doe snot make sense, see me after class adn I can draw some pisctures and you can ask your question in different way if I have misinterpreted.
