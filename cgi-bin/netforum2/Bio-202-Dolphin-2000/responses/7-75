===message:Okasaki fragments are formed as the lagging strand replicates. See figure 16.16 in your text. To start DNA synthesis on the lagging strand, a RNA primer is first made (about nucleotides long). The DNA polymerase then begins to attach DNA nucleotides to the end of this primer and may do so for several 100 nucleotides before it runs into a fragment that was made early. It stops. WHile this was happening, the DNA helix has opened further, exposing a new region of the lagging strand. The proces will repeat on this newly exposed section starting with the manufacture of the RNA primer. A special enzyme comes in a clips out all RNA primers attached to DNA fragments. When they are cut out, they are replaced by DNA nucleotides. You have lots of short stretches of DNA only now bound to the lagging strand. An enzyme, ligase, comes in and joins the fragmetns together to produce a whole DNA molecule bound to the replicating strand. The fragments of DNA, obviosly a temporary arrangement, are called Okazaki fragmetns after the Japanese scientist who dicovered them. Their discovery led to the discovery of the differences between the leading and lagging strand during DNA synthesis. If this is not clear, see me after class.
