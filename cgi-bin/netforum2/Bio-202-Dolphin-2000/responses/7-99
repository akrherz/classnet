===message:Interesting question and one that I am not sure that I can answer. However, yo certainly are thinking like a scientist and taking information you have learned and setting up hypotheses to test the truth of what you have learned. THe leaf modifactions of a pitcher plant are genetic and really are evolutionary adaptations. I would expect that these leaves would always be tubular, regardless of environmental effects. This is not to say that fertilizing pitcher plants would not have an effect on the shape or other physiology of their leaves, but I cannot predict what that woudl be.
