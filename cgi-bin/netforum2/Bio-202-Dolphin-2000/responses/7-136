===message:I never heard this one before and forgot to tell my kids about it. While I do not know how long bubble gum stays in the stomach, I think I can make a few statements about what probably happens to it. First, I do not think the acid attacks it. (You could test this by taking some gum to chem lab and putting it in a beaker of 1N HCl for the length of the lab, but check with your TA first.) There are no enzymes that will attack it. Therefore, it will remain intact. Chyme leaving the stomach will be a liquid suspension: large pieces (relative) will be held back but eventually all of the stomach contents empty into the small intestine. Nothing will digest the gum although it may become stringy at body temperature. Possibly bile will emulsify it somewhat and it may then break into smaller pieces which pass on as non-digestible. Guess what happens to those small pieces. If one was dedicated, they could be recovered but it might take 7 years to work up the courage: hence the basis of the time estimate in the myth.
