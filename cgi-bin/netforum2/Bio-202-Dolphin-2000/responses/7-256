===message:YOu collect the bacteria that have been reproducing the gene and kill them. Using techniques similar to the ones done in 202L you can isolate the DNA from the dead bacteria. You then have to cut it with a restriction endonuclease that regognizes the beginning and end of the gene that you inserted originally in the plasmid. The DNA is then electrophoresed to separte DNA fragements of different lengths. USing some special techniques you can identify which fragments are the gene. You cut that band out of the electrophoresis gel and remove the DNA by washing. The DNA you now have represents multiple copies of the gene. You figure some way to get it into the plant you want to engineer: possibly using a plant virus or an electroporation gun. Other ways are possible. Read pages 383 and 384 of your text.
