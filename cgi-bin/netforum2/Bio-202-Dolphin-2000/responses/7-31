===message:Mutations are random whenever DNA replicates. The effects of mutations are random; some +, some -, some neutral. THe bad ones usually will kill the bacterium having them, and the mutation is removed from the gene pool. The + ones convey an advantage and the neutral ones will be carried along without affecting the host. These remain in the gene pool and the gene containing them could mutate again or not at all: its random. If the effect of the second is -, bacterium dies. If it is neutral or +_, it lives. Over time, a gene could change substantially.
