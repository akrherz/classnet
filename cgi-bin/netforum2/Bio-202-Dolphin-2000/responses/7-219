===message:The circular circuit I talked about is theoretical. If they exist, there are probably more than the three neurons that I discussed. Such timing circuits could be important in setting up timing circuits for things like breathing rate or minmal heart rate. Such circuits have been demonstrated in snails, a much studied animal with a simple nervous system. To my knowledge, they have not been demonstrated in humans.
