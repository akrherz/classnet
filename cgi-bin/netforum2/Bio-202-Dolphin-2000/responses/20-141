===message:I do see what you mean by "accidentally creating a super weed," but I do not think your concern is well-founded.  I believe that if you are going to create a super weed, it would have to be on purpose.  "Accidentally" creating something like that seems highly unlikely.  Also, GM crops can actually reduce the amount of pesticides/herbicides being used by making it possible for the GM plant to have special properties that would do away with the pests without the use of chemicals.
