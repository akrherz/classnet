===message:I don't think that GM Crops are such a bad idea, even though  there is a huge controversy about them right now.  My opinion is that more serious, or should I put it careful researches should take place before we perminently make GM crops a part of life.  As far as the butterfly issue goes, I think that an experiment should have been done on the larvae  right the first time.  I read in a Soybean Digest magazine that the professor at Cornell University that conducted that experiment overdosed on pollen and the amount he "fed" the larvae was equivilent to a human eating 100 lbs of salt in one day. If research is going to be such a main priority, then maybe it should be done in a more careful manor.  As far as do I think GM Crops have a future?, I think that sooner or later the European Industry will adapt to the U.S. technology in GMO's, and as far as marketability goes, only future research on such issues will determine the fate.
