===message:I agree with you Kristen, if there isn't scientific evidence to back it up, there is no reason to believe it.  I have heard of some problems with Super Cows though, I heard that the hormones used to make them produce more, are harmful to people who intake the cow products.

===message:I agree with you about labels.  The public definately has a right to know whether the products they are consuming are genetically modified.  While it appears that most GM products are safe for human use, the public should be given the choice of using them or not.  Also, if companies agree to this, it shows confidence in their GM products.  Otherwise, it appears that they have something to hide.

===message:	In your message you state,"if science really can't back up that there is a problem affecting society, there shouldn't be a big worry."  I disagree with this opinion.  I believe that until science can prove there is definately no harm to humans, ecosystems, populations, environments, etc. we should worry because through worry comes research and answers.  Simply because we haven't seen any immediate problems doesn't mean there aren't any.  Only through extensive research can we prove if something is completely safe, and only then should it be approved for use.

===message:Kristin has a good point.  So much research has been done on so many organisms.  No one knows for sure how many new genetic inventions will hurt different species.  It is a concern though to consider if humans eat say the crops that are gentically modified, if our growth will be stunt or other maybe harmful consequences.  So much research needs to be done.

===message:I agree more research needs to be done.  With experts arguing its hard to make a decision either way.  You're right to that GM products should be labeled so at least we can make that decision.

===message:I agree with Kristen, even though everyone thinks Gm products are bad there is nothing to prove they are.  Even many of the scientists int the article we read stated that gm products will have a minimal effect on people and the environment.  So the only thing holding gm products back is a fear that has no proof.
