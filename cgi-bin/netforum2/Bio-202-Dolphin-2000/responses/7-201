===message:Ot having seen the show, I have to guess at explaining what you saw. I suspect the baby was not placed in water. Rather it was placed in a cocktail of water containing salts, possibly surfactants, and other things. THe water was also probably supersaturated with oxygen. I would also guess that the water was moved in and out of the lungs by a pump. When we breathe water, the water has a low oxygen content and is very heavy. It requires a great deal of energy to move it in and out of the lungs. We probably do not get enough oxygen to make the energy we need to move the water. In addition surfactant is washed out and if we were to return to air breathing, we would have a hard time. You would think that if the mammalian system were adaptable to water breathing that marine mammals such as seals, dolphins, and whales would have adopted it over the course of evolutionary history.
