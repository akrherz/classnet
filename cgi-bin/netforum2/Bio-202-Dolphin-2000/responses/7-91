===message:As I understand it, normal practices of taking sap do decrease the nutrients available for leaf out, but not  to th epoint of really injuring a tree. As a result the tree grows a little slower, but survives. Think of it like donating blood. It obvious has an effect but that can be overcome. In the same way it is possible to put too many taps in a tree, and I think under those circumstances you can really stunt its growth or perhaps kill it: likewise in the taking of blood.
