===message:Tropomyosin covers the myosin binding sites in the actin molecules when a muscle is at rest (relaxed). If the muscle is stimulated, Ca++ floods out of endoplasmic reticulum and binds to troponin (see figure 42.29 in text). When troponin binds Ca++ it pushes the tropomyosin aside so the mysoin binding sites are accessible. Myosin crossbridges then bind to the sites and shift actin over the surface of the mysoin (contraction). Relaxation occurs within 10 msec of a single stimulation by the endoplasmic reticulum transporting all of teh Ca++ back into its cisternae. The process can repeat again or can even occur before all of the Ca is recovered. In that case tetany starts to develop.
