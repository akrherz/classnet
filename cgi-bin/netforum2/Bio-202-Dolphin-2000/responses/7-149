===message:Your assumptin would be correct if the hemoglobin was fully loaded with oxygen. Most people that are given oxygen receive it because their hemoglobin is not fully saturating with oxygen in the lungs. In order to saturate the hemoglobin, you raise the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs. Now you have a diffusion gradient that is steeper and hemoglobin loads. NOrmal unloading occurs inthe tissues.
