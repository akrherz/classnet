===message:I think the cone concentration in the center of our eyes is to give us the best vision for those things that are in the center of our field of view. WHen hunting prey, swinging through a tree, or battling a foe having a good sharp picture of what is in front of us is important. Peripheral vision is less important, but not something that can be eliminated. To keep the eye a reasonable size, evolutionary pressures were probably balanced to yield what we have today.
