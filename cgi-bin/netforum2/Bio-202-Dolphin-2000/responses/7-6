===message:Usually when I think of a functional group, it is sticking off to the side where it can react with something, i.e. it can function as a group. When you find them in the middle of a molecule, it usually means they have reacted with something, and a larger molecule has formed. It would still remain a functional group although it might be thought of as having new properties.
