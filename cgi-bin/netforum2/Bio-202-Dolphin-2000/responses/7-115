===message:In theory any cell can be used as a nuclear donor. In practice, it has only been done with some cells. The reasons are not clear. but the general idea is that when a cell differentiates, some segments of its genes are turned off. We are only now learning how to chemically treat them to turn them back on. Cells that are used as nuclear donors are cells that actively divide. Intestinal cells are like this as are mammary cells subject to hormone dosages. Actively dividing cells in contrast to non-dividing cells cannot have permanent blockages of their genes because DNA must replicate before division. If you are really interested in a more detailed answer you need to look into the concept of the cell cycle. There is a phase known as G subzero which is beign investigated as a possible explanantion of how cells stop growing, i.e. is certain genes get turned off. If we know what is off, then we know what must be turned on.
