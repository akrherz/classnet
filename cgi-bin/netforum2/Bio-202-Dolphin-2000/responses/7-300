===message:These terms apply to what happens at the synapse. Temporal summation: when a single nerve inmpulse arrives at a synapse, neurotranmsitter is released. It effects the post-synaptic cell. Depending on the synapses integrating ability, the neurotranmsitter may or may not cause an action potential in the post-synaptic cell, i.e. it may or may not cause that cell to reach its threshold. After its release he neurotransmitter is broken down by an enzyme. The odel I will use is that a single  action potential arriving at a synapse causes transmitter release which causes a sub-threshold response in the post synaptic cell and then the transmitter is broken down. If a you have a second or third impulse (or several 100) that arrives immediately after the first, they will cause more neurotransmitter to be released before the first is broken down. This means the amount of neurotransmitter increases in the synapse. The combined amount may cause the post-synaptic cell to reach threshold and initiate an action potential. THis is temporal summation-the summation of effects over time involving high frequency impulses to a synapse causing the firing of a second cell. In spatial summation, you have a model as above but there are several pre-synaptic cells influencing one post-synaptic cell. A single impulse coming in any one of the presynatic cells will not cause the post-synaptic cell to fire. If impulses come in through several presynaptic cells at once, the combined release of trnamistter may be great enough to cause the post-synaptic cell to reach threshold and fire. SPatial summation therefore invloves several cells summing their effects to cause an action in a post-synaptic cell. THis will not be on the final.
