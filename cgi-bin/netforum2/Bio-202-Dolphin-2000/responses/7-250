===message:Deafness can have many different causes. Because of genetics or chemical ingested during pregnancy, the development of the ear can be effected. Anything that is involved in moving sound waves from the eardrum to the cochlea, that is involved in sensing sound in the cochlea, or that involves the auditory nerve to the brain (and I presume hearing centers in the brain) can cause deafness. You might talk with your aunt/uncle to see if the child has been tested to determine where the problem may be in the hearing pathway.
