===message:Just because God put us on the planet as the most dominant species doesn't mean we rule the world.  We just can't do something and say, oh we'll wipe out the whole monarch species with the GM crop, but that is o.k.  We aren't incharge of determining the existence of animals.  We need to find ways that benefits all of us and have little harm on the environment as possible.  It is o.k. to kill animals, but God forbid that we give humans allergic reactions to some food.  If they don't like it, don't eat it.

===message:Yes, human kind DO dominate the earth.  And we DO posses knowledge that is sometimes scary and could be deadly.  But, this is dealing with the building blocks of life itself.  I'm not looking at this from a religious point of view, but until we understand what the results of GM crops could do to the environment or human beings, I don't think we should rush.  Investigate, research and take it a bit slow.
