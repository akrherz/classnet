===message:A lot of people are working on memory research. I think a good place to look for some starting ideas on the kind of research going on is in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. THis monthly magazine is sort of the NAtional Geographic of science research. It publishes excellent reviews of research and willlead you inot the field. It is in the Library; ask at the desk in the Periodical Room. Use the annual indexes in one issue per year to look back a few years. Also try to Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature. There is always the ALta VIsta search engine for the WWW as well. All of these would be preliminary sources of info that will lead you to the real research papers in scientific journals.
