===message:Neurotransmitters bind to protein receptors imbedded in the post-synaptic cells membrane. The receptor with bound transmitter then affects Na and K ion gates leading to ion movement across the membrane. This changes the voltage potential across the membrane which may reach threshold and cause an action potential.
