===message:Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints which makes using them painful. It may actually involve deteriation of bone in the joint. I think there any many causes of these symptoms, some of which may hereditary. I would suhggest that you look on the WWW for info. THere is an Arthritis Society and I am sure they would have some good info. Beware of sites put up by individuals without medical credentials. Medicine is not perfect, but at least it is controlled.
