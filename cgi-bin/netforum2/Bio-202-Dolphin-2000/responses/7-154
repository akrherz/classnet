===message:As stated yawning is thought to provide extra oxygen through an occassional deep breath. DUring normal ventilation, many of the alveoli are not inflated and bllod may pass through the lungs without becoming well oxygenated. It is believed that this low oxygen concentration somehow triggers the yawning reflex, causing a deep breath to be taken. THis causes more alveoli to be inflated and presumably the O2 levels in the blood rise. Why a yawn seems contagious, I do not know. It may simply make us more conscious of our desire to yawn, but your guess is as good as mone.
