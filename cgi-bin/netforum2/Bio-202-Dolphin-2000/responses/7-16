===message:I am not sure that I can give you a definitive answer, but here are some ideas. When we get a fever, the temperature change is rather small, about 5 or 6 degree F max, or about 3 degree C. Such changes can affect metabolism and cell function, hence we often feel "lousy" or not right because things are functioning at different rates than they do at our normally carefully regulated temperature of 98.8 F. Whether this causes us to be ill longer, I cannot say. Illness is often related to toxins released by the infectuous agent, and the duration to the time it takes for the body's immune system to neutralize the agent and clear the toxins by action of the liver and kidneys.
