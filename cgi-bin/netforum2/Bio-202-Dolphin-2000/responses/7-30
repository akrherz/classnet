===message:I cannot think of a fucntional reason for the separation of the glycolysis from the other processes. Certainly, ETS requires a membrane compartment for chemiosmosis to work and hexokinase in step 1 of glycolysis conveerts glucose into a phosphorylated form that will not diffuse out of the cell, but I can think of no other reason other than an evolutionary one. Mitochondria are thought to have arisen from aerobic prokaryotes invading other cells that already had anaerobic metabolism back in the dim past (endosymbiont theory). THis would give you origins of glycolysis in the cytoplasm and Krebs/ETS in the mitochondria. IF there was no selection pressure to change because the arrangement worked just fine, it could have continued up until present time.
