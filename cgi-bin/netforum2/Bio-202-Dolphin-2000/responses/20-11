===message:Jared, I read your opinion on GM crops and how you believe they will help world starvation. In all actuality its not that we don't have enough food to feed the world already,but  its an issue of economics and HOW we use the food we do have.  Third world countries are starving because thay can't afford the high price countries like the US charge to export.  Even like here in the US for example, some people  are starving but not because the US has a food shortage but b/c they can't afford the high cost being put on our food supply. Furthermore if people were more conservative about the foods they choose to eat, the world would have a much higher output of food as a whole.  Yes, curing world hunger would be great, but it cannot be done through GM foods since the one's creating GM foods are the one's who put the higher dollar on food in the first place.
