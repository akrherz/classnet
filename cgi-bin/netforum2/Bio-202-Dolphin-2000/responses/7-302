===message:Not that I am a prude, but I truly do not know the answer to this one. Both males and females of many species will have multiple partners during the mating season, but this has been explained in terms of sperm competition and conception of offspring that will have quite different genes thus insuring the survivial. The female is selfish in this regard because it insures that her genes may survive. The male is also selfish in that he might inseminate a female whose genes in combination with his might be superior from a natural selection standpoint. Our pleasure at sex might derive from mating systems like this.
