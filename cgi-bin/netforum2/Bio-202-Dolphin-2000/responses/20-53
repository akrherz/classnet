===message:I agree that the reduced use of chemical pesticides was impressive, but is that really enough information to make you want to put these products into your body?  It is still too early to know for sure what long term effects these GM crops can have on people, the environment, and all organisms that inhabit the surrounding areas.  Shouldn't people have a right to decide for themselves whether or not they want to consume these products?  Labeling these products might solve a lot of debate, but still more expiramenting is neccessary to ensure the best intrests of all organisms involved.

===message:You have some good ideas for increasing the advantages for 
the human population but we are not the only beings on 
Earth.  I don't think that any harm should be done to living 
things for our benefit, beyond what is only natural.  You 
are correct that GM crops are extremely beneficial if they 
reduce the use of pesticides and herbicides.  This reduction 
is not only beneficial humans, like you reasoned.  
Pesticides and herbicides harm the environment as a whole, 
including plants and animals.   This problem cannot be 
solved using GM crops because they cause harm to other 
living organisms too.  If scientists could genetically 
modify a plant so it only has positive effects that would be 
a good solution, yet it is highly unlikely that this will 
ever happen!
