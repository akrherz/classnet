===message:The skeletal muscle return-pump system is needed when the body is upright and your feet are several feet (no pun!) below the heart. When you sleep, you usually are prone and the heart and feet are at the same level. Differences in level cause pressure differences and these must be overcome if blood is to return to the heart.
