===message:It is not the capillaries per se that constrict. It is the precapillary bed sphincter muscle in the arteriole supplying the capillary bed. These muscles are innervated by the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. They also respond to hormones such as adrenalin and they will respond to local chemical changes in the tissues where the arterioles are located. Rising body temperature will trigger the autonomic system to signal relaxation of muscle increasing capillary blood flow to surface areas (as well as sweating, panting, etc.). Cold wind blowing on your face may cause local chemical changes that leads to vasodilation in the area affected by the cold.
