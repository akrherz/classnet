===message:  I agree with you in a way.  I think that they should be further looked into and the effects of consuming the crops should be well studied also.  But since the future population is going to be so high, we need a way to produce more crops in the little area that we will have left.  If we didn't think of some way to improve the yields, then in 2025 when the population reaches 8 billion people, as pedicted, then there will be a great food shortage all over the world.
