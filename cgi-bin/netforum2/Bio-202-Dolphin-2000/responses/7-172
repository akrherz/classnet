===message:I am not a specialist on cancer. However, I think they removed several nodes to be sure. When canecers develop and metastasize some cells leave the area of cancerous growth and enter the open ends of the lymphatic capillaries. They pass along these and often take up residence in the nodes where they continue to divide forming new centers of camcer. There is no way of looking at a node during surgery and determining if it contains small numbers ofcancerous cells. This can only be done by taking the node, sectioning it and looking at it under a microscope. NOdes which contain large numbers of cancerous cells will be enlarged. I am not sure of the long term effects on health. I think that the defenses of some one who has several nodes removed may be somewhat reduced but still adequate for normal life.
