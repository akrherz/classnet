===message:The muscles in these structures are innervated by the autonomic nervous system. That is why your faces flushes when you are nervous, or whern you are hot. In addition, these muscles seem to be able to respond to local conditions so that a high local CO2 level may cause dilation without ANS stimulation. The biomechanics are that you have circular muscle around the arteriole. It contract and closes the arteriole; nothing complex.
