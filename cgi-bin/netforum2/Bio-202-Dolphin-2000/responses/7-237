===message:Excellent question Melissa.
You have good "reflexes" if you are able to sprint well.  Your muscles respond quickly to an action potential.  Distance runners can't neccessarily not sprint well, but they have more stamina than you do.  You use all your energy quickly while sprinting, and the distance runner knows how to conserve some energy for the long race ahead.

===message:JOe has correctly described part of what is involved. In muscles you have both red and white fibers. Red fibers (cells) are aerobic and are red because they have myoglobin that stores oxygen and  lots of mitochondria which use oxygen. Red fibers metabolize fats through the Krebs cycle and electron transport system. THey have a good blood supply. They allow for slow responses. WHite fibers have less of what was described and glycogen. Their blood supply may be poor.  They metabolize glucose anaerobically.  Any given skeletal muscle like the triceps femoris is a mixture of the two fiber types. Distance runners typically have more red fibers. Whether a muscle is red or white depends on the nerves that innervate it. In fact you can surgically change nerves around so that what was a white muscle becomes red and vice versa when a different type of nerve is grafted to it. I cannot say whether you are genetically predisposed to being a distance runner, but certainly genetics would influence the types of fibers found in your muscles.
