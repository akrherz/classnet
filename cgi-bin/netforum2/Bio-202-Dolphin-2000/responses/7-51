===message:In a sample of sperm, you would expect to get DNA from several cells, not just one. The several cell sample would be representative of the DNA in several somatic cells. This is in distinction to fertilization where there is only one sperm contributing DNA. The individual cells in the collection of sperm differ from each other due to crossing over, segregation and independent assortment. The only one of these factors that could influence restriction patterns of DNA from a sample of several cells would be crossing over. In this process pieces of DNA are reciprocally exchanged. If the cross over points happened to be also restriction sites for the endonucleases, then it is possible that something other than a true fingerprint would be obtained. Fingerprinting is not exact, and must be interpreted. These interpretations are put together with other evidence in a criminal case.
