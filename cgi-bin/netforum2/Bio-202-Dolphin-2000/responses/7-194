===message:Think of the the constant region as a lollypop stick and the variable region as the different kinds of candy that can attached. One gene codes for both the constant and the variable region of one type of antibody. Several antibody genes have the same constant region but different variable regions. This ia caused by a recombination process in the genome where different "candies" are shuffled in and attached to the "stick" region of the gene. Once the gene is formed by the combination of constant and variable sequences, it expresses itself as an antibody through protein synthesis.
