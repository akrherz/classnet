===message:The stick contains anitbodies to human chorionic gonadotrophic hormone, HCG hormone. If the stick contacts HCG it binds it and this makes a dye turn color. A woman produces HCG only if pregnant; she does not produce antibodies. The HCG is acting as an antigen and it is to the antibody manufactured and attached to the stick. I am not sure of the reasons for variable response to the test. Possibly it is due to differences in the HCG that different woman produce. I do not know the reliability estimates on the test. You can read about how the antibody is prepared on page 856 of your text.
