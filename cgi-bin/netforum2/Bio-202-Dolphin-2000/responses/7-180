===message:Cow pox is a disease with milder symptoms than human small pox. It is caused by a virus. We now know that these two viruses are related, i.e. one arose from the other by mutation. Hence they have similar surface antigenic properties. If a human is exposed to cow pox their immune system produces antibodies to it. The antibodies cross react with small pox viruses and convey immunity to that disease, if the person is later exposed to it. I think there many viral caused diseases that have jumped species lines. HIV is thought to come out of primates in Africa. Several flus have come out of other animals; recently swine and chickens in Asia were destroyed to prevent possible spread of some disease. Sorry, I cannot remember details. ####Send me an E-mail at wdolphin with some times we could meet to discuss the solar car. Are you thinking chlorophyll and ATP!
