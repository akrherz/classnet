===message:INtersting idea, but ther eis not enough time. When youingest cycnide it goes to your cells and binds to the cyctochrome oxidase in your mitochondria throughout your body. This is a compound in the ETS, electron tramnsport system. It shuts down, metabolism backs up, you produce no ATP, you die in a few minutes after exposure. Ther is not time to get the bacteria and ingest them. If you did ingest them, they would die in the acid of your gut, but if by some chance they survived, they would not get to your mitochondria which are inside your cells while the bacteria are in thre gut and not spread through the body by circulation.
