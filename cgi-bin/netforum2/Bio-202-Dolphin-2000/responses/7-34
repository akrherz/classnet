===message:In general courses we speak of ATP as being a universal currency for energy in cells. This is generally true. GTP is another currency that is used as well. If you look at the bottom of the Kreb's cycle illustration in your book, you will see that GTP is made first in the Krebs cycle and then it can transfer its high energy phosphate to ATP. Thus, it is true that ATP is made. AS you study biochemistry, you will see GTP crop up in other places as well. The synthesis of all nucleic acids requires energy as order is made from disorder. All nucleotides enter into the reaction as triphosphates, losing two phsophates when the bond is made to the elongating nucleic acid strand. Sometimes these triphosphates are made from metabolic pathways as is GTP but other times they are made by taking a monophosphate form of the nucleotide and using two ATPs to add the required phosphates to get UTP, TTP, CTP, ATP or GTP.
