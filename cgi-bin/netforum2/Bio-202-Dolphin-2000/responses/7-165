===message:Many microorganisms and plants produce vitamin K. The pathway of biosynthesis is very complex.  Vitamin K is a quinone, and if you are interested, you could look the bioosynthetic pathway up in an advanced biochemistry book.. I do not know what function it serves in mircroorganisms. The E. coli that produce it in all vertebrate digestive systems live in the large intestine or caecum, not in the rectum.
