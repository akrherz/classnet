===message:There is always some confusion on the basic definitions. The skin and other non-specific defenses are often lumped in with the immune system for introductory courses. I prefer to think of the immune system as the specific humoral and cell response systems involving antibodies that are secreted or held on cell surfaces. THe non-specific systems are simply defense mechanisms.
