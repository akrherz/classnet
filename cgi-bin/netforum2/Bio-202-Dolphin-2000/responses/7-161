===message:The cues for leaf drop are both temperature and length of photoperiod. If temperatures were higher than normal, many trees would still lose their leaves because of natural selection synchronized leaf drop with reducing daylength as well. The reason for this, is that it allows plants to recover nutrients from leaves before they drop. If it was freezing alone that was trigger, leaf cells would be dead and there would no potential for recovery of critical nutrients. If global warming continued, I would expect that N. hemisphere plants would still drop leaves, but spome might begin to hold leaves longer than others. This is what happens in S. USA where there is no frost. Also plants would leaf-out earlier and there would be no selction against if there were no early frosts.
