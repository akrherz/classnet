===message:I don't agree with you on this issue.  Anytime there is a chance that something that humans did may effect the food chain the answer to weather we should use it or not should be easy.  We don't need it, we've been doing fine in terms of food production for a long time.  The effects of just a few butterflies being killed off could be astronomical.  We won't know until it's too late.
