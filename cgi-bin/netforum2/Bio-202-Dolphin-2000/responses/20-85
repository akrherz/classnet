===message:I agree with you somewhat, but not all the way.  First of all, GM crops aren't worth it if it harms the environment, and to some extent, humans.  Another reason is that it might make farmers money at first, but after while, it won't because the yield of crops will be so high that the prices at the grocery stores will be outrageoulsy cheap.  I think we need to find environmentally save ways to keep out crops from being destroyed from bugs.

===message:I agree with you in a way.  As you describe it, the farmers do have the possibility to lose in the long run.  I think before you get too far ahead of yourself though, more testing should be done before this can even be considered a problem.  If the GM crops are found to hurt the enviornment and a  farmer is using them, the farmer will lose even more.  I believe that there should be extensive testing before the GM crops can even be released to the consumers.
