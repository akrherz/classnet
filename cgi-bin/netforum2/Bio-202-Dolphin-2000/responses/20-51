===message:I agree that the farmer will end up paying the most for the overreacting that consumers have done.  Whether it is with the added time of making sure their crop doesn't mix with non GM crops or the expense of using the expensive herbicides.  The most important person, the farmer, is the one being left out of all the discussions bewteen the seed companies and the shippers.  If the GM foods are labled or not, there is definitly going to be backlash and the farmer will have to pay with his crops.

===message:I think the farmer issue you bring up here is so often overlooked that it is almost forgotten about.  In most places, the rhetoric about genetically modified crops can go on and on without even a thought about the farmer.  Here in Iowa, where the farmers effected by these changes call home, is where the economic issues of genetically altered crops really show thier merit.
