===message:I do agree that GM crops should be extensively researched and studied. People need to know what they are buying and eating.  In some ways GM crops may be helpful, but I still think that it is too risky to have them out on the market. Yes, that it a good analogy, they are like a drug and need to be treated like one.  But in the end, is all that research really worth all the effort????

===message:I agree with you also. Although most people don't view gm crops to be "drugs" as you called them, treating them as such may not be a bad idea. You can never be to careful, and especially with the things that you choose to eat. We are talking life and death here people.
