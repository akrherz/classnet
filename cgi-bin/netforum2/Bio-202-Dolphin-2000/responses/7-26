===message:THere are enzymes that break peptide bonds in other enzymes. Many enzymes are susceptible to such breakdown when they are not binding to their substrates, i.e. the active site is free. This is a neat control mechanism. If there is no substrate, the enzyme is not needed and its amino acids can be recycled to make other proteins. Use those old bricks over again! Proteins also spontaneously breakdown.
