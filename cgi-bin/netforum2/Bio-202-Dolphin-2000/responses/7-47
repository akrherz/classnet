===message:Look at Figure 5.27 in your text, thegreen section on sugars. Note that chemist assign a number to each of the carbons in the ring structure of the sugar.       


Next look at Figure 16.5 in the center. See how the sugars make up the backbone of the DNA double helix. Look at the sugars on the left. Note that you have a 3' hydroxyl at the bottom and 5' phosphate at the top. The right hand chain is just the reverse. Look at Figure 17.6 and the cartoon of RNA synthesis. Note the new bases are always added on the 3' end of the sugars making up the backbone.        

DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a growing nucleic acid in replication or transcription. The reason is that the phosphates are always attached to the 5' end of the incoming nucleotide and it reacts with the hydroxyl of the last nucleotide added to the growing molecule.       

If this is confusing , see me after class.
