===message:WHen acid refluxes into the esophagus, it causes a burning sensation which is near the heart: hence the name. A leaky cardiac sphincter (the on at the stomach entrance) will cause this as will excessive gas in the stomach (too many cokes) or too much food/fluid in the stomach as a large meal.
