===message:You are very observant. These photos come from an article published by Miller and Beatty in 1969 in Science 164:955, Fig 2. YOu can check out their interpretation. The photo is of rRNA genes being transcribed in an oocyte of spotted newt. This would be a in a nucleolus within a nucleus. They could very well be a protein complexing with the ends and represent an early step in ribosome formation or it could be the rRNA starting to fold into its working shape. It would not be histones because they are invloved in DNA spooling not RNA folding. 

There is another classic picture that I wish I could find again. It shows DNA in a bacterium being trnascribed into mRNA which as it elongates gathers ribosomes which begin to translate it before transcription is finished. Consequently you see DNA trunks, mRNA branches with ribosome nodes where there are protein "needles" being made.
