===message:The fact that you are wondering about bonding patterns is excellent, because hydrogen bonding between the bases in DNA (and RNA) is the key to understanding replication, transcription, and codon/anticodon interaction in translation. It answers why there are base pairing rules: G=C, A=T, A=U in RNA where the equal sign indicates what pairs with what. The reason is that A can form two hydrogen bonds with T or U but none with G or C. And G can form three hydrogen bonds with C but none with A, T or U. This is illustrated in Figures 16.5 and 16.6 in your text. Because of this specificity in hydrogen bonding, DNA or RNA can serve as templates for  synthesis allowing the information to be "copied," although in a mirror image form according to the base pairing rules.
