===message:When osmosis occurs into a closed container like a cell, water passes through the membrane until the pressure in the cell builds to a point that it stops. This occurs because the increasing pressure in the closed container (a fixed volume) increases the kinetic energy of the water in the container so that the rate of movement of water out of the cell equals the movement into the cell, therefore no net gain or loss. Reverse osomosis is an engineering application of this phenomenon. If water gain can be stoppped by increasing pressure, then water loss from the container can occur by artificially increasing the pressure above the equilibrium point described above. Water can be desalinated by putting it in a container that has an artificial membrane on one side. This membrane allows the passage of water molecules but not NaCl. The salt solution is pressurized and water is driven through the membrane, essentially "filtering" the salt out of the water. This is used to obtain drinking water by Saudi's to produce water for their desert environment from the ocean, and by the military for water for troops or in submarines that stay submerged for months at a time.
