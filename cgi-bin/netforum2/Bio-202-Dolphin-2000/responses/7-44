===message:I do not know enough about the structural chemistry to say if they must be this way or not. You might find some answers by going back the original papers on DNA structure. It would seem to me that the answer could be gotten experimentally by preparing some single stranded DNA that was all T  and mixing it with some single strands that were all A. If there is not a steric hinderance, you would expect mixtures of parallel and antiparallel. I am not sure how you would measure parallelness either, but some physical chemist must know.
