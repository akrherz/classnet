===message:I really think that this issue is being taken too far.  And you made a good point saying that pestisides are just as harmful.  I think people fail to realize how much we are harming the enviornment right now.  Bugs are being wiped out, people are being harmed.  I mean come on, even Dr. D ran through the truckloads of DDT.  It has since been removed from the farming industry, but there are still so many more harmful pestisides out there that I am sure are harming us as we speak.  So, maybe we should just be educating on how to avoid running through the pestisides because I don't think that they will ever be banned.

===message:I agree with you Melissa, the Europeans are taking precautions that could prevent a disaster.  I also think that some GM crops could be benificial too.

===message:You have an interesting poing here, but however, don't you think that what they are proposing to do with our crops has to be taken more rationally.  Think about all the organisms in our ecosystem that could be harmed by this thinking.  Yes, some pesticides are bad, but also, these GM crops that they are proposing are not that much better right now either.  There needs to be more research conducted in order to follow through with their proposal.  As stated in the articles, most farmers don't spray because it rarely protects the corn.  If we were to propose these new ides, what would happen then if a resistance developed?

===message:I agree, messing with nature can't be all good.  But the chemical herbicides and other stuff like that cant be great either.  Until there is more evidence who knows???
