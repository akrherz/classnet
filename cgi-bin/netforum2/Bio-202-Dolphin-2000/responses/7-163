===message:Hemophilia is caused by an impaired ability of the blood to clot. Consequently it is called bleeder's disease. There are well over a dozen protein "factors" that are needed for blood to clot normally. If one is missing, clotting may take longer or not take place at all. You know the story from earlier in the semester, proteins are the result of expression of genes. There must be over a dozen genes that produce the proteins mentioned above. A mutation in any one could impair clotting. A severe hemophiliac probably will die quite early because normal wear and tear or minor injuries could be fatal. Others with less severe symptoms, may be able to get treatments and drugs that overscome the mutation that they carry so that injuries are not fatal. However, they must be very careful.
