===message:I agree with your paragraph.  I can also see the benefits, but the scientists must be very careful and cautious before they attempt to make these crops.

===message:Well obviously this whole Bt corn thing is something new and wonderful to us but before long everyone will realize that it isn't that big of a deal so farmers want a crop to produce a bigger yeild and more times a year. What's the big deal the monarch butterfly does not only live near cornfields and of course when the population dwithers to low we will as you said do something about that so to your opninion add mine I agree.

===message:Kristy, I do not think your idea of overlooking the killing of the Monarch butterflies until the population becomes threateningly low, is a good one.

===message:I fully agree with your statement, "GM crops may one day be very valuable to the human population."  GMOs are a very realistic solution to the mounting problem of world hunger.  However, I strongly disagree with your suggestion to overlook the Monarch butterfly problem until their population becomes "threateningly low."  A better idea I believe would be to keep extremely close tabs on this situation.  We should be concerned about the monarch butterfly not only for conservation's sake but also for our own sake.  To neglect to conserve the species diversity on earth would carry terrible unforeseen consequences in the future.

===message:I agree. I also believe that GM crops have both benefits and risks. I believe that one day the benefits will outweigh the risks, but at this point in time it is difficult for me to say. I believe there needs to be more research and experimentation done before it gets out of hand. I feel that we might be releasing a monster that we won't be able to control, but if we back off and don't rush the process, we will one day be able to reap the benefits of our technology.

===message:I think that you are putting all the benifets of GM crops up on a pedestal and pushing the downfalls aside.  I don't agree with you when you say that we should just overlook the killing of Monarch butterflies.  If we overlook one species of animal, what would we be overlooking next?  A few humans dying because of genetically modified crops?
