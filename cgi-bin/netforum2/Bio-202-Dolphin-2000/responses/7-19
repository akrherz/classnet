===message:I am not cetain of the answer here, but I am reasponably sure that it is not simply a matter of saturated fats being directly used and therefore packing tight to form plaques. WHat we take in our diet is modified through metabolism. Therefore hardening of arteries could be a result of changes made in the fatty acids. I am sure that a lot has been written about this. You might start by checking the WWW through a search engine to see if anyone has pposted something. However, be careful what you take as gospel from the WWW. It is not reviewed before publication.
