===message:These air plants are epiphytes, plants that grow on other plants. If you travelled in the rain forests of Costa Rica or Australia on one of International Field trips in Biology, you would see ferns, mosses, dicots and monocots that are adapted to this way of life. Frequently if you examine where they are attached to the tree or "host", you will find leaves trapped. These leaves hold moisture and release nutrients such as PO4, Ca, Mg, NO3, and NH3. There will be some type of root system in this mass. If there is not a leaf mass, then the roots will penetrate the bark of a host tree. SOme tree avoid becoming hosts by shedding their bark seasonally. ALso some epiphytes are lichens and do not have roots. The thalli absorb moisture and nutrients from bits and pieces of decaying leaves that are caught. One last observation: you see these types of plants in moist areas where an extensive root system is not needed to collect moisture.
