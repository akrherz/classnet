===message:Yeah, I agree that there are some advantage and disadvantage of the genetically modified crops.  I think the idea was great, it may higher crop yields and we can get many other benefit from them, but the safety of GM crops and its impact  on the enviroment are still uncertain.  What i think would be the best way is that the researchers and scientsts should do more works on data collections and assessing the ecological risks before the GM products are put on the market.

===message:I still maintain that we don't know enough (and can't know enough) to do anything along the lines of Bt corn, but I admit that it never occurred to me that we could use the techniques to do something small like add vitamins to a crop.  That would definitely be something I could find acceptable--except what would that do to the other animals that feed on the crops we produce?  Do we really want extremely well-nourished corn bores?  (Or would it even make a difference?)  Putting pesticides into plants naturally just has way too many potential dangerous effects, though, so I agree with you that we shouldn't be doing that.  I'm still going to say that messing with the genomes of things we release into the world at large isn't a very good idea, as we can't know what the consequences would be.  Perhaps GM crops which could be grown (by law, not by engineering) only in special netting which would keep the pollen from escaping into the general environment?

===message:I agree with what you have to say on this subject, but I also believe with more testing and working on how they modify these plants that they will perfect it so that the pesticide won't be any more harmful than what is already used by farmers right now.  The dangers of using them are harmful too, but we still use them, don't we??
