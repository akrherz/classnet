===message:I think that you have to say that harvesting sap "hurts" (better to say does not benefit) the maples. Most likely, they will grow a little slower because there is less energy available to fuel leaf out and bud growth. This is why "mature" trees are tapped. I do not think you can kill a tree by tapping, although I suppose you could stick enough spigots around the periphery to take all of the sap: that would be lethal.
