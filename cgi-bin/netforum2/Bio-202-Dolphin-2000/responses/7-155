===message:The umbilical cord characterizes placental mammals. It essentiall contains arteries and veins that conduct blood to and from the placenta where nutrient, gas, and dissolved waste exchage occur with teh mother's capillaries. AT the first breath following birth, an involuntary reflex closes the artery passing out through the umbilical cord. No more blood flows through the arteries and veins in the umbilical cord. OVer time, these vessels in the abdominal cavity fill with connective tissue. The unbilical arteries become the lateral umbilical ligaments on the free borrder of the bladder. The umbilical vein becomes the round ligament of the liver and the ligamentum venosum in the liver. No doubt there is programmed cellular death that occurs along with this, and the breakdown products of cells are absorbed by other cells in the newborn. Nothing "finds" its way into the digestive system.
