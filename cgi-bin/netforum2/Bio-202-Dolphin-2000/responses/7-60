===message:VIruses do not locomote. They are air- or waterbourne from one location to another. They are very small, much smaller than cells, and will drift in the air or water. When shed from a lysing cell they may enter the environment directly when the infected organism dies, be voided in urine or feces,  be aspirated in breathing, or tansfered in a body fluid exchange--insect bite, transfusion, activities related to sex.
