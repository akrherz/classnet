===message:Nice experimental hypothesis thinking! If you ssuspend the pot upside down, stems should emerge from the seed and make a 180 degree turn and head up (back into the soil although they might not penetrate). Roots should grow down but may not exit the soil because they also show negative phototropism and grow away from a light source. Why don't you talk to your TA in lab and ask if you could set up a fast plant quad to test your idea? Tell the TA I said to do it.
