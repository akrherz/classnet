===message:I agree with you that if there are no side effects in either human health or nature we should use them to conserve our land from pesticides and help to prevent water contamination from these chemicals.

===message:It makes sense to set strict regulations for GM crops, but how do you deem one as acceptable and one as unacceptable?  Many of the effects they may have on the environment and humans might not show up for many years, just as many detrimental effects of pesticides did not surface until decades after their implementation.
	Also, as with pesticides, most GM crops are altered so they carry a gene that kills or hurts an organism.  Pesticides can not be made organism specific- can GM crops?  I understand the dose of the "poison" may be smaller to be targeted towards small organisms, but the plants still carry toxins.

===message:I agree with the fact that all research put forth to GM crops should not be disallowed just because of certain side affects, and that we need to proceed with caution. I think that the benefits are too high for us as a society to just brush aside the possibilities that lay in front of us, but I also think that certain products have been released which may not have been researched well enough, and are now causing environmental problems.
