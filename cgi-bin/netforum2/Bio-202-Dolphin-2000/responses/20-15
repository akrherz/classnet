===message:I don't entirely agree with Thomas on the wonderfulness of GM crops.  The downsides are enormous, the fact we have the power to throw off the equilibrium of the world is a scary thought.  I think researchers shouldn't act until they have forseen all possibilities- good and bad.

===message:I agree that GMO's would reduce the use of pesticides resulting in a better world for all of us.  But what about the possibility of disease outbreaks because of the antibitic resistance virsu.  Also think about the ecoystem...every living organism plays a significant part in the food chain.  Upsetting this sensitive system, I believe we are playing with fire.  Until GMO's are reasearched better, they should not be put out on the market.  There are more issues than pesticides to be considered when deciding whether or not these products should be used.
