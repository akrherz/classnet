===message:Color blindness can result from a number of things. Certainly if you lack cones, or cones that have a pigment for receiving a particular color, you will have impaired color vision or none. The pigments for absorbing colored light are part protein. Mutations in the genes that determine these proteins, may yield color blindness even though the cells and pigment are present. Red-Green colorblindness is reasonably common and is inherited as a sex linked trait.
