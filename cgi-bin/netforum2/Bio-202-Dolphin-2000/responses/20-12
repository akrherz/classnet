===message:I also don't think that we are ready for GM crops.  There just isn't enough evidence to proe that they are safe and won't harm the environment.  I also don't think we can afford to destroy any more animals, it may have long term affects on the world.

===message:I agree with you.  Even though the idea may have good cause, the outcomes so far are more against it than for it.  Since Europe is against buying GMOs and ADM is not storing them, it seems like we are losing money.  If countries change their minds, then maybe there is hope for GMOs, and if the effects on the environment can be worked out too.
