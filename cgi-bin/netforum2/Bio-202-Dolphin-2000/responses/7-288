===message:Deafness can be due to problems with any  part of the sound pathway or nerve damage. Damaged auditory nerves cannot be fixed. Damaged ear bones and membranes can be surgically fixed. Damaged hair cells cannot be fixed or replaced. Damaged membranes in the cochlear canals would be difficult or impossible to fix because the cochlea is imbedded in the skull and darn hard to get to without causing massive damage. Hearing aids can often compensate for problems with certain frequecies by taking sounds and shifting the pitch to one that can be heard or by amplification. While we understand the ear, the size of the receptors are small and they are in a confined area. This limits what can be done.
