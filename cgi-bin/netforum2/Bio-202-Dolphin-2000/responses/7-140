===message:If you injected the cellulase into the blood stream, nothing would happen (although there is a possibility of anaphylatic shock) . If you somehow introduced it into the digestive system (stomach or duodenum), there is a possibility that it would digest cellulose in food depending on cellulase's pH and temperature optima and its resistance to other digestive enzymes that break down proteins. If it worked, glucose would be produced. Glucose obtained this way would be indistinguishable from glucose coming from other sources.
