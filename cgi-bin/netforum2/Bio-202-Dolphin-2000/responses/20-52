===message:Perhaps Darren is right that we don't NEED new methods of growing crops.  After all, things are just fine the way they are, right?  But I wonder - how can we ever improve if we don't try new things.  How can we ever advance in science if we don't test hypotheses and use the knowledge that we have?  Though there may be risks involved with GMO's there also may be many benefits - including having more food to supply to underdeveloped countries and using fewer pesticides.  If the scientists around the world were to simply close the doors on the possibilities of this new technology, then we would never know whether or not GMO's could make the world a better place.

===message:I definitely agree with you and understand your points!  
There is plenty of food available and why fix something that 
is not broken especially if there is a chance that it will 
cause harm to other living things?  Just because scientists 
have figured out how to do some of this awesome technology, 
doesn't mean they should. Some people need to realize that 
humans are not the center of the universe and they cannot 
tamper with the DNA of other living organisms just to 
satisfy their needs

===message:I will have to disagree with Darren and agree with Anna's reply.  GMOs are just starting to be studied.  Sure, there may be some negative effects at first but you can't stop studying them and improving them.  Where would we be if we would just stop improving things when there where some negative effects?  And I do have to correct one thing that Darren said in his opinion: there is not a food surplus.  There may be one in the United States but there are many people around the world in underdeveloped countries that are starving and dying because they do not receive enough food.  There was a small section in the article that mentioned that GM crops could help these people get the nutrition that they need.
