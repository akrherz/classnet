===message:All-in-all, I definitely agree with you that all genetically engineered crop species do need to undergo testing before they are deemed suitable for the marketplace, but I do question the comment about the effects these things could have on humans.  First off, nothing has been shown to lead anyone to believe that there actually are harmful side effects to humans because of this technology.  Are we to completely hold-up the implementation of these crops while we go through years upon years of testing to search for something that has yet to ever show up.  Humans suffered no effects when farmers started cross-breeding for different traits, so they also shouldn't see any harmful effects from these products either.
