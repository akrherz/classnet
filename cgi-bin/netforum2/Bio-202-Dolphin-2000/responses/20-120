===message:I agree totally!  They are a good idea and I think we should take advantage of this technology.  I would approve of FDA or USDA regulation and monitoring to avoid severe effects that could occur by greedy individuals or corporations that don't disclose all the side effects or possible risks.  Then we, as educated consumers, can decide if we want to use the products.
