===message:I am not sure, but I think it could. Intensity of light and spectral distribution of light is important in the light flash that effects long night plants. If lightning gave the right ampnts of these then it could affect them. However, it only resets the clock and they will bloom later. In the poinsettia example I gave in class, having poinsettias bloom in January is too late for the florist.
