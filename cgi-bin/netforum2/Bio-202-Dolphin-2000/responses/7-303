===message:I am not a doctor nor do I have all of the information on this injury. HOwever, I suspect what happened is that the connective tissue sheath that surrounds the muscle cells that are bundled together developed a tear. When the healing occured, some of the muscle cells were partially outside of the sheath. I suspect it is a long term condition, and may become painful in older age. In strenuous muscle activity, we often tear connective tissues. The Achilles tendon that passes over th eheal can be torn when spsrinting because the weight of the body and the force of muscle contraction all focus on that tendon where it inserts into the heal. The lesson is to be learned, is that there are limitations in terms of biomechanics. We can can push the envelope, but this shoiuld be done gradually and not in excess.
