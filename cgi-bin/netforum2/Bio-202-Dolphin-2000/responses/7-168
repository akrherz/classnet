===message:Aptosis does occur in many cells during development, i.e. cell death is programmed in the genes to occur at a particular time. In the immune system, aptosis is involved in the the development of self recognition. As lymphocytes are being formed for the first time (beginning), the genes for immunoglobulins (antibodies) are being assembled by taking existing bits and pieces of genes and putting them in new combinations to make a functional gene that codes for an antibody. We think it is a random process that can produce genes for millions of different types of antibodies from only a relatively few bits and pieces. SOme of these antibodies will recognize "self" and could bind with "self" inactivating cells and secreted proteins. Somehow when this happens, the cells producing these types of antibodies die off (aptosis). What is left is antibodies against the rest of the world but not against self. In autoimmune diseases, this mechansim fails and antibodies are produced against the person's own body tissues.
