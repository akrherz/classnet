===message:Regeneration means to grow over again. Think of a nerve cell body sending a thin cytoplasmic extension from your spine to your toes. It is virtually impossible for this to happen in an adult because of all of the tissues in the way and the fact that the microscopic growing nerve would have to find its way along your leg and into your foot. When a nerve is cut, there is a distal segment and a proximal segment (the part near the body's trunk). The proximal part has a nucleus, the distal part does not. If they do not rejoin the distal part will die for lack of a nucleus. Remember all cell bodies are in the CNS. WHen severed, the proximal and distal parts send out random cytoplasmic extensions. If one extension from a proximal finds one from a distal, they rejoin and the nerve is repaired. SUrgeons sew together large nerves in hopes that some rejoining of cells will occur, but recovery is rarely 100%. For spinal injuries, recovery rates in terms of restored function are extremely low. We are not sure why, but certainly would like to discover the secret so many acidents victims could be treated.
