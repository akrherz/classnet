===message:The condition you describe (and which I did) is farsightedness (myopia): can see things at a distance but not close. The most common cause of this in children is an eyeball that is too short so that light does not focus on the retina. However, it could be caused by lens hardening at an early age. It is corrected with a convex lens.
