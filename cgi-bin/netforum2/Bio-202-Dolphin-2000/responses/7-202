===message:THrseshold is a property of nerve and muscle cells. It is the minimum change in voltage across the membrane that will lead to an action potential. In the lab or a simulation, the threshold is defined as the strength of the stimulus needed to cause an action potential in a nerve. For you experimental setup, determine how to change the strength of the stimulus. CHange it to a low value and see if the nerve rsponds with an action potential. If it does, lower the stimulus strength. If  it does not, raise the stimulus strength. Keeping changing stimulus strength until you find the minimum needed to cause the nerve to fire an action potential. The voltage of teh stimulus required to do this is the threshold.
