===message:James is right that GM crops can be quite beneficial to the food supply and profitting of farmers and consumers as a result of the newly engineered products.  It is also a good point of his that it is foolish to send any product to market which has not been sufficiently researched.  Consumers should not have any worries about the quality of the foods they eat and should have confidence in the system that provides their food products.

===message:To relpy to both comments, I do agreee that the GM crops still need extensive testing and such before they go out onto the market.  But as a shopper to not worry about any of the food products out there is foolish, it would be nice, but unrealistic.  Many farmers will still use pesticides that have shown to harm animals and humans just to save a few extra dollars.  You may think you are getting a deal in the store but in the long run you may not.

===message:I agree completely.  GM crops have so much potential to improve crop production in many ways.  However, I think it is in our interest to proceed cautiously and make sure that we do not end up doing more harm than good.
