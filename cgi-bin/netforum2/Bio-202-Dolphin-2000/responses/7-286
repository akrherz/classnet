===message:The amounts of neurotransmitters and receptors in the brain do in fact determine and influence behavior. The problem in administering neurotransmitters is how do you get them to where they are needed at the instant they are needed. If you think of neurotransmitters as letters in the alphabet, administering a cocktail of neurotransmittrs would be like dumping a box of letters on the table: few of the arrangements would make any sense. Even if you could figure how to give the right transmitters at the right moment (measured in milliseconds) how do you get them to the right synapses in the brain? Acetylcholine is excitatory at some synapses adn inhibitory at others, etc.All of this said, we do know that certain drugs do influence synapses and these are administered to to alleviate depression and other chronic memtnal conditions with some success.
