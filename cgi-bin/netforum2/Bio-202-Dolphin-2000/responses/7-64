===message:Mothers do not share blood with the baby and the baby's blood type is determined by the genetics of the parents.--- The placenta brings capillaries from the mother very close to capillalries from the baby and materials diffuse across in both directions: Simplistically, nutrients to child and wastes to mother. These capillaries sometimes break due to normal activity; nothing serious just minor breakages. HOwever, this may allow a small amount of the mother's blood to enter the child"s circulatory system or vice versa. If that blood is carrying HIV the infection will occur. ALso during birth, there can be some contamination of the child's blood by the mother's.
