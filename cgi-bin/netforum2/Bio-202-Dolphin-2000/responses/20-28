===message:Even though it seems like a good idea right now, in the long run, the environment might be dramatically altered by the new crops.  Also I feel that it may hurt our economy, since Europe is against the buying of GMOs.  Where is the US going to sell these crops, to the poorer countries, the ones that are starving.  By doing this, the US might be losing money in the future.  I feel that testing is ok, but more tests need to be done, and maybe if Europe would start to buy GMOs, then there would be a chance.

===message:You say that GM crops will produce mass yields reducing the cost.  However genetically engineering crops is an expensive process.  Think about all of the research that goes into it.  Another thing is that third world countries will probably not be able to use GM crops since it cost too much.  Therefore some parts of the world will thrive while others will be left to the customary ways of farming.  Also the long term effects of GM crops are still unknown.  What if more mutations are created and what if we harm other organisms?  I think there's a lot to think about with genetic engineering then just the fact of reducing costs.
