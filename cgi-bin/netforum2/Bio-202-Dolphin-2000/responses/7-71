===message:A bacteriophage, sometimes referred to as a phage,  is a virus that infects bacteria. It will not attack other types of cells. A provirus is something different. It is a virus whose DNA inserts into the host cell's DNA and is carried there and replicated in a lysogenic life cycle. Think of it as a life cycle stage. Most viruses, including phages, can have become a provirus, i.e. their DNA can insert in the host cell genome. I used viruses that infect humans as my example, but proviruses are not limited to eukaryotes. Read pages 323 and 324 of your text for a fuller decription.
