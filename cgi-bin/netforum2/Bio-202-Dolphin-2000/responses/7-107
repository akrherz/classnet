===message:Wow, you really went to a Bio lecture at PSU! Great! THere is a difference between girding a tree and cutting a hole through it. When you gird, you cut all of the functioning vascular tissue completely around the tree. WHen you cut a hole, even a big one, you still have functioning vascular tissue on the side walls. If you knew the width of the opening and the dimaeter of the tree, you could do a little calculation to determine the amount of vascular tissue left: 


% left= (Pi X diameter- 2 X width of opening)/ Pi X diameter

You could do an estimated calculation from your recollection of the picture. The hole is probably about 8 feet across. How much was left to the side? About 4 feet? Then diameter is 12 feet. THe calculation becomes (3.14X12 - 2X8)/ 3.14X12= ~55%

If half of vascular system is intact, tree will survive, although it will grow more slowly. Holes in walls of xylem and radial rays of xylem and phloem will allow water and nurients to cross from continuous vascular tissue to vascular tissues that are interupted. Vascular cambium above the hole will continue to contribute to secondary growth of trunk above opening.
