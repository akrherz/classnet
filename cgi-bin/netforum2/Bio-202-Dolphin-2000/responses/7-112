===message:Good question and one that can be extended to other plants like vines that "climb" the trunks of trees by growing in an upward spiralling fashion. AT the cellular level, the growth towards an object is caused by cell elongation on the side opposite where the contact is made so that the plant part curves toward the object that was touched. This will occur only at the tip when new cells are being made. The respnse to touch if called thigmotropism. Studies have shown that touching plants repeatedly ( as plants blowing in the wind and touching a wire mesh) will activate certain genes that lead to the synthesis of a calcium binding protein called calmodulin. These results suggest that Ca++ are somehow involved, but I do not believe that the actual receptor system has been described. You might check Biological Abstracts (remember root hairs?) under the search term thigmomorphogenesis to see what the latest research is saying.
