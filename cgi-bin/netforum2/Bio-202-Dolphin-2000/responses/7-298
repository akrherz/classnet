===message:Red blood cells are filled with the protein hemoglobin; that is what makes them red. Oxygen diffuses across the RBC membrane and loosely binds with hemoglobin inside the RBC when oxygen concentration is high as in the lungs. The RBC is whisked by the circulation to the tissues where oxygen concentration is low. AT low concentration, oxygen dissociates from hemoglobin and diffuses out of the cell into the tissues where it is used in aerobic respiration.
