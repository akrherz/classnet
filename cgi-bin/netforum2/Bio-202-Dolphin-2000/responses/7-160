===message:Clots usually do form in the vessels because the clotting mechanism is iniated by damaged tissue. SInce pressure flow is out of vessels, clotting initiating factors do not leak into vessels. When vessels are severed, clots will develop at severed ends. When vessels are niked, clot will form on wall allowing flow to continue. What is amazing is that severed vessels will grow back together or new vascularization will develop in an area of injury, eventually restoring blood flow.
