===message:If define cancer as abnormal growths, the answer is yes, plants can get cancer. Think about the galls that form on trees and sometimes mishapen growths on other plants. It could result from and over production of one or another hormone or from changes in genes that regulate cell divsion and differentiation. Some viruses that infect plants can have this effect, possibly by transduction.
