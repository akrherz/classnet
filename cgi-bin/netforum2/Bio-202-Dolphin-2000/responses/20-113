===message:very good point, i think much of the reason farmers are so eager to use these GM crops is because they can make an extra dollar by doing so. this is something all of us can understand, but it is also a question of ethics when these crops could potentially effect everyone's lives

===message:I totally agree with what you're saying. This debate is totally about how much money can we make out of this technology instead of being How could this technology help improve the lives of millions of people. Think about it if this technology was as revolutionary as they claimed it to be it will already be at the hands of everybody. Instead it is still being controled by the power countries of the world.

===message:Not much in this world done for non-profit...that is just the harsh reality.   However that doesn't mean that everyone is only thinking about the dollar. Granted that may be thier motovation but there are still companies with morals and ethics.  I  believe this to be true with GOM's and although the farmers incomes are increased, I think their original intentions were genuine.
