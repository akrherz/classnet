===message:Receptor cells are different cells than sensory neurons. A normal stimulus causes a graded potential change in a receptor cell, depending onthe strength of the stimulus. The graded potential may lead to an action potential in an the associated sensory nerve if the receptor cell causes the sensory cell to reach threshold. Receptor cells influence sensory cells either by releasing neurotranmitter or electrically.
