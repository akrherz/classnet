===message:I think that GMOs are safe for our environment. However, I am cautious because I think we may experience some problems, but they may be relatively minor compared to the large changes in the environment that adoption of present agricultural techniques caused, e.g. large farms and soil loss, pesticide applications, monoculture of corn and soybeans and wheat in large regions, consolidation of properties into mega-farms with consequent social effects, etc.
