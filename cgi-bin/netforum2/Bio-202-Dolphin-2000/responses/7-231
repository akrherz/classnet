===message:I am not sure I can site research for you on this, although I am sure that several people are working on it. We can reason that somehow chemical messengers within the cell are involved. Exactly how that coordinates the beating of a flagellum so that Eugena moves toward light and the beating of several hundred cilia so that Paramecium moves away from an area are not things I can explain.
