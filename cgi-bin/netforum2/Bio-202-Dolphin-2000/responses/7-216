===message:My understanding is that timing is everything for the antidote  to work. When you breathe nerve gas, the gas must cross the lung surface (or skin/eyes if it is absorbed that way) be carried in the blood and diffuse to the synapses before it has an effect. If you can inject the antidote immediately on first contact, you stand a chance, although I admit a very slim one, but the alternative? I checked with a neurobiologist on the the mechanism of the antidote. The antidote does not affect the enzyme that breaks down the neurotransmitter. It affects the receptors on the post-synaptic cell so they are less receptive to neurotransmitter. The nerve gas poison (an orthophosphate) non-competitively binds to the enzyme, thereby functionally destroying it. The antidote allows the nerves to cope with increasing neurotransmitter levels by having receptors that do not recognize the neurotransmitter. If the nerve gas clears from the body, recovery occurs as new enzyme is made. If you take this antidote injection, realize that there must be profound changes in behavior and performance while the recovery is going on, but agian the alternative if exposed to nerve gas?
