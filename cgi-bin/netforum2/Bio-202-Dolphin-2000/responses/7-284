===message:WIthout a lot of data on this, I would suggest that it is a learned response. They have trained themselves to disreguard sensory inputs. Some people are born without pain receptors, but this can be a lethal condition. However, if some are born without, others may be born with too many and be very senstive. This invites the  idea that there could be spectrum of people out there with none to too many. Some with few may learn to tolerate the self mutilations you describe.
