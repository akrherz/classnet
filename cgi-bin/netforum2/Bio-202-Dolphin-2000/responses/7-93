===message:Entropy, I believe, always takes the form of heat. The friction of a sliding object, the heating of a wire bearing a largfe current, or the warming of an organism during metabolism. Heat dissipates by increasing the the kinetic movement of molecules in the surrounding medium so that the background movement of the universe is gradually increasing.
