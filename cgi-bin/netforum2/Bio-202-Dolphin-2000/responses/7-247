===message:Coiling the tube saves space and allows it to be imbedded in the bones of the skull. If the tube were surrounded by soft tissue, say in a way that the tube was staright and surrounded by brain tissue, the sound waves would damp out. I do not know the comparative anatomy of the cochlea. It would be an interesting question for some  library research.
