===message:GM crops could be such a good thing for our future, and I believe they eventually will be, but we need to take enough time to be absolutely positive about what we are producing. I think there is definately enough people researching and studying this whole area, that we just need to give it a little time.  Rushing things could only cause damage that might be much too hard to fix.  It is a good thing, but we are just not prepared to put it on the shelves right now.

===message:I definitely agree that GM crops have many potential benefits for the world.  I think that you are right when you say that the GM crops could help certain countries out with hunger problems.  I hope that we can continue to do research and proceed quickly so people do not become scared of GM products.  If everyone starts believing that the products are harmful, by the time we determine that the GM products are safe, people may be in disbelief and will still not buy or approve of using the genetically modified products.
