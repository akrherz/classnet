===message:Angiosperm sperm are very small cells with a nucleus and virtually no cytoplasm that live in the cytoplasm of the tube cell. This is unusual, one cell living in another. I do not know the mechanism of movement but as you indicate they clearly do not have flagella. In plants, there is a phenomenon known as cyclosis in which chloroplasts and nuclei move in a cyclical fashion around the periphery of a cell. You can see them move with a light microscope. This movement is due to microfilaments made of the protein actin, part of the cytoskeleton. My hypothesis would be that actin is somehow involved in sperm movement down the pollen tube.
