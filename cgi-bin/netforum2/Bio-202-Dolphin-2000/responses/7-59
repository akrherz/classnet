===message:I do not favor answering 13 questions by typing. I will do it once, but in the future come to the office 
#1. Regarding restriction enzymes, if an enzyme was "programmed" to cut between "AT", how would it know the difference between a sequence of
"AT" and "AATT"? --THe enzyme has an active site that recognizes and binds to AATT but cuts between AT  in that sequence.---#2. Is RNA just a bunch of nucleotides all attached together? Or is RNA more complex?--- It is bunch of nucleotides joined togehter to form a backbone that may fold and be stabilized by hydrogen bonds between bases in one region and those in another. See the structure for tRNA in your text.--- #3. Does RNA ever accidentally attach to
things? Because, RNA is only single stranded, its bases are un-paired, so do these bases ever want to attach to other molecules? I assume thast it would weant to attach but do not know this a fact. ---#4. Why is RNA
processed (after transcription) before it can leave the nucleus? What is wrong with it?--It has introns in it that are sequences of nucleotides that are not needed for coding the protein. These introns are thought to be sites of crossing over during meiosis and are there to promote this process and the creation of genetic diversity in sexual reproduction--  #5. Does DNA code for anything besides proteins? It can't code
for sugars can it? If not, then I guess the only way humans get their source of sugars is by eating them? DNA codes for the synthesis of mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA. It also has regions that function as control elements to turn genes on and off. All of the RNAs are involved in protein synthesis in some way. Many of the proteins that are made by the "reading " of the mRNA are enzymes. WHich enzymes are present determine the metabolism of the cell. SOme enzymes break sugars down, others can make sugars, or fats, or nucleotides, or some amino acids. Those things that the cell cannot make through metabolism must come from the diet.   #6. When proteins are being synthesized
(translation), does the ribosome move across the RNA, or does the RNA move through the ribosome? (understand?) THe ribosome moves along the mRNA, exceept in RER. It requires ATP for the cell to move.  #7. I know how introns are
"junk" DNA found in between genes, but are there introns found within a gene? If yes, how does the RNA skip over that? ---See the answer to RNA processing. Introns are within genes and are transcribed. The junk transcriptions must be removed by processing. Between genes you may find spacer DNA and control DNA._____ #8. Why does the triplet that
codes for START also code for MET? Does that mean that every amino acid begins with MET? INitially it does, but in some cases it is removed after the protein is made by a special enzyme.--- #9. Why is there more than one triplet/codon for a
certain amino acid? Perhaps it was selected to act as insurance against mistakes made? (If a mistake is made, hopefully it won't change the amino acid
sequence?) But then why do some a.a's have more triplets than others?--Don't know the answer to this one. It certainly could be related to insurance that a mutation will not change the amino acid that is inserted. To test this hypothesis you would have to see if the amino acids that have more than one codon are "important" ones in causing protein folding in all proteins. ---  #10. And, why is there one start triplet, and THREE end triplets?--Don't know agian, but the protection from mutation hypothesis is a good one.--- #11. Even
though a mistake is made only once in a billion, aren't there 6 billion nucleotides per chromosome? So there are SIX mistakes every time the DNA gets
replicated? Isn't that ALOT?! It is. HOwever, mutations could be in introns or not cause a change in amino acid that was coded. So the total effect could be nil.   #12. When an insertion or deletion is made, the number of nucleotides is not a multiple of three anymore. Does this affect
any other genes? Yes, it can lead to non-fuunctional proteins or uselessness of the mRNA made from the gene. --- #13. And finally, is a triplet that codes for "end" another way of saying the triplet doesn't code for anything? In other words, because
the triplet doesn't code for an a.a, that must mean that it tells the the protein synthesis to stop?--The triplet at the end actually triggers some events that cause the mRNA and ribosome to dissociate. YOu will learn about it in 302. 

Overall a good set of questions-- Thank you for your patience!
