===message:Sorry, but I cannot really give you an answer although I am confident that you could find out. CHeck out the Library for books on skin. Freckles are due to cells called melanocytes which are in the lower layers of the skin. WHen exposed to sun, they expand: the tanning effect. It could be that a person with freckles does not have a uniform distribution of melanocytes in the skin, but I am only guessing.
