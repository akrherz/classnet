===message:I totally agree with your opinion.  More studying does need to be done.  You can just stop when there are some negative results and just forget about it.  I also agree with putting labels on the products GM crops are in.  It is really the only way to allow the consumer know what they are getting.  But labeling the products may not be as bad as what the farmers think it will be.  A few years ago, food products with olestra in it needed to have a label on it.  There was also some bad publicity for it but if you look in the supermarket, you can still find products with olestra in it.  Therefore, it must be still demanded by the consumers.  The labels just need to tell the consumers what they are getting and what the consequences are.
