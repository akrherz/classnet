===message: A mole of glucose stores an amount of energy equal to 36 or so moles of ATP (remember how much ATP comes from glycolysis, Krebs and ETS). Furthermore, glucose can polymerized to form starch which precipitates out and does not cause osmotic pressure problems. It later is de-polymerized when glucose is needed to make ATP through aerobic respiration.
