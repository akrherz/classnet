I don’t agree with Julia, the benefits of GM products greatly out weigh the negatives.  Although this area is still relatively new, not many things have been said that would put any of this food at risk.  As more information is obtained on gm products better measures of understanding and safety will be met.  But as of now the only thing that seems to be negative about GM are people’s attitudes
