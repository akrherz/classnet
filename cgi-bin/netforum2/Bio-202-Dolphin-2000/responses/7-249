===message:I delayed responding to this question until I could check with a neurophysiologist. Soreness as your describe is not well understood. It could involve micro-tearing of tissues in either muscles cells or tendons which leads to local edema and minor swelling until the repair is is completed. A good question is how is the pain detected. There do not seem to be pain receptors in muscle cells, or at least they are not common. THIs would require a whole different set of receptors and sensory nerves that have not been described yet.
