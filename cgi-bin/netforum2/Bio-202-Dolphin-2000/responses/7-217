===message:If sensory connected to motor only, most animals would not have a behavioral repetoire much greater than that of Hydra. The interneurons makeup much of the neurons that send extensions up and down the spinal cord and most of the brain. It is the arrangements of these neurons and the connections that they make that forms the basis for the delicate movements of eye to hand coordination for a machinist or ear to hand coordination as when a violinist plays a Paganini. Intelligence, memory, regulation of body functions probably all resides in the circuits of interneurons. Think of the CNS as a computer. You can connect sensors to your computer so that you have inputs into the programs there. You can then have outputs to effectors. If you hook a video camera to your computer, you can capture and store an image, and manipulate because of the equivalent of interneurons. Once you have done all of this you can output it to a printer. Which do you think is more versatile: a camera hooked to a printer or a camera connecting to a printer through a computer?
