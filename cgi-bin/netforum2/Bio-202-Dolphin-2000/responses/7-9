===message:Membrane dynamics is an area of current research. The pressing togehter/fusion story I told deccribes the phenomenon, but not he basic mechanism. I am not sure that it is known. It could be that cells in close proximity in an organism have proteins that prevent cell fusion. It is known that if you take cells and bring them close together by centrifugation or treatment with a virus that binds them very close, they will fuse. Essentially, the lipids of one dissolve in the lipids of the other. How the vesicles pinch inward during endocytosis is the subject of ongoing research. Here is a research topic for a young scientist interested in cell biology.
