===message:The equation for water potential gives us a way to predict which way water will flow across a semipermeable membrane. It always flows from a region of high potential to low. Water potential is determoined by two things: amount of dissolved substance and actual pressure on the solution. This can be useful in explaining how water moves through plants. I will be covering it in lecture.
