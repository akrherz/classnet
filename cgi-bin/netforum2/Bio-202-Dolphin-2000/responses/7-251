===message:There are three sets of nuscles in the eyes: those that move the eye ball to the left or right and up and down as well as outward and inward relative to the nose; those that open and close the iris; and those that change the lens curvature. I was talking about the last set. Crossed eyes result with problems in the first set. The muscle that move the eyes inward toward the center line may be too strong and thus the eyes are crossed. I understand one treatment is to cut some of these muscles, thereby allowing the eyes to move outward for normal alignment.
