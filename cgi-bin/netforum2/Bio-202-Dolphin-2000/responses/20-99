===message:I don't think that farmers making money really outweighs butterflies getting killed and the harmful things that GM crops can do to rats.  Besides we have way to many crops the way it is, we don't need genetically modified ones.

===message:Are you sure that the genetically modified crops shoud be tested outside the lab?  Sure it will tell more accurately how the crop will affect the environment, but what if it harms more that it helps.  The article mentioned the possibility of the modified gene being spread to other plants, such as weeds, and I think that would be a difficult mess to clean up, don't you?

===message:I have to agree with Kelly.  People may complain about GM crops because they can kill the Monarch butterfly, however, pesticides kill just as many insects... if not more.  What difference does it make if we kill a corn rootworm or a monarch butterfly?  To me it doesn't matter.  Maybe we shouldn't use anyhting on crops if it can kill an insect.  Farming is a way of life for many people, it is their livelihood.  It is more important to me to see a farmer be successful than to save a dumb little butterfly.
