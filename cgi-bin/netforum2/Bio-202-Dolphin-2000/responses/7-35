===message:Coupling usually means to convert (transduce) energy from one form to another. In chemiosmosis a hydrogen ion gradient is built up by the electron transport system so that there are more hydrogen ions between the two membranes of the mitochondria than in the matrix of the mistochondria. This gradient represents stored energy. If the hydrogen ions are allowed to pass through a transport protein in the membrane, the energy that is lost as the concentration gradient is lost is used to make ATP. It is this passage and loss of energy from the hydrogen ion gradient that is "coupled" to ATP synthesis and the energy that was in the gradient is now stored in the covalent bond holding the third phosphate on ATP. An analogy that I make is that a generator is coupling mechanism. The energy of flowing water can drive the generator so that energy becomes electrical energy. Another way to look at it is that exergonic reactions pass their energy to endergonic reactions.
