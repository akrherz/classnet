===message:I am a bit on shaky ground here, but will attempt an answer. I think it is safe to say, the more vascular bundles the greater will be the root system, but this is probably related to age. Roots continually branch and so do the stems. Obvious the new vascular bundles in these structures have to somehow match up with each other. Furthermore, each new leaf must have continuity with the vascular system of the stem. I would doubt, however, that you could trace each vascular bundle to a particular root. There must be some interesction points. I will try to get a better answer from a botanust.
