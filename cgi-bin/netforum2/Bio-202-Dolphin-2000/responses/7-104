===message:Glass is a good UV absorber. UV light will not pass through glass (or very little will). Hence you cannot get tan by sitting inside a window in the sun. However, glass does allow visible light to pass. Tha is why we can see through it. Plants use visible light (wavelengths from about 380 to 770 nm) for the light reactions of photosynthesis. See the absorption curve for chlorophyll you prepared in lab or the one in your text. Therefore, plants inside a window in sunlight are as "happy as clams:" a zoological phrase for fully functioning. Think about greenhouses. See the answer to the question before your's in this section for an answer on artificial light and photosynthesis.
