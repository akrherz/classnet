===message:Megan- I also find it a little scary that humans have found such a hugely important technology.  It is unsettling to think that someone can tamper with the code that CREATES an organism, and even patent the differences, as if it were a product rather than a living being.  It seems that we are treading a fine line, and we must watch carefully to make sure that life isn't de-valued by the new insights into genetic technology.

===message:I understand your views on genetically modifying living organisms and I agree and disagree.  I agree that we should not genetically alter or clone human beings for our own gain.  However, I don't really consider a soybean or corn plant a living bean and I don't feel it is morally wrong or scary that we can alter these to make life on farmers and consumers easier.

===message:It is scary that people can tamper with the genetic code of an organism.  Makes you wonder if eugenics is going to resurge and humans will be perfect by the end of this new century.  No that will never happen because nature and the environment thrive on the unexpected, and so no order can be brought.  So how much humans try to genetically modify crops it will be to no avail, since something is always bound to backfire.

===message:In response to the reply by Ryan Eisele, I don't understand the logic behind not considering a soy bean or some other plant a living being.  We all know that it is a living "thing".  So why is it not a living being.  I am not clear on the difference.  Is it because it can't communicate directly with us, or that it doesn't feel pain?  Furthermore, even if it wasn't a living being, it definitely affects humans.  It may affect life in dramatic ways that we couldn't possibly foresee.  Plus, genetically altering plants is just a tiny step away from genetically altered humans.  How far are we willing to let it go?

===message:I agree with you when you say that GM crops are a hazard, but I am not so sure yet if they will be such a great help.  I still feel that they pose a danger to human health and the environment.  Yes, it is very scary to think that we have the power to genetically alter organisms, and I do not think that we should have that right.  Yes, I would have to oppose the subject of GM crops also.

===message:I too agree that when the human race can genetically alter an organism that that is a very scary thing. When potentially it can either harm or help us in the end. I feel that this is power that is not meant to be in our hands. In anyone's hands but who's to stop them not the government and not anyone else. We should just let nature take it's course you are born and you die but now everyone's insecurities are further helped with knowledge!!!!!!!
