===message:DNA will be exchanged with the same species in conjugation because there are mating types within the species. The mating types only allow the conjucgation tube to form between memebrs of the same species. IN transduction, exchange is between the same or closely related species because the virus infects only the same species and does not infect just any species. If it di, then transduction would occur between species. Transformation occurs when DNA is picked up from the environment by somehow getting across the membrane. To my way of thinking this would allow any DNA, regardless of origin, to pass into a bacterium. When foreign DNA enters a bacterial cell it can be expressed. Human insulin is now made by genetically engineered bacateria. A human gene (DNA) was isolated incorporated into a plasmid and inserted into a bacterium. The bacteria were cultured and produced insulin. Now done in 50,000 gallon vats and human insulin is harvested to help diabetics. It seems to have no effect on the bacteria, i.e - or +. One could imagine certain genes being transferred that could help or hinder the receiving bacterium.
