===message:Although I cannot find a direct statement in any book that says dendrites can be myelinated, I see no reason why they cannot be. Myelin improves conduction velocity and there is need for both rapid sensory as well as motor impulse transmission. I belive the dorsal horn of the spine contains myelinated inputs, and those nerves are sensory, i.e. dendrites.
