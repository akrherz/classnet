===message:I agree with your opinion on genetically altering crops.  They are too many avenues that need to be explored before such tests are done.  The monarch butterfly was a good example of a consequence of genetically altering crops.  Scientists have too much to consider before they go ahead with these findings.

===message:GM crops have some bad side effects that really don't need to be ignored.  Other animals shouldn't get hurt from these crops just because we think they will bring in more money.  We have enough crops the way it is.

===message:There is just too many questions that still exist about GMO's right now. We should use them in the environment, but they should be handled very carefully. Many more studies should be preformed on GMO's.
