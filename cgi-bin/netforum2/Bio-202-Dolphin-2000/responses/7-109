===message:The tomato example came from your text and I assume it to be true. FOr some plants gibberellin cause fruit development and is used in the production of Thompson seedless grapes (see Fig 39.8 in text). Neither Colbert nor I know of other examples, but neither of us are experts. There may be other seedless fruits produced using hormone treatments.
