===message:II was not sure of the answer to this question and called a couple of microbiologists. It stumped them as well, but here is what they said. It definitely occurs in nature in say soil populations of bacteria. It is not a reproductive process as is binary fission. It is simply a gnetic recombination process separated and not coupled to cell reproduction, binary fission.  Bacteria that do it must have a gene for conjugation. It is more likely to occur under conditions of optimum growth (lots of food) than under starvation. There is one prof who owrks on conjugation in nature, but he was not in when I called. You can contact him by e-mail at randrews@iastate.edu if you would like to pursue it.
