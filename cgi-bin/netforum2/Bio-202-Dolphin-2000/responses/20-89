===message:I agree with your viewpoint of GM crops.  I think that as long as scientists study the possible outcomes in great detail that GM crops eventually will be an improvement to our society.  There is plenty of time for these crops to become part of the environment-scientists need to take this time to make sure that the GM crops will not be harmful in anyway(to humans, the environment, and animals).  I think that as long as these experiments come out "safe", then we should accept the GM crops and advance our food production and nutrition value.
