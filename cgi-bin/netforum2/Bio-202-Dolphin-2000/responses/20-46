===message:I agree with you. As with all things in science, experiment is required. Once we gain a better understanding off all this, we will better be able to weigh our options. Until then, we'll just have to eat food that we are unsure of :)

===message:I agree. It seems nearly impossible to compare the pros and cons when so little is known. Of course the crops are great as long as they don't harm the environment or humans. But for now, there just isn't enough research to decide.

===message:We sometime choose the unsure food in grocery store,
but we believe the food is still under the study. 
We need both opinions from the suppoters and the opponents
to keep investigating the food until they get the certain
result.

===message:I think the panic regarding eating genetically modified crops is a little overblown.  I am much more concerned about the environmental and economic impacts of these crops than I would ever be about eating them.  Although I have heard of a few cases of problems eating genetically altered foods (I read about someone allergic to nuts eating a tomato with nut genes in it, but that may be an urban legend), however, I would almost feel safer eating a genetically altered crop than a crop coated in pesticides.
