===message:It is possible to take a protein and analyse the sequence of amino acids in it. If you know the amino acid sequence, you can backcode through mRNA to determine the DNA nucleotide sequence (what you did in reverse on the assignment). Once you have written down the DNA nucleotide sequence, you can take it to the DNA lab on this campus, and technicians there, for a fee, will make a DNA molecule for you having that sequence. In essence, you have a gene lacking control elements to start and stop transcription. You can get those easily added on because they are well known and in the literature. Take the synthetic gene and put it into a plasmid and insert the plasmid into a bacterium. The bacterium will make the protein.---- We would like to understand protein structure to the point that we could say, "I need a protein with this structure to do this function." If we knew the folding rules for proteins and they were simple, we could then say to get that shape we need this amino acid sequence. Once we know what we need, the synthetic gene can be made as described. This would then give us designer proteins. There is a lot of work yet to be done in this area. People who worry about these types of things are studying bioinformatics.
