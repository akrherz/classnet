===message:I am not sure of the surgical procedure, although it is certainly used. I do not think that they take very much vein. I woudl assume a few inches. The alternatives for the leg  are: shunt the open end of the veins  by joining them to other veins elswhere in the leg, sticking in a piece of Dacron tubing to take the removed vein's place; stretching the vein and joining the ends.
