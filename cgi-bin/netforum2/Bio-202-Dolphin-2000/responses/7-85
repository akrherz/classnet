===message:I do not raise orchids and am on shaky ground. As I understand it, air roots are none absorptive: they have no root hair zone. Their functions are storage, and if green, photosynthesis. If you break off a storage root, you remove the carbohydrate source for non--photosynthetic times--nights, cloudy days, extra energy for flowering, etc. You may also remove minerals that have sequestered there to suport further growth.  If you remove a photosynthetic structure, you upset the metabolic balance. Whether either of these would be sufficeint to "kill" the plant, I cannot say and suspect that you have a better idea from your observations. Aerial orchids obtain mositure and minerals from the air. Rain can contain NH3 and NO3 and various cations from dust. Obtaining resources by this route is slow and slow growth is usually the result.
