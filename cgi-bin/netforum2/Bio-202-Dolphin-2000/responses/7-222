===message:Bruise marks come from internal bleeding whern capillaries are damaged by a blow. The swelling is due to fluids escaping  from the capillaries but not being reabsobed. The swelling may affect nerves in the area, making them more sensitive. Of course a severe enough blow, may actually damage nerve cells, but I do not think this is common. I am not sure that I can offer any insight into color of bruises and pain.
