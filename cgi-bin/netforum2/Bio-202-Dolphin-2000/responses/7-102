===message:Ozone originates from a chemical reaction between oxygen molecules: 3 O2 ----> 2 O3 . The reaction requires an energy input that can come from electrical arcing, as in lightning, or from high intensity UV light. If you are around DC motors that have some arcing, you often smell ozone developed by this process. Ozone is unstable and will break down to oxygen gas by a reverse of the above reaction, releasing the energy that it absorbed as heat. Thus the UV coming into the atmosphere is absorbed to make ozone which breaks down to release heat in effect filtering out the UV. The amount of ozone in the upper atmsophere is a balance between the rate of formation and rate of breakdown. Halogenated hydrocarbon gases escaping from human activity interfere with this cycle and allow more UV to get through. Perhaps the biggest problem gas that we release is FREON. THat is why all new car ari conditioners and appliances now have a substitute refrigerant in them that doe snot interfere with the ozone cycle. CHeck you chemistry book/prof for more details.
