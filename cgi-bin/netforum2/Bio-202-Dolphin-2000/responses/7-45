===message:This was a tough question to find an answer for. It took five phone calls, but finally a biochemist offered a plausible explanantion. --Cytosine is easily deaminated to make uracil. Look at Figure 5.27 in your text and replace the amino group in cytosone with an O; voila, uracil. Since the code in DNA needs to be stable over long periods of time if uracil was found in DNA, you would not know whether it was a normal uracil or one that was recently converted from cytosine. By having cytosine only in DNA, anytime a uracil shows up you know it was from a secondary conversion. The cell can cut our the uracil and replace it with cytosine, keeping the code intact over long periods of time. While the theory is a great one, it must be added that no one knows if it is correct and no enzyme has been found that does this specifically. While this explains why uracil is not in DNA, it fails to explain why thymine is not in RNA. Now there is an interesting question for a future biologist to pursue. Are you up to the challenge?
