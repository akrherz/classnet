===message:I checked with a faculty member in the Food and Nutrition Department about this. He indicated that there are no easy answers. Nonetheless, we do know that fattty acids with a single point of unsaturation are rather neutral in their effects. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, unsaturation at several sites, tend to have complex effects many of which are related to stimulating the body's production of a class or hormones known as the prostaglandins. We are only now beginning to understand how the production of these hormones are stimulated and how the hormones work in the body. THis could be an area of research for a future biologist. If you questions is stimulated by what you can do to improve your chances of a helathy life, he then said reduce your fat intake, possibly leaning toward the more unsaturated fats (vegetable oils) to avoid cardiovascular disease. AT the same time, he indicated that evidence is accumulating showing a correlation between occurrences of cancers and high unsaturated fat intake. THis is an area where our knowledge is limited.
