===message:Yes viruses evolve. Mutations occur in thier DNA in the same way they do in living organisms. This is why we speak of different flu strains--Hong Cong flu etc. It is named from the location where it was first observed and can usually be traced to some ancestral form from a few years before. You can be immunized against a virus. If you have immunity, you produce an antibody that will bind and inactivate the virus. You probably have had a flu shot and polio shot/oral dose. THsdse are made from killed viruses (in activated by formaldehyde treatment or US light) which stimulates your immune system to make an antibody. If one of these viruses invades your body, your antibodies do it in before it makes you ill. SOme viruses are able to mutate to a new form, usually one with a different protein capsid. This fools the antibody that does not recognize the new protein and and does not inactivate the virus. It relicates and it spreads. In evolution, the fittest produce the most offspring and survive. Of course, we simply make a new vaccine and hope to eradiacte it, but then again the virus may mutate. The battle goes on!
