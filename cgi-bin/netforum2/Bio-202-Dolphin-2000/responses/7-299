===message:I am not sure of what spasms you are referring to. At the instant of death, there is ATP in the muscles and they do not die until a few minutes after brain death (think of heart donors after accidents). Several hours after death the muscel go rigid in rigor mortis, the rigidity of death. Muscle contraction occurs because the contractile proteins are preloaded with ATP. ATP is needed for the relaxation phase. After a few days the muscles relax because they begin to decompose. If a muscle decomposes when its antagonist is contracted, a limb may move.
