===message:Cleavage, divsion without growth, reduces the cytoplasmic volume per nucleus ratio. A large cytoplasm to one nucleus makes for a slow cell. The diffusion distances in the cell are too great and surface area per cytoplasmic volume is small meaning that things might not be aboe to enter and leave the cell as fast as they can. Most cells in animals are about the same size, i.e. a whale, elephant and mouse do not have different size cells implying some physical limitation to cell size--probably the ones described above. The hollow ball is a little tougher to answer. I guess I would say it is a stage in morphogenic events that sets up for the forming of the gastrula later.
