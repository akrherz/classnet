===message:Sperm technically do not enter the female's body. Surely they are beneath the surface, but the ssurface folds inward through the vagina to open into the uterus. The internal surface is moist, vascularized, and has a very thin covering compared to the skin, but the body fluids are separate from the chambers of the reproductive tract. Therefore, the sperm  do not act as antigen and trigger an antibody response.
