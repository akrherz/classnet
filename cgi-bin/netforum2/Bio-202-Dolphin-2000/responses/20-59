===message:I think that Sarah raises an important point in her argument - as she says, "maybe it is not the place of humans to be messing with such an issue."  In a sense, I agree with her that we were not the ones who created life (or allowed life to evolve the way it did) and therefore don't have much of a right to try to change it to suit our whims at the expense of other organisms (and possibly our own species.)  However, humans have a unique ability to change their environment, create medication and therapies to extend life, and advance in knowledge about the world.  None of these things is necessarily bad.  I just wonder where the line is between making the world a better place for us without causing any negative consequences for the rest of the environment.

===message:I can see Sarah's point the GM foods should be labeled for the use of the consumers benifit.  However I still Firmly believe that the fodd is safe for humans and it is only the pollen that is harmful to some of the other organisms.  As far as things being better just the way they are is not always true. There are somethings that can use improvements it is just a matter of finding the right way to make the ajustment so everyone or thing can be happy.
