===message:I agree with you completely. Though there seems to be very little to worry about with these GM crops, there could be VERY dangerous side effects if the situation isn't treated right. One concern is that genetic changes are permanent and self-perpetuating. If you eat a GM crop could it change your DNA? It is doubtful, but I believe that I read somewhere that it is possible. How could such changes affect the world, or even the human population? While, I am completely for the GM crops, there is a need for extensive study.

===message:I have to agree with your idea. It is totally necessary that we control this experiments and know for sure what is good and what is not both for our health and the environment.I think it will be better if instead of being the government the one who does it that it will be like a group of different countries so that objectivity is preserved.
