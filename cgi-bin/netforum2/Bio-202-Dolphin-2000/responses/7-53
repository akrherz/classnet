===message:Sickle cell anemia occurs in Africans. Many Africans were brought to the US during the time of slavery. The reason it occurs in people of this lineage is that sometime in the past the mutation that I decribed in class occurred in an ancestor of those who have it. It turns out that sickle cell anemia does have a benefit. HAving the gene coveys some immunity to malaria. A person who is homozygous for normal hemoglobin is susceptible to malaria. A person who is heterozygous is someowhat immune and doe snot have severe anemia. A person who is homozygous for sickle cell is immune to malaria but is debilitated by anemia. Natural selection in Africa, where there is malaria, is for the heterozygote which is best fir for the combination of traits. This is why the mutation has persisted.
