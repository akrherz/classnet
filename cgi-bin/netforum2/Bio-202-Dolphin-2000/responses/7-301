===message:I am not a medical doctor, but I will attempt an explanation. Cancerous cells will often enter the lymphatic ducts which eventually empty into the circulatory system. The cells then are carried throughout the body. Sometimes these cells can leave the capillaries by squeezing through spaces in the capillary walls. THey then can takle up residence in the new location. This is metastasis. Ovarian cells are responsive to estrogen and progesterone. Birth control pills contain a mixture of these hormones that stop the monthly ovarian cell development leading to ovulation (and also the normal hormonal cycle that causes uterine wall development and then the sloughing of it associated with menstrual flow). BY changing the hormaonal balance of your body, you have affected normal cell growth/activity patterns and apparently arrested the cancer. Because I am not an expert, I cannot predict whether this is a long term or short term arresting. You should continue to work with you doctor.
