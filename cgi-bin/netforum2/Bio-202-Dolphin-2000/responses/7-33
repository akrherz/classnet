===message:The phrase "naked DNA"  refers to DNA that is not complexed with proteins. In you text, look up histones in eukaryotic chromosomes. OUr DNA is wound around proteins and probably covered by some others in certain regions. It is not naked. In contrast, prokaryotic DNA is naked. It does not complex with proteins or they do not with it. Both genomic and plasmid DNA is naked in bacteria. PLasmids and the uptake of naked DNA have become important tools in genetic engineering. It happens in the lab and can happen in nature. However, I am not sure how often it occurs in nature; probably at a low frequency. Naked DNA is not just floating around in the environment at high concentrations, but that does not mean that transformation  never occurs naturally. It does.
