===message:I think the urge to micturate (urinate) is triggered by a full bladder. When you produce a urine with a lot of salt and not much water, volume is low. I think this would not trigger the 'urge." However, when you finally urinate, you may experience a slight burning sensation associated with the concentrated urine passing down the urethra.
