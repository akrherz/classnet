===message:Sorry to learn of the accident but glad to hear of the recovery. Muscles generally degenerate when they lose innervation. I am not sure of the time course, but from your experience, it would be after several months. What happened was that when the large nerve bundle was sown back together, the various axons and dendrites were able to reestablish contact with the proper ends: sort of like a telephone trunk cable being cut and the then sewn back togehter where the green, red, purple, etc. wires are able to join correctly in a self-healing process. FOr whatever reason one of the motor nerves was not able to find its mate and that muscle has atrophied. I technically do not know if it died, or is living but completely out of communication with the CNS. When muscles are not used, the amount of contractile protein found in the muscle becomes greatly reduced, i.e. it withers.
