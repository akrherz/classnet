===message:A very important aspect of understanding metabolism is to understand how the activities of enzymes are regulated. The overview is how does the cell make certain reactions go faster or slower, i.e. regulation. An analogy: if you view metabolism as the traffic on a freeway, the orderly functioning of the freeway depends on regulating the speed of the vehicles. Reactions can be slowed by regulating the amount of the enzyme present which is done by stopping synthesis of the enzyme (i.e. regulating gene activity) or by increasing the rate of breakdown of the enzyme, but these processes are relatively slow. For enzyme that exists, it can be almost instantly regulated by binding activators or inhibitors which change the enzyme's affinity for the substrate. Look at figure 6.16 in your text. It shows a metabolic path with 5 enzymes in which the amino acid threonine is changed to the amino acid isoleucine by the addition of 2 carbons and some hydrogens. This pathway is regulated so that the amount of isoleucine that is produced is not too much (and the amount of thronine consumed is not too much). THis is done by having the product of the pathway be an inhibitor of the first enzyme. When isoleucine builds up the pathway shuts down--voila, regulation by inhibition!
WHen operating this provides just enough isoleucine for whatever is needed in the cell and anytime there is an excess the pathway shuts down. This conserves threonine that is used for many other things in the cell besides making isoleucine.
