===message:I believe that is is now possible to separate RBCs and other cells from plasma during the time of donation so that RBCs are put back into donor. THey also can separate platelets etc, and keep them putting other back. Plasma will have antibodies and other natural ingredients of whole blood, but I believe you do not have as much of a potential for blood type incompatability. Type A, B, and O blood + or - are due to chemical characterisitics of RBC surfaces. IF RBCs are not there, then no chance for reaction when recipient receives donated plasma. IN some cases whole blood is needed for transfusion because recipient has lost so much blood that RBCs are too low when diluted out by donor plasma. People get money for blood because there are not enough volunteers to satisfy the demand for blood and blood products.
