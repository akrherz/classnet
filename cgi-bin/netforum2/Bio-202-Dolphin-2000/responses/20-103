===message:I am all for the environment, but until we research the effects of GM crops there is no way of telling what it is going to do for the crops or the animals that live around them.  I will agree to say that if this is not monitored with a strict hand the ecosystem will change drastically, which is why I opt for the follow up with extensive research.  This way the harm to the enviroment may be prevented.

===message:DTT isn't really comparable because that was the buildup of pesticides in higher level preditors.  GM crops would prevent the use of pesticides, and actually do to opposite of what DTT did.

===message:I think that GMO's can be used now. They just have to be handled in a very cautious way. People need to know the effects that GMO's have on the environment so that they can see what GMO's can fully do for their crops. The effect that the GMO's have on the environment can not be found in a lab. I do agree that there should be more research done on GMO's to find what long term effects there are on the crops and other people.

===message:The benefit of GMO use can potentially have such a major impact on the ag industry that it can't be ingnored. GMO's  simply need to be fine tuned like any new product. The only way for this to happen is for research to continue, and that's exactly what is happening.

===message:I agree that GM crops will disrupt the balance of the ecosystem and cause adaptation in insects and other pests, but aren't pesticides/herbicides already doing this?  I think so.  I think that if we can use genetic modification to have the same effect as the chemicals we use now, it will be much better because there won't be all the groundwater pollution issues.
