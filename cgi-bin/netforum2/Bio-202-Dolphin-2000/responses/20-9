===message:This solution of labeling is a good one and one that should be taken into complete consideration.  If the GM crops do help the crops grow or provide some other benifit then they should, as long as it is not a complete toxin to humans and other animals, continue to use it.  But on the other hand, using something that can kill even 10% of a population in a certain area should be reconsidered and possibly re-engineered.  Though re-engineering of an already usable, workable and profitable pollen, or whatever you have, may be unfesiable it should be looked into.

===message:I totally agree!!  There does need to be more research conducted about the side affects of this situation.  Food issues are a major problem, today, and we don't need anydthing else that is unnecessary.  Even though a screening is done, that may not show everything.  Allergies that develop are hard to overcome, and besides why produce more health risks to our people?  There are much better ways of conducting these experiments than on ourselves.  Along with ourselves, there are animal problems that can continue down along the food chain.  We need more research!!
