===message:I agree with this person about her opinion of the article.  I think that in a way GM crops could be very beneficial and helpful to our economy-there are just some steps that should be taken to make sure that these crops aren't going to be harmful in anyway.  The increase in nutritional value and food processing would be a great improvement for our society, but not if the crops are going to cause side effects that not only could harm us as people, but also animals and the surrounding environment.  I think these crops will be helpful in the future, as long as tests are done to make sure they aren't going to backfire and cause problems.
