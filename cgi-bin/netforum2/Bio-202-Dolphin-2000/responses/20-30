===message:I think that Heidi provides a very good analysis of the situation.  GM crops have the potential to help both farmers and consumers, however the negative effects these crops could have on human consumers as well as the ecosystem as a whole are massive.  I agree that we should "proceed with caution" but think it should be extreme caution.  I think that people are getting over excited about the possible benefits of the GM crops and as a result a number of safety concerns are being grossly overlooked.
