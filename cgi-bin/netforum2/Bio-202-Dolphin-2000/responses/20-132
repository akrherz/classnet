===message:What would happen with the slow and careful approach if the effects have already happened? How can the effects of genetically modified crops be reversed? 
What about the option of bringing back the genetically modified crops in order to do more testing and make it safer for the envronment. That way, there won't be more damage to fix when the harm has been found later up the food chain.
