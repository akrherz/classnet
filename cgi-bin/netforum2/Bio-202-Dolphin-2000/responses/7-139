===message:AS well as activating pepsinogen, HCl also participates in digestion. If you soak meat or vegetables in pH 3 acid, they begin to disintergrate as the acid attacks the chemicals that hold both plant and animal cells together. This is called acid hydrolysis.---I am not sure whether amylase is denatured or not. pH 2 to 3 is a realatively mild treatment and may not be suffieicent to denature but I am not sure. The pepsin probably does a job on the amylase, however, so that amylaset no longer functional when it enters the intestine.
