===message:Genes for resistance to mild freezing have been inserted into strawberries. THe nature of this gene is that it prevents ice crystal formation of the leaf surface under very mild freezing conditions overnight, say dipping to 30 F. If a hard freeze occurs, it simply kills the plant as the fluid in the cells freezes, expands and destroys the cells. This is advantage ot growers who plant strawberries that grow in early Spring or late Fall. ----I am not sure that I can answer where it is headed in the space here. This is a complex question. Ther will be a a couple of symposia on campus this SSPring senester that will spend a day looking at this question. Why don't you think about attending?
