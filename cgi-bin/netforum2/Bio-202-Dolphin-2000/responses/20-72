Soon nothing will be good enough as it is naturally.  I'll walk into the hair salon and they'll say, "Damn girl, your hair needs to be genetically modified."

===message:I would have to agree somewhat.  With every new discovery there is going to be some opposition and that is why this subject is so touchy.  Keeping these GM Crops in labs and testing facilities could in fact give us the answers to long term effects but unless groups like the EPA pose restricions on them seed companies are going to market the heck out of them for one reason - $$$$.
