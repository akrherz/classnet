===message:I cannot find a statement in a book that specifically mentions reptiles. However, one genetics book mentions they are found in all "higher" animals. Often when a discovery is made, all animals are not examined for obvious reasons. Many animals in different groups are studied and if the phenomenon is found in animals that are widely dispersed, the inference is that the phenomenon occurs in all animals. That statement stands until it is proven wrong, i.e. exceptions are found.
