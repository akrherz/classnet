===message:There are drugs (chemicals) that can stop the replication of certain viruses and they are used to treat viral diseases. A lot of HIV research is directed at discovering such drugs as well as drugs to combat other viral diseases of human, animals, and plants. Another strategy has been to stimulate the immune system to recognize when a "bad" virus has entered the body so that the body produces antibodies. The antibodies bind to the virus and neutralize it so that it does not cause an infection. Unlike drugs which must taken each time the virus enters the body,once you make an antibody to a virus, you have an immunity for life to that particular virus. If everyone in a population is immunized and the virus has no alternative host, the virus has nowhere to live and dies out--becomes extinct.This is basically what has happened to the polio causing virus. It is a more difficult to manipulate such things as temperature to prevent viral replication because mammals are homeotherms and maintain a relatively constant body temperature, although viral diseaes often cause body temperatures to rise. I thihnk this affects the body more than it does the virus.
