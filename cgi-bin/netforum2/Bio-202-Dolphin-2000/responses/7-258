===message:I am not sure that I can answer this one. In the case of torture, I think you are dealing with sensory overload: pain, heat, light, sound, and mechanical stimulation may all be part of the torture regeme that is inflicted on the victim. It would be difficult to say whether it is the receptors that are adapting to the excess stiluli or the CNS that is shutting down and not recognizing sensory inputs. I think you would have to look at the psychology literature to get a good answer.
