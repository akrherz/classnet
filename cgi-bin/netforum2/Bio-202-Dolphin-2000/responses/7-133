===message:My statement about sequencing of genes was more of an example. The organization of genes on chromosomes is not intuitive. You do not necessarily find that one chromosome encodes all genes for a body region or that say all of the genes for aerobic metabolism are on one chromosome. In fact, things are often quite scattered throughout the genome. NONetheless, the cell can make sense out of it and function.
