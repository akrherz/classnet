===message:You have some good points and it sounds as if you have some background in this area, but I would have to disagree with you.  I think GM crops are well worth it.  There is not suffecient data to prove that Bt is harming animals on a large scale, if much at all.  Also this case is just one case. If this is made out to be what all GM crops are there will be a very negative effect on the field and those things associated with it.  It is not bad. The benefits out weigh the losses (see page 1665) greatly and those things concidered to be losses have yet to be given adaquate support (thats not to say the pros of GM crops dont need further support either)

===message:I agree with your thoughts.  The risks to the environment are not worth the possible benefits of GMO crops.  Yields of corn in the 1930's sustained the population without the widespread use of pesticides and herbicides.  We have the technology to genetically splice genes, why don't we use our resources to research organic methods that can increase crop yield without having detrimental effects upon humans and the rest of the environment.
