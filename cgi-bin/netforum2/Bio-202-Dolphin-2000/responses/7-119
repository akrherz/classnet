===message:The amounts of ethylene given off are very small and I do not believe it would be economically worthwhile. If you put a lot of fruit in warehouse and sealed it, ethylene would accumulate. You could pump the ethylene enriched air out and compress it so that it becomes liquid, ethylene enriched air. You could then let the liquid boil at different temperature, and ehtylene would boil off at different temperatures from ocxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium, etc. Thus you could fractionate the air and collect ethylene.
