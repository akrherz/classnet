===message:THe term "hair cells" as used in the ear should not be confused with the cells that produce hair. They are very different. "Hair cells" in the ear not have hair growing from them. Thehair part of the name refers to the fact that they have sensory cilia that project from their surface. Check your text on cell structure to see the structure of cilia. Chemotherapy does not affect these cells or their structures.
