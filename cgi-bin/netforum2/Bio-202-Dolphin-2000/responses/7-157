===message:Hemolymph is the fluid that circulates in open circulatory systems. Blood is in closed systems. Hemolymph flows into interstitial spaces and displaces interstitial fluid which enters the open circulatory system to become hemolymph. Therfore they are the same in animals with such systems. Blood does not enter interstititial spaces of animals with closed systems, hence they are fluids that can have different compositions.
