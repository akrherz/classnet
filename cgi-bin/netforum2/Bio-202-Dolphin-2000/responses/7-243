===message:I delayed answering your question until I could check a neuropharmacology book. The book did not mention any long term effects of LSD although it did not address taking it on a regular basis for a long time. LSD works by affecting Serotonin (a neurotranmitter) turnover in the synapses of the brain, although it has other sites of action as well. WHen LSD is present, these synapses do not work well and this is manifested as halucinations. Some people who have taken LSD seem to have strange behavior implying some type of damage, but they may well have had strange behavior to begin with or why would they have taken the drug.
