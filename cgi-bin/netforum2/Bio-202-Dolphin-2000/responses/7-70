===message:I hope I did not say what you have written. Most mineral transport is in the xylem, and the direction is upward. Xylem does not conduct downward except in unusual circumstances. Phloem can conduct up or down, but it usually is transporting organic materials, sugars, although I suppose there is some minor mineral transport ability. WHat regulates up and down is subject to debate. Fig 36.13 in your book, explains the source sink hypothesis. I will be talking about it in the next lecture or two.
