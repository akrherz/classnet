===message:Polyspermy is rare because the egg does block the entrance of a second or more sperm: That is what I talked about in lecture--the nature of the block in sea urchins. Sometimes the defense does not work. Usually, but not always, this leads to abnormal development and death of the embryo. A dead embryo will spontaneously abort, but miscarriages can be due tro a number of unrelated things as well.
