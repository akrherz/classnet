===message:Procaryotic genes lack introns and the mRNA is expressed immediately after it is made, in fact while it is being made from DNA the free end is being translated by ribosomes. HOwever, my comment of immediate expression was directed at the idea that there is only one set of genes in a bacterial cell. They are not diploid. Diploid organisms have two sets of genes and a mutation in one set can be masked by a normal gene in the other set.
