===message:I agree with you that when you buy food it should be labeled GM or natural so people will know exactly what they are eating and feeding their families.  However, i believe if we continue putting our efforts into researching GM crops, 50 years down the road food labeled GM could be even more attractive to customers than non labeled food.  GM food in the future could be even better than the real thing.
