===message:Don't you think "the worst idea you have ever heard of" is a little strong? The article mentioned that some rice crops were modified to increase their vitamin A and iron contents. How could this be a bad idea?

===message:I admire you for being able to take such a strong postion on 
such a controversial issue.  I am also cautious about the 
implications that GMOs will have on other species.  I feel 
more research needs to be done.  Is it really worth risking 
the fate of a species to have a crop that produces better?  
We may need to reevalute our motives, perform more extensive 
research and then move on.
