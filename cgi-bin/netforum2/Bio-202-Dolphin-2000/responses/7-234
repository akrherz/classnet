===message:If a tissue swells due to the onset of edema, the lymphatic capillaries can be squeezed shut by the swelling, preventing their acting as a drain.  Young children can suffer dietary protein deficiency edema. If they lack protein inthe diet, they cannot make blkood proteins. If they lack blood proteins, the osmotic pressure of the blood is less. If it is less, then on the venous end of the capillaries, less fluid goes back into the capillaries bewcause of the reduced OP. If excess fluid passes into the tissue spaces, they swell closing lymphatic capillaries: EDEMA results. Growth hormone is produced throughout life byt he pituitary. IN children it is produced at higher levels and the bones are receptive to its effect. After puberty, the bones lose this responsiveness.
