===message:Phloem can conduct material down. Actually it conducts from sourse of carbohydrate to sink. When leaves are active in photosynthesis they are a source and other areas are sinks, such as the roots. Carbohydrate taekn there is converted to starch and stored. AT leaf out in spring, the stored starches are sosurces, and the growing leaves are sinks. Phloem then transports sugars upward after the starch breaks down. Xylem is boring: always conducts upward. Water that goes up has two fates. It may evaporate and escape from the leaf or it may enter the phloem and help carry sugar downward. WHen sugar is removed, it may enter xylem and go around again to leaves where there is a prbablility that it will escape or cycle back down again and so on. Water that goes up phloem in spring at leaf out is held in leaf and helps in its expansion.
