===message:ATP is a molecule. Its structural formula is shown on page 89 of your text. Of the three phospates that are atttached, the past two are attached by realtively high energy covalent bonds. Therefore to make the bonds requires and stores energy, and the breaking of them releases energy. The cell makes use of this molecular property to store energy from food breakdown and to release energy when it is needed. ALthough the chemical reactions are completely different, think of it as a hyrogen and oxygen fuel cell. If you make hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis, you are storing enrgy in hydrogen and oxygen. Later when you need energy, you can combine these two to release the energy that stored. remember, however, that storage and release are never 100% efficient and some will be lost to entropy.
