===message:The regurgitation reflex causes among other things a relaxation of the cardiac sphincter, forcible contraction of the diaphragm and body wall muscles, and reverse peristalsis in the esophagus. It may also cause a lowering of the epiglottis over the trachea, but I am not sure. Furthermore, the pathway trajectory of food coming up the esophagus is away from the opening of the trachea so that it would not naturally scoop any material into its opening. I think there are many times when vomit does enter the trachea and choking results with sometimes fatal results.
