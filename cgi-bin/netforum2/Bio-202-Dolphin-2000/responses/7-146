===message:If I understand your question, the air that enters your lungs is the same air that exhale a few seconds later during normal breathing. The air coming in is "rich"  in O2 and the exhaled air is low in O2 and high in CO2 because of the exchange with the circulatory system. The O2 you breathe in does not leave as the oxygen in CO2: remember aerobic respiration. WHen you exhale deeply and then breathe in deeply, some of the alveoli fill and will not empty until the next deep breath. Therefore, you have some alveoli that are constantly filled and emptied in normal breathing and others that are only periodically filled and emptied during deep breaths.
