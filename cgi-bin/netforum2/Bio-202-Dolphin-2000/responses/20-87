===message:I agree. Although I believe that there are some benefits to GM crops, I'm not sure if these benefits outweigh the consequences at this point in time. If the producers expect us as consumers to buy their GM crops, they should inform us as much as possible and not try to hide things from us by not labeling the GM products. Without more experimentation and research, it makes it difficult to trust our lives and environment to producers trying to force a product on us and make a buck.
