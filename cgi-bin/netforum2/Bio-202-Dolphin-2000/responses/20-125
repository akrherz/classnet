===message:I agree that GM crops are potentially very beneficial, and should be used. I also think that the British may have been a bit to drastic in thier total rejection of GM crops. However, i do feel that stricter rules about how GM crops are tested before being deemed "safe" are neccesary.

===message:I agree, it seems like a lot of people jump to conclusions about GM crops because of what the British did.  Why not use them?  The benefits outweigh the risks.  I think that if farmers want to use them, they should be able to.
