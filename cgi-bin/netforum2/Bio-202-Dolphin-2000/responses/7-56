===message:Mutations affect the exisitng gentic material in cells. If you consider this to be the material essential for life, then it is not surprising that changes in it are usually not beneficial. When an organism is genetically modified, material is usually added to the existing material. Therefore, you have what is essential plus whatever was added. However, additions can also sometime cause problems. Mongoloidism or Down's syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome. ---Genetic modification is usually not done on a single cell basis. A large number of cells (1,000s) ar etreated with the vector including the new genes. SOme of the cells that take it up could die. Only the survivors are used for furtther work. So it could be that additions are sometimes lethal but are simply not seen.
