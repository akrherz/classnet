===message:Although I am not sure that this is the cause of the fainting, K ions are very important in the body because they contribute to the voltage potential across nerve cell membranes. Remember the action potential simulation that you ran? LAck of K could lead to improper functioning of nerve cells. For your information, bannanas are high in K.
