===message:I think that the GM crop phenomenon should be pushed ahead at full force.  I think that this should have been introduced a lot sooner if it had been possible.  The crops will obviously not be placed on the market for people to eat unless they had been tested thoroughly first.  Of course some people are goimg to have certain reactions to GM crops as do some with ordinary food.  Not everyone is going to be satisfied with GM crops because not everyone is satisfied with the crops farmers have been growing for hundreds of years.  If GM crops are going to benefit the majority of the Human population then I think that this discovery should be pursued and taken to full measures in bettering the population.

===message:I think it's remarkable how everything today has to be 
accomplished in mass quantity with the most convenience and 
ease. Okay, so GM crops is an interesting concept, but 
what's the hurry? They might as well perfect everything and 
see what kind of reactions the consumption of GM crops has. 
You know, people have survived on how plants have been grown 
for quite some time & lived healthy and sufficiently. It's 
all about mass quantity now! Plants were grown just fine 
before too. (Note- this is not a SLAM on the GM crops, just 
an observation.)

===message:I also think that there is not enough research out there to have these GM crops out on the market, if they don't quit understand the implications of this crop than why risk the people who are going to buy it? I am against harm to animals and knowing that GM crops kill butterflies and rats is not a good thing, if they kill animals then they may kill humans.

===message:I agree that we need to be cautious with GM crops. Sometimes things move too fast and we tend to do things before we think about the consequences.  I think that we need to figure out if GM producs are harmful or not before we label them.  If we label them now, people who are already scared of these products because of the few studies that have been done definitely will not buy them, and this could hurt our economy.

===message:I agree that more time should be taken to study these crops before they are released.  I think, though, that it may take more than just a few years.  I also think that clearly labeling the products is essential to reduce the risk of potential allergies.
