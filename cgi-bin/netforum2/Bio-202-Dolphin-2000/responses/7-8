===message:ON the surface of cells there are many receptor molecules that bind with specific types of materials in the fluid surrounding the cells. THese receptors bind material and then laterally move within the membrane to form clusters. The clusters are at the site where an endocytic vesicle forms. Potentially harmful materials could be taken in as you forecast. Lysosomes could destroy some of these materials, especially any polymers, by fusing with the endocytic vesicle once it entered the cytoplasm.
