===message:I do not think that blood osmolarity directly effects blood pressure (BP). Rising osmolarity of the blood leads to the urge to drink and to the production of antidiuretic hormone which causes the kidneys to reabsorb more water. If the rising osmolarity is due to high slat intake, it could cause additional water retention beyond normal. This could raise blood pressure and is a reason why high blood pressure patients are asked to control their salt intake. If a person with normal blood pressure and low salt intake experiences increasing osmolarity of the blood, it is probably due to excess water loss (sweating, diarrhea, vomiting). Under these circumstances, BP may fall because there is insufficient fluid to fill the vascular system. THis only happens in severe dehydration.
