When using the GM Crop a little butterfly that has now meaning in are lives will affect use because other animal will need it to live then other animal will need that and so on and so forth until you or you family will be affected by it.

===message:But what happens to the farmers, when scientists find out that maybe the crops that they were modifying were not so safe afterall. Not only do the consmuers get hurt, but so do the farmers. Consumers all across the world will stop purchasing GM crops once the word gets out that the crops are not safe. Yes, genetically modified crops can increase the profits of farmers and they can also make purchasing food cheaper, but in the long run, scientists do not know what the long term effects of the crops will be. The farmers will have to take the chance of growing something that could hurt their great-grandchildren.

===message:Do the positives really outweight the negatives?  I think further research needs to be done to answer this question.  Yes genetically modified crops may help current farmers but in the long run will it really help?  Scientists really don't know the long term effects of genetic engineering, until they do there is no saying whether the positive effects will outweight the negative effects.
