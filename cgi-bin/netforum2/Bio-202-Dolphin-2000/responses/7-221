===message:All animals that have aerobic respiration produce metabolic water. Remember the electron transport system and chemiosmosis? WHat make kangaroo rats (and many marine mammals) different is that they have well developed loops of Henle in the nephron, much longer than ours. THe long loops set up a salt concentration gradient in the kidney which pulls water from the collecting duct. Look at Figures 44.19 and 20 in your text.   This enables them to reclaim more water from their urine than we can and to get by on the metabolic water alone.
