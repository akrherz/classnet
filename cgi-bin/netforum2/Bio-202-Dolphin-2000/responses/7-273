===message:Although their lungs are smaller than ours, so are their bodies so they do need as much oxygen to satisfy their tissue needs. In addition the bird lung is differently organized so that there are storage chambers through which they can move air without breathing. LAstly, almost all diving animals have a dive reflex in which the heart rate slows and blood ciculation prefenetially goes to the brain alllowing lactic acid and build up in the muscles. All of these add together to give these birds the what they need to stay submerged while hunting food.
