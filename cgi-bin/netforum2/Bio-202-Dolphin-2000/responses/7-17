===message:You ask a very perceptive question that shows you are thinking things through. First, what I was trying to indicate is how genes can move around in bacterial populations. These are not genetic processes that go on in nature and are not necessarily to the benefit of the bacterium. SOme viruses when they infect bacterial cells will become "latent," i.e. they do not take over the bacterium so that it makes "baby" viruses. The DNA that was inserted just inserts into the bacterial genome and is quiet--not expressed. AT a later time it may express itself. In these cases the viruse does destroy the cell and nothing is gained. However, I can visualize a situation where latent viral DNA is in the bacterial genome and a mutation happens in part of the virus DNA so that when it becomes active, it cannot make normal viruses and the host cell does not burst. In that case, you have viral DNA plus any transduced DNA (from some other bacterial cell) in the cell and it will pass on to the progeny. WHen this happens genes are moving around in nature by non-sexual processes. Interestingly, similar processes can occur in eukaryotes, and Herpes is an example of latent virus. Some human cancers may result from transduction events when genes governing growth regulation are transduced from one cell to another.
