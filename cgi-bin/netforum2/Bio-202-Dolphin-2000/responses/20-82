===message:I agree with your opinion. GM crops could be very helpful to most people. As for the killing of insects that eat the crops, that's what pesticides already do anyway.

===message:The GM plants were beneficial to some crops such as cotton, but in corn and soybeans the farmers didn't make any more money than they would have had they planted non-GM crops.  If the farmers can't make money there will be no question that GM foods will get faded out by people not buying them.  Ultimately the decision on whether to plant GM crops or not will be up to the farmers and the sales of the crops.  If a farmer can make more money overall with non-modified crops why would they spend more on GM seeds when they know the profits will be either down or the same.

===message:I agree with you in saying that GM crops are good.  I really believe on the other hand that more testing should be done on them.  For example before a new drug can enter the market, the FDA does extensive tests to make sure it is safe.  I feel that the same restrictions should apply to GM crops

===message:GM crops can be dangerous in a situation where you put a protein in a food because it lacks it, then having someone eat that food (who is not usually allergic to it) and having and allergic reaction.  But, I do agree that England has took things too far.
