===message:Good point! I too feel that the possibility of altering organisms genomes is scary and can have disasterous repercussions. Controlled use of GM crops is definately needed, and i feel that more research needs to be done before we use these products extensively.

===message:That is a good point that you made about species all ready becoming extinct and how that would throw nature's curve off even more.  I also agree that GM crops should be tested more and more research should be done, because they shouldn't just throw out a product in the market and not know what it may do to a person.  Another good point that I agree with is that the research for GM crops should be done in a controlled area, therefore no harm will be done to the population if something may go wrong
