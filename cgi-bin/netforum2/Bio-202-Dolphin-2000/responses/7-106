===message:AN interesting question to which I can only offer a speculative answer. Fire is a complex process. Assuming complete combustion, all carbon containing compounds are removed from the wood structure as CO2 and H2O. IF you remove organic materials, the only things left are  inorganic salts of Na, K, Ca, Mg etc. If there is not much of this material in the wood residue, the residue will collapse. If there is more of this material in bark, it may retain its structure, providing it is not disturbed.
