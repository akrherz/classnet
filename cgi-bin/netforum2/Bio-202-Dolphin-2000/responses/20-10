===message:    I agree that we shouldn't rush into mass production of GM crops, but what of the possible outcomes to this discovery.  Refering to one of your responses, you said that there isn't a "food shortage," which may be true, but since we waste so much money on pointless causes why not try a useful one.  The people in 3rd world countries may not be able to afford U.S. food, but what happend to the old fashioned concept of "GIVING" what we discover to preserve human life in general.  It just seems to be all about politics.  Will politics feed a hungery child or give a homeless man a job?  So far, politics shows no results, but until then...........GO SCIENCE GO!!!!!!

===message:  I was just responding to the point that you stated about how it will unbalance the ecosystem.  Genetically modified crops aren't changing anything except that the crops will have the pesticide already in them.  That just means that farmers don't have to spray pesticides on them.  So that is lowering the amount of chemicals put on the crops and into the ground.  The crops are stil going to be the same, it isn't like we are going to grow ten foot tall beans or something like that.  The ecosystem has its problems now but changing a few things with crops isn't going to affect the ecosystem, except that there will be less chemicals sprayed on the crops.

===message:To Michael: At the risk of sounding like a theoretical mathematics freak, I must say that it's simply not possible to predict the long-term or even short-term effects of GM crops on the environment.  I refer to chaos theory.  (The common example given is the butterfly flapping its wings in Tokyo and causing a windstorm in Miami.)  If we fail to take into account one tiny effect that the GM crop will have on one particular, obscure species of bacterium, the effects could be disasterous and far-reaching.  It's simply neither practical nor wise to think we could figure out every effect of every type of GM crop on every living species.

And to Marty: There were several examples in the article of the far-reaching effects GM crops could have on the ecosystem, including the effects of Bt on bacteria and predatory insects.  Ecosystems are extremely intricately structured, and every small change can have huge effects.  Who thought the introduction of the pheasant to Iowa would make prairie chickens die off?  Who thought the introduction of rabbits to Australia would cause an epidemic of rabbit populations unchecked by any natural predator?  Everything changed will change something else, and the results are often totally unpredictable.

===message:It is true we do not quite fully understand the whole nature of the GM crops.  But with the number of farms declining, and the amount of land for agriculture also declining, we need to find another way to feed the people.  If scientists were trying to grow extraordinary plants, which were not needed, then GM crops may be termed wrong.  But we are simply finding a better way to manipulate and create crops which will feed more people with a better source of nutritional value.  Having seed equipped with pesticides on them already will not disturb the ecosystem.  If anything, it will help to not disturb the ecosystem. This way the farmer does not have to spray pesticide on the crops, with more than likely, spreading this pesticide to other plants, in turn killing other species.
