===message:Marine mammals also have a problem of excess salt in their diet, but their kidneys are adapted to this than are ours. Those sections of the nephron that reclaim water from urine are enlarged (loop of Henle) as they are in desert animals. Consequently, they can produce a urine that is high in salt content and get rid of it. This allows them to drink sea water. Birds and reptiles do not have a kidney that can do this and adapted to the marine environment by the evolution of the salt gland to handle the problem. Different animals often handle similar environmental challenges by different means. Think of them as alternative solutions to common problems.
