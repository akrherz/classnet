===message:You are correct that increasing CO2 will increase the rate of photosynthetic output if other things are not limiting. You can investigate this in the Ps computer model that you used to look at stomata. Increasing CO2 n the atmosphere should lead to increased Ps rates, but other factors may kick in. HIgher temperatures come from ther greenhouse effect. THIs can limit Ps in some situations. Polar ice caps will melt, reducing land area. Increasing temperature willincrease the rate of transpiration and evaporation, possibly causing water availablility to be limiting. Increassd temperatures may also increase rates of photorespiration in some plants. My estimaate is that the overall effect is not good.
