===message:Three chamber hearts start to separate the circulation into two paralell circuits. It turns out that in normal 3-chambered heart, there is not as much mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood as you might think. Little flaps of tissue in the heart and aorta leaving the ventricle tend to split the flow of blood that entered the ventricle from the right and left atria. This does set up functionally separated flows although structurally (and superficially) it seems as mixing should occur.
