===message:The one minute circuit time is based on a calculation and not on labelling a single cells and watching it make the circuit. Think of it as an average. Some do it faster and others slower. The calculation is based on cardiac output which is the number of strokes per minute times the volume pumped in each stroke. If you know the total amount of blood in the body, then you can calculate the time it takes to pump 100% of the blood through the heart. As soon as the heart pumps 101% of the blood volume that is present in the body, it starting to pump blood that has been around the circuit once. THese kind of calculations yield a circuit time of about a minute.
