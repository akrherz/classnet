===message:To be correct you should say when the lagging strand is being replicated. Transcription refers to RNA synthesis. Now to your question: its a good one and I do not know the answer, nor whether anyone has looked at it. Your reasoning is good and it would make an intersting hypothesis ti pursue in other classes or at the library.
