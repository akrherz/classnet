===message:The wood we use is secondary xylem. The bark and sapwood is phloem and out coverings. It is removed when wood is processed. The strength question is more difficult. Strength can be defined in terms of compression, stretching, bending and torsion. It also can be deifined in terms resistance to splitting and ability to bear loads.  Different woods are better at one or the other. As a general rule, hardwoods (dicots) are stronger than gymnosperms but they are often heavier. THere is not one wood that is best fopr all purposes.
