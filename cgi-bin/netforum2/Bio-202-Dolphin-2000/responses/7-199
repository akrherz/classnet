===message:As I understand it, circulation to the body part is interrupted, perhaps due to an unusual position. As a result local CO2 levels increase (acidity develops) and oxygen deprivation occurs. The nerves and muscles cannot fuunction normally. If you move the part, the "crimp in the hose" is straightened and blood flow returns. The cells may not act normal at first and we feel this as a pins and needles sensation.
