===message:Photosynthesis is the same in both outdoor and indoor plants. However, the light is different. Light bulds have a a spectral output that differes. Incandescent ligths tend to have low output on the blue end and high on red end of the spectrum. Fluirescent lights tend to be higher blue and lower red. That is why objects appear "warmer" (yellow-red) when seen in incandescent light compared to fluorescent. You may have noticed thsi when taking snapshots with your camera. Grolux fluorescent lights are made with special phosphors to give more red and thus to mimic the sun that tends to be more uniform across the spectrum. BY looking at the absorption curve for chlorophyll, you can see that spectral output of bulbs will make a difference in how much photosynthesis can occur under one lamp compared to another or sunlight.
