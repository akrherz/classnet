===message:Your question is a good one, but not one to which I can offer an easy answer. Both proteins are good at what they do for the animals that have them. Concept of better probably does not apply. Different is a more appropriate term. The differences are to the result of evolutionary experiments, i.e mutation in past were passed forward in genetic lineages that we see today as biodiversity. I mentioned two pigments by name in class but there are several other respiratory pigments found in other animals besides hemoglobin and hemocyanin. THese would be examples of parallel evolution: animals responding to a need to transport more oxygen but doing it in different ways much in the same way that insects and birds have adopted flight but by very different mechanisms. IS one type of flight better than the other? Depends on what you set as criteria for  being better.
