===message:THe only purppose that I can think of is that the column arrangements increases contact between adjacent cells. If you looked at these contacts with an elcetron microscope you would find lots of tight junctions (see figure 7.30 in text) between the cells. This prevents leakage of digestive enzymes into the wall of the intestine where they would wrteak havoc.
