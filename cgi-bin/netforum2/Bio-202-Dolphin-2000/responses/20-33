===message:GM crops, contrary to what you claim, are NOT safe.  Every single change they make to the environment, as I have said before, will make a difference in the long run.  Each of those tiny differences will change something else, probably something bigger, and it will all add up to a huge change in the environment, probably one to which humans will not readily adapt.  The problem with the human species is that it makes changes far faster than ANY species can adapt to them, and it does it happily, as it is blind to the potential consequences.  At face value, yes, the benefits of GM crops outweigh the risks, but people need to be aware of the consequences of each action.  It's a lot more than most people would think; a decrease, for example, in monarch butterfly migration (by 7%, as the article indicated was possible) would both lead to a decrease in pollenation of the plants on which the butterflies feed and a decrease in populations of the predators which depend on the butterflies for food.  Each of these decreases would have its own effects.  And before long, you have a good portion of the species in North America feeling the effects of that mere 7% decrease in monarch butterfly migration.  AS FOR GM crops helping developing countries, did you miss that bit about "suicide crops"?  The article referred to crops which will no longer reproduce after a few generations.  How on earth would that help developing countries?  That would only help line the pockets of the seed companies which are paying for all of the research that goes into this stuff, and obviously they want returns on their investments.  GM crops, I think, will be best for those who design them and worst for those who need them.

===message:I agree that based on this article, the positive side of GM crops outweighs the negative.  But what if these positive arguments are premature?  There is not enough research that has been done over an extensive amount of time that can provide enough support.  We don't know the long term affects that these crops will have on the world because we haven't had twenty years to research the affects.  I agree that we should continue with the development of these products, but I'm not sure that they are ready for widespread usage yet.

===message:I happen to disagree with your argument.  Would you jump into a vat of some liquid just because there seemed to be added benefits.  What happens if that vat you jumped into causes you to get cancer 20 years later to the date and there is nothing you can do about it.  There is not enough information on GM crops to prove that they are safe, I am not convinced by any means.  Some things appear wonderful on the surface but underneath there can be major problems, factors that no one has stopped to consider.  Just be reminded that affects on the environment usually are not instantaneous and take awhile to appear.

===message:In your comment on GM crops, you state that GM crops shouldn't be banned because they are being made for the good of humanity. I agree, but with one reservation.  It seems lately that science has been booming.  A multitude of new products are being invented every year to help humanity. I think that society is all too eager to jump on the bandwagon of innovative technological advances.  We do a lot of talking about "if" we can do something.  Maybe we need to step back and ask if we "should" do some things.
