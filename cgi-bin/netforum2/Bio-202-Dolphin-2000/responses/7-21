===message:Transduction occurs in eukaryotes because viruses that infect eukaryotes can become latent inserting in the host's DNA and then when they come out of the host's genome, they carry some extra pieces. The only process similar to bacterial conjugation that I can think of in eukaryotes is conjugation in Paramecium and possibly other ciliates--see text. Transformation can occur in eukaryotes when a gene from one cell is somehow released and taken up by another. THis area can get a little dicey, and whether it happens naturally can be debated. HOwver, it is used in genetic engineering to get genes inside of cells to transfrom them. Genetic systems in eukaryotes are not as clean as Mendelian genetics would lewad you to believe. There is a lot genetic mobility out there in the real world and one begins to wonder how genetics systems remmain separated in distinct species. Regarding chromosomes, the evolution of a circle into the single DNA molecule which makes up each chromosome is also a bit more complex. Eukaryotic chromosomes have lots of protein (histones) associated with them as well. I am not sure I can layout a plossible evolutionary hypothesis for you other than the o bvious of cutting the circle and adding protein complexes to it. It is intersting to note that when DNA opens up to a string from a circle, the ends are subject to attack and loss of nucleotides. Telomeres at the ends of chromosomes consist of repeated sequences of nucleotides that do not code for anything and are thought to protect the internal coding regions.
