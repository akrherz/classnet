===message:SOme plants are non-photsynthetic. A plant found in Iowa called Indian pipes is one such plant. Their roots form an association with fungi in th esoil that may be mychorizzal fungi with other plants. They get their energy by absorbing nutrition from the fungi. THis is not a common phenomenon, but it does happen.
