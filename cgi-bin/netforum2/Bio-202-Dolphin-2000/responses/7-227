===message:To my way of thinking, what Schwann cells do and what oligo's do, are very different. Schwann cells speed conduction by causing saltatory impulses as we discussed in class. Oligo's function is not well understood, but I do not believe that they are speeding conduction, not do they wrap around neurons as do Schwann's. The oligo's outnumber neurons inthe brain by a ratio of 10 to 1. They chemically communicate with neurons and this has led to the idea that they nutritionally support neurons. THis is probably too simple and idea. Dr Phil Haydon at ISU is a leading expert in this field. You might talk with him to learn more about the oligo- cell types. He was not on campus today, so I could not check with him in preparing this answer.
