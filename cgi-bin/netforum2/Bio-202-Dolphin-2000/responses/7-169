===message:Interesting question and one that would take some library research to be sure in my answer. I don't have the time to do it, so I am going to reason my answer. Bats are mammals. Their mechansim for breathing is different than in birds; they use the diaphragm mechanism. THey may have other adaptations for flight that influences lung capacity and lightens body structure, but I would say that basic mechanism is as we discussed. Flightless birds probably have a the same air sac-parabronchiole mechanism that other birds have. SUch a mechanism would serve a flightless bird as well as a flying one and there would be no selection pressure favoring some other arrangement.
