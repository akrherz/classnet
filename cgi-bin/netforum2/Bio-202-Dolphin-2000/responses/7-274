===message:Some intersting experimental work has been done on insect eyes. Think of each unit in the eye as a TV camera with a narrow field of view. Take a 100 or more miniature cameras and duct tape them together. Each one goes to a separate TV screen arranged on a wall. What you would see when you looked at the wall would be a series of overlapping images where the centers woudl be unique the periphery would be repeat for adjacent cameras. THis is the equivalent of the output from the compound eye. JUst how the insect interprets this is conjecture. We cannot think like an insect. I belive that SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN a few years back had an article on this. It is in the Library if you want to pursue it.
