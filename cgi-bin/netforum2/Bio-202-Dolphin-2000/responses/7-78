===message:Gene control is an area of current research and will probably result in a few Nobel prizes before it is complete. Turn off mechanisms can involve chromosome condesation, protein binding to certain regions, and chemical methylation of portions of the DNA to change the bases in non-dividing cells. How the cell "knows" when to turn things off is the hot of area of research. Not much of an answer, but a very important question.
