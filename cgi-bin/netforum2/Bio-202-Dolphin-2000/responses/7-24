===message:THe effect on the cell depends on the rate of endo/exo cytosis which varies in different types of cells. RBC do not do either; pancreas cells do exo all of the time; WBC do endo frequently. There is turnover in membrane to remove or replace membrane on the surface and this can be done as small vesicle movment one way or the other or a molecule by molecule basis.
