===message:Carnivorous plants probably do not gain much energy from the invertebrates that they trap. THey get energy from photosynthesis instead. What the animal "diet" provides is nitrogen compounds in a usableform. Most of these plants grow in nitrogen poor soils and use the nitrogen compounds obtained from trapped animal decomposition to make amino acids, nucleotides, etc.
