===message:THe word was not in my dictionary. Assuming that it is a real condition that may or may not be spelled correctly, it would seem to be a defect of visual memory rather than vision--the image forming properties of the eye and the transmission of image information along the optic nerve. SO if you have a real interst in this, you should start looking at the literature on visual memory and visual information processing. THis is fascinating area and one in which, I am sure, there is much work to be done.
