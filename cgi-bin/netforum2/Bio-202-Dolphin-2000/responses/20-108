===message:I agree with Laurence, we can not accurately judge a subject in which we do not have accurate knowledge of the subject.  Until we have further research conducted telling us that the GM crops are unhealthy to humans or that they are potientally dangerous to precious animals or bacteria, then it is extrememly hard to make an accurate judgement.  So, bring on the facts and leave the fables at home.
