===message:Donating plasma or blood should not damage the arteries or veins which will heal from the relatively minor needle wounds. Plasma is used to replace blood, but avoids some of the blood typing problems. They pay $25 because that is what they need to do to get the supply. Would your roomy sell her blood for 1$ (or some other low figure)? I do not know what they charge a patient for using plasma in a hospital but I am sure it is well over $100.
