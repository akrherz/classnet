===message:I agree with your idea that we really need to compare the advantages with the disadvatages.  It is really hard to make a concrete decision on such a vast topic when it is so new and not much is really known.  I also think that we really need to get this information that we have found out to the public, though, and get some more opinions.  I don't think very many people are educated in this area, and so it is hard for them to understand what we are really dealing with.

===message:I also agree with your opinion, because I also think
we should study futher in each case. I think any new 
technology for GM products has to be investigated until we 
totally understand them

===message:I think I would almost agree with you.  But the thing is, I don't think it's even possible to know everything about GM crops and the branching effects they would have on ecological systems.  And because of that, I don't think it will ever be safe to use them.  Most certainly not when they have built-in pesticides.  I don't want to eat food that is used to kill insects, and I'd be even more hesitant to feed it to small children whose bodies would be affected by them more strongly than my adult body would be.  But if there was somehow a way of inserting a gene that would produce some sort of completely harmless scent which the insects disliked and naturally avoided, I might not have a problem with that.  However, I doubt any molecule in existence is completely harmless to every species, so I don't think such a thing is possible.
