===message:WIthout reading the article, I cannot answer your question. The distal tubule (see figuree 44.19 in your text) is involved in ion secretion and absorption. COnsequently it plays a role in the  Na and K ion balance of the body and in regulating blood pH through HCO3 reabsorption. IF I were looking for a reason that the distal tubules are near the surface, I would look at this. On the other hand, it could be that the rodents have long loops of Henle, and in order to get the loops in the loops into the package (the kidney) the distal tubules are displaced to the periphery.
