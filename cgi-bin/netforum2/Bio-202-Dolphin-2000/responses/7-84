===message:Petrified wood is most likely xylem. WHat has happened is that the wood was buried quickly by a mud slide or flood. Deep in silt ther eis little oxygen and little decay. Minerals infiltrate the xylem and crystalize. If it then dries or is further buried and compressed over eons of time, the cellulose gradually breaks down and is replaced by more salts. Eventually what was a tree becomes stone. Erosion of the area where this happened exposes the petrified wood.
