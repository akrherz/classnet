===message:I do agree that more research needs to be done in this area.  If more research is completed, then we would know the benefits and the risks of genetically modifying crops.  If there is a risk to a certain species, then it should not be approved for general use by the public.  This way we could reap the benefits of this advanced technique in our global economy.

===message:I also agree that there would be great benefits to the use of GMOs. It would give us a larger food supply because more of what we produce can be used by humans and not insects or weeds. At the time they seem to be relatively harmless but, not much research has been done in this feild. I would have to say that at this point I am against them until I know for a fact that their products are not toxic or harmful to people or the environment.
