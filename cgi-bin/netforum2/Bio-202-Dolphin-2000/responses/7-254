===message:Obviously the nerve net meets the needs of the animals that have them or else they would be extinct. ON the other hand, they are not necessarily the most successful animals in terms of numbers. The nerve net is superior to a condition of no nervous system as in sponges, but seems rather primitive against the vertebrate system. Likewise for nerve rings. Evolution is not toward some ideal goal. It is about animals (and other critters) being able to maske a living and reporduce so that their genes combo's continue through time. To that end, the animals with these types of nervous systems have been successful.
