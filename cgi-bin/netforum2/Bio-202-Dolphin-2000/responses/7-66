===message:I do not as a fact that eating large amounts of normal poppy seeds will lead to drug test failure. I will accept your statement. ===The edible poppy is a different cultivar (variety) of poppy from the drug one. This has come about by selection, human selection, I presume. Furthermore, the seed of the opium poppy does not contain any opium. Opium is contained in other parts of the plant. It is possible that there are residual amounts of opiate-like compounds such as breakdown products or precursors in seeds and this could lead to the drug test failure. Urinanalysis is based on gas chromotography that is incredibly sensitive.
