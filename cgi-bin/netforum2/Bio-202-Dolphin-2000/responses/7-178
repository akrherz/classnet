===message:For recording purposes this is treated as one question. 1) Theoretically you could get a pressure reading by inserting a very sensitive pressure "reader" in the end of one of the major vessels leaving the pumping organ. HOwever, open systems are not pressure systems. recognize that blood pressure drives capillary exchange in cclosed systems. Open systems are flow systems and hemolymph simply flows into insterstitial spaces; it is not filtered throught blood vessel walls. 2) HIV viruses avoid the immune response by invading cells and inserting into the host cells DNA as a provirus. It can remain latent for years. WHen viruses are produced and exit the cell, they are covered by a piece of the cells membrane. This is seen as "self' by the immune system. 3) THe interaction of antibodies with antigens is not enzyme catalysed in any case I know of. There are some proteins called complement proteins that speed antibody response, but they are not enzymes.
