===message:The appendix is a vestigal (remnant, evolutionary reduced) caecum. In  many herbivores (ruminants excluded), the caecum is a place where food is temporarily stored. It is greatly enlarged compared to the appendix (see figure 41.17 in text). Bacteria in the caecum digest food that passes into it (read page 808 in text) allowing the animals to gain extra nutrition from a meal.
